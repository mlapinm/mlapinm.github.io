00:23
What is your project about Tofu
00:26
We have to raise money for the class show
00:30
We have to make and sell something
00:34
So what have you decided to make
00:38
That’s where the trouble is I can’t think of anything
00:43
I wish I had some magic and I could just get as much money as I wanted
00:52
In fact I would use the magic to become the richest person on Earth and sit back and relax the whole day
01:03
I would do nothing else well Tofu you do know that there is more in life then only being rich
01:14
People like you more when you are honest hard-working and humble
01:22
That’s how Aladdin found his Princess and lived a happy life
01:27
Aladdin Who is that
01:31
I’ll tell you
01:46
Once upon a time there was a young boy named Aladdin
01:53
He lived with his mother and his pet monkey in a poor village of Arabia
02:08
The only relative Aladdin and his mother had was a distant uncle who hardly kept in touch with them
02:22
One day when Aladdin and his mother were finishing their daily chores Aladdin’s uncle showed up
02:33
Brother What a pleasant surprise
02:37
How are you sister How is your son
02:42
We are both good brother
02:44
It has been many years since you have visited us
02:48
Aladdin this is your uncle
02:54
You saw him once when you were a little baby
02:59
Hello uncle
03:01
Oh What a young lad he has become
03:07
But I am sorry to see the state of thing you have to live in sister
03:15
I have a proposition
03:17
Let me take Aladdin with me and I will find him some work
03:21
Once he has earned enough he can come back to you
03:31
Till then keep this piece of gold to make your living
03:38
Oh brother That is a wonderful idea
03:45
It will do Aladdin good to learn some work with you
03:56
The next morning
03:59
Aladdin and his uncle left
04:11
They walked through many villages and towns
04:25
Till one day they came to a quiet place outside one of the villages
04:37
There were many caves and tunnels there what are we doing here uncle
04:48
I have a job for you here
04:51
Here uncle But there is nothing here except these rocks and caves
04:58
Look there under the tree
05:03
There is a large stone with a ring on it
05:10
I want you to lift it
05:13
Okay uncle as you say
05:32
Please help me uncle this rock is very heavy
05:40
No I can’t help you It is your job you have to do it
05:58
It’s opening It’s opening uncle
06:03
I can see a narrow passage and some stairs leading further down
06:16
Very good job my boy Now I want you to go in there
06:21
But before you go here wear my ring this is a magical ring
06:29
It will keep you safe
06:31
Yes uncle
06:34
Aladdin follows his uncle’s directions and goes down the stairs
06:45
Once at the bottom he sees that it is a large cave filled with many jewels and gold coins
07:00
Pick up the large gold plates and urns fill them up with gold and jewels
07:08
Pick up anything else that you thing maybe worth something
07:14
Aladdin does as his uncle had told him
07:19
He stuffed the large urns with many precious items and made his way back towards the staircase
07:35
On his way out he saw a small dusty lamp
07:42
Although it didn’t look precious he decided to take it too and tucked it into his shirt
07:55
When Aladdin had reached the top of the staircase he called out to his uncle for help
08:02
Here uncle Please take these urns and then pull me up too
08:08
I cannot get out by myself the opening is too far for me
08:14
Yes yes Give me the urns
08:17
Okay uncle now pull me out
08:27
Pull you out So that you can go and tell everyone where the treasure is
08:34
Never
08:37
I brought you along because this is a cursed cave
08:41
Only a small boy can go in and out of it
08:46
I have what I wanted…
08:49
I don’t have to come back for more for a long time
08:55
Saying so Aladdin’s uncle shut the cave’s opening with large stone that had a ring on it leaving Aladdin behind in the cave
09:12
Aladdin was shocked but he stayed patient
09:21
Uncle has betrayed us
09:24
But I must find a way out and get back to my house
09:30
Dear God show me a way out of here please
09:35
Aladdin joined his hands and bowed his head to pray
09:40
As he put his hands together his fingers rubber over his uncle’s magical ring
09:47
And a creature came out it
09:58
Yes master you called me
10:03
Who are you
10:05
I am the slave of this ring and whoever wears it
10:10
I must obey any one command of the master of the ring and then the ring will be destroyed freeing me
10:22
How may I serve you my master
10:26
Can you please get me out of here and back home to my mother
10:31
Yes master Right away
10:38
The next moment Aladdin was home with his mother
10:43
His mother was surprised to see him back home so soon and in such an abrupt manner
10:52
My son You have returned so soon
10:56
Where is your uncle
10:58
Have you already earned so much money
11:02
Uncle cheated on us mother
11:04
I will tell you everything but first give me something to eat
11:09
I haven’t eaten anything since yesterday
11:13
Aladdin’s mother served him the remainder of the food as he told her what had happened and how his uncle had tricked and abandoned him
11:23
I can’t believe my own brother would do this to us son
11:28
I am glad you are home safe now
11:32
But the gold coin your uncle gave me has run out and we have nothing to eat now
11:40
Don’t worry mother
11:42
I have this lamp I will go into the market and sell it tomorrow
11:46
Let us sleep for now
11:52
Relieved that they were together
11:54
Aladdin and his mother slept peacefully that night
12:00
The next morning Aladdin asked his mother for the lamp
12:06
Mother I am very hungry
12:08
Give me the lamp I will go sell it so we may have some bread
12:14
Here son take the lamp
12:17
But clean it nicely and polish it before you go to the market
12:22
A shiny lamp will fetch you more money
12:25
Yes mother
12:45
As Aladdin started rubbing the lamp clean with his shirt a magical creature appeared from it
13:01
Yes master What is your command for me
13:06
Master…
13:09
Are you like the creature of the ring
13:11
Yes master he is my brother And I know that he freed you from the caves
13:23
What is going on Aladdin Who is this
13:29
Don’t worry mother
13:30
This is a magical creature of the lamp
13:33
He will grant us anything we wish for
13:39
Call me Genie my master
13:43
Very well Genie please get us something to eat We are very hungry
13:49
As soon as Aladdin had said it several silver plates appeared with a variety of food in them
14:05
The genie went back into the lamp while Aladdin and his mother had a hearty meal
14:20
When it was evening they were hungry again
14:26
Its time for dinner What shall we do
14:30
Should I call the genie again
14:33
No…look he has left us with these silver plates
14:43
Go and sell them in the market We will buy bread after that
14:48
Aladdin agreed with his mother and took one of the silver plates to the market
15:02
He saw a Turkish trader and decided to strike a deal with him
15:08
But Aladdin didn’t know the value of his silver tray or how to do business
15:22
How much you want for this tray
15:24
Please give me whatever you think is fit I trust you
15:29
Okay take one gold coin
15:36
Okay thank you
15:39
The trader was surprised by Aladdin’s innocence and was tempted to tell him that he had made a mistake and that the tray was of even lower value than he had quoted
15:53
But instead he let him go
16:01
Such an innocent boy
16:04
He didn’t even bother to find out the actual value of the plate
16:12
Perhaps I should have given him the fair value anyways
16:20
With the gold coin he had got Aladdin bought food and other necessary supplies for his home
16:30
But within a few days they ran out of all the supplies
16:37
So Aladdin went bank to the Turkish trader and sold him another plate
16:48
This time the trader gave him two gold coins
16:53
Again Aladdin bought food and supplies for his home
17:01
This went on for many days till Aladdin ran out of all the silver plates
17:17
Son there is no food in the house
17:20
And no plates to sell as well what shall we do now
17:25
I will rub the lamp and call the genie again
17:59
Yes master How can I help you today
18:05
There is no food in the house
18:07
Can you get us some food
18:10
Yes of course master
18:15
Once again the Genie brought them food on many silver plates
18:30
Although Aladdin had the magic lamp they never used it to satisfy any greed
18:37
They continued to live frugally except now his mother started saving a little money from the sale of every silver plate
18:55
Like this in a few years’ they had enough money to live a decent life
19:04
Aladdin even became a merchant and almost never used the lamp again
19:12
One day he was returning from work he happened to see the Princess as her procession passed from the street
19:32
Mother I am in love with the Princess and I have decided to marry her
19:39
I will present her with many jewels and precious things that we have collected over the years
19:55
Aladdin went to the King and asked for his daughter’s hand in marriage
20:02
The King saw the honesty in Aladdin’s nature and agreed
20:08
Aladdin married the Princess and showered her with all the riches he had
20:16
The news of the happy couple spread across the land till it reached his uncle
20:23
So Aladdin got out and betrayed me
20:29
He found a magic lamp and didn’t tell me
20:33
I shall kill him with my own hands and get the lamp from him
20:41
One day when Aladdin was away at work his uncle went to his home and stole the magic lamp
21:02
He then ordered the Genie to transport the whole house into the middle of the desert where no one can find it
21:20
What have you done Where is Aladdin
21:24
You will never see him again
21:27
Now you are liable to me
21:30
You will do as I tell you
21:35
Now go and get me some wine and dinner
21:39
The Princess did as she was told but as she did so she planned her escape too
21:50
She mixed some sleeping powder in his wine and gave it to him
21:55
As soon as he had drunk it he fell into a deep sleep
22:03
The Princess quickly reached for the lamp and rubbed it
22:11
The Genies appeared
22:17
Yes Mistress How may I serve you
22:21
Save me Genie Please find Aladdin and get him here
22:26
Yes Mistress
22:31
The next moment Aladdin was there
22:40
He saw his uncle sleeping and the Genie present
22:44
He understood what had happened immediately
22:51
He waited till his uncle got up and then he killed him he Then told the Genie to take them back home
23:10
The Genie did as told and they continued to live their happy life
23:28
Hmmm…So he took the hard way What a good man Aladdin was
23:36
Yes he was
23:39
Well I think I too want to be honest and sincere like him
23:45
I am never going a look for short cuts or be lazy again Tia
23:50
I promise
