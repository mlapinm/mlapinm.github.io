Hey guys
00:24
Hello
00:28
What do you want
00:31
Can I play with you guys
00:34
This is a game for big kids
00:36
Go away
00:41
Actually…why don’t you stay to hear a story
00:44
I was about to tell my brother
00:47
Okay thanks
01:05
Once upon a time there lived a king who had 12 beautiful daughters
01:13
He loved the princesses dearly
01:18
But one thing about them worries him a lot
01:29
I cannot understand what my daughters do because of which they need a new pair of shoe every morning
01:36
How can it be that their shoes are fine through the day but in the morning they are worn out completely
01:46
To find the truth behind his daughters’ shoes the king announced in the kingdom that anyone who uncovered the secret would be awarded handsomely
02:04
Many people came but no one could understand how the princesses managed it
02:18
One day an old soldier decided to go the palace
02:30
As he was walking he came across an old woman
02:35
Where are you going
02:41
I am going to the palace
02:43
I would love to solve the mystery of the princesses and become a king one day
02:49
That’s not very difficult
02:51
Here take this invisibility cloak and use it when the time is right
03:01
Nobody will be able to see you as long as you wear it
03:10
Just be weary not to drink the wine that one of the princesses will bring you
03:17
The soldier thanked the woman and went on his way to the castle
03:29
Once there he went to meet the king
03:40
I can find the truth behind the worn out shoes of the princesses
03:46
If you fail
03:47
I will have your head cut off
03:52
And if I do it you will allow me to marry one of your daughters
03:58
You have courage young man
04:00
Very well you will sleep in the princesses’ room tonight
04:17
The soldier was introduced to the princesses and given a cozy bed in the princesses’ room
04:30
Just before he was about to sleep a princess brought him a glass of wine
04:54
He only pretended to drink it and lay down on his bed and pretended to sleep
05:05
After some time the eldest princess came up to him and checked if he was asleep
05:15
He is fast asleep sisters
05:18
Let’s go
05:21
All the sisters got together and pulled out prettiest of their clothes and got dressed
05:33
All of them were excited except the youngest one
05:43
I am not sure about this sisters
05:46
I think something will go wrong tonight
05:50
Oh you simpleton
05:52
You worry unnecessarily
05:54
Nothing will happen
05:56
Now come lets go
06:11
The eldest princess then went to her bed and clapped twice
06:17
The bed sunk to the floor and a secret stairway opened underneath
06:26
All the princesses followed one after the other
06:40
The soldier also quickly got up and put on the cloak
06:50
He then followed the princesses onto the stairway
07:06
But halfway through he accidentally stepped on the gown of the youngest princess
07:13
I am telling you sisters
07:15
Something is amiss
07:17
Someone has caught hold of my gown
07:22
Don’t be a fool
07:25
It might just be a nail
07:27
Now stop crying or you will delay us
07:39
All the princess followed by the invisible soldier made their way to the bottom of the stairs
07:46
They found themselves in a beautiful grove of fruit laden trees and flowers made of silver
07:55
Beyond the grove was a lake where twelve handsome princes awaited the princesses in twelve small boats
08:15
The princesses rushed to their beloved each and got into his boat
08:30
The soldier sneaked into the boat with the youngest princess
08:38
The boat is very heavy today
08:45
I don’t know what is happening today everything is wrong
08:52
The princesses and the princess reached the other side of the lake
09:04
There was another beautiful grove there
09:07
It was lit with a thousand lamps and music wafted throughout
09:15
Let’s go sisters
09:21
Everybody got off the boats and into the grove
09:38
The princesses and princess danced with each other like there was no tomorrow
09:44
The soldier hid himself in one corner and watched everything
10:00
The princesses danced through the night and when morning came they returned to the palace and slept
10:27
So this is where the princesses go
10:30
And this is why their shoes wear out overnight
10:34
Let me see what they do tonight
10:49
The soldier waited and watched
11:25
The same thing happened again
11:37
The next morning the soldier told the king what he’d found out
11:44
The King called his daughters
12:02
Is it true what the soldier has to say
12:06
Yes Father
12:09
Well soldier… looks like you have earned your reward
12:13
Which Princess will you marry
12:17
I am not very young now so I would like to marry the eldest princess
12:30
The soldier and the Princess were married on the same day and he became the heir of the king
12:39
Arrogance doesn’t help people too much does it Tia
12:44
No it doesn’t
12:47
I am sorry
12:48
I was mean to you
12:50
We’ll be back here to play tomorrow
12:53
Why don’t you come and join us then
12:57
It’s okay
12:58
I will see you tomorrow
12:59
Bye for now thanks for narrating the story Tia
13:06
Bubbye
13:09
