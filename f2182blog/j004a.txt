22.949696
Also, remember to download and use the Anki flashcards with the link in the description.
28.517701
Let’s get started.
30.690094
This second lesson is about interfaces and cables.
34.668769
In the last video we talked about some different kinds of devices you will find in networks.
39.697373
This lesson will focus on how we connect them, specifically how we connect them with cables.
46.348123
Wireless connections are also a topic we’ll cover, but that’s for later in the course.
51.215276
Take a look at this photo.
54.528859
This is the front of a switch.
57.006555
Notice the 24 interfaces, also known as ports.
61.373383
Remember, as we learned in the last lecture, one characteristic of switches is that they tend to have lots of interfaces to connect end hosts like PCs and servers to.
71.65631
Now let’s look at that those words above the interfaces.
74.793839
I’ll zoom in.
76.51252
10/100/100Base-T ports (1 – 24) – Ports are Auto-MDIX.
86.575037
Unless you’ve already studied this stuff, you probably have no idea what that means.
91.511354
Don’t worry, by the end of this video you’ll understand all of this and more.
96.915025
Now let’s focus on the interfaces themselves.
101.051182
I’ll zoom in again.
102.790027
Do you recognize this shape?
105.403719
If your computer is connected to a wired network, it’s surely using a port like this to connect to the network.
112.093975
These are called RJ-45 ports.
115.566599
RJ stands for Registered Jack, by the way.
119.627976
Let’s look at the RJ-45 connector at the end of a cable, I’m sure you’ve seen one before.
126.041488
These are all cables with RJ-45 connectors.
130.278674
As you can see there are some variations in design and color, but all of these connectors would fit into the ports we saw in the previous slide.
138.826723
The RJ-45 connector is used on the end of a copper Ethernet cable.
145.146341
There are Ethernet cables which do not use copper wiring as well, but we’ll get to that later.
151.097361
First of all though, what is Ethernet?
154.84027
Ethernet is a collection of network protocols and standards, rather than just a single protocol.
162.101191
So really Ethernet isn’t one single thing, making it difficult to define exactly what it is.
168.962263
For the purpose of this lesson, we will focus on types of cabling as defined by Ethernet standards.
176.072453
As said above there are many standards included in Ethernet, but the focus of this lesson is interfaces and cables, so that’s what we’ll focus on.
186.307266
However, we will learn other aspects of Ethernet in future lessons.
191.025193
Now, before we learn about Ethernet cable standards,
195.181414
I want to give a brief explanation of why we need network protocols and standards.
199.811316
If two people are talking to each other, and one only speaks English, and the other only speaks Japanese,
207.337071
there’s not going to be a much, or any, communication between them.
211.75609
What they need is some agreed upon system of communicating, like a common language between them.
218.176812
Network protocols serve that purpose for network devices.
222.528363
That’s why standards like Ethernet exist.
225.52637
Since we’re talking about interfaces and cables in this video, here’s a more relevant example.
233.067688
If you’re trying to connect to, for example, a network switch,
237.591115
but the maker of the cable and the maker of the switch haven’t agreed upon the size and shape of the connector and port,
244.563736
you won’t be able to connect them.
246.535773
That’s why there are industry standards that all vendors follow, both in terms of physical standards like connectors and cables like these, as well as logical standards, like IP, the internet protocol.
259.464676
Now, connections between devices in a network operate at a set speed.
266.11362
These speeds are measured in bits per second.
269.661013
What is a bit?
271.287648
Well it’s a value represented by either a 0 or a 1.
277.0813
This binary code is how computers work.
280.209188
YouTube, this video, your operating system, all of it just a series of 0s and 1s which your computer interprets.
289.771715
When communicating across a copper network cable, a variation in the electrical signal is interpreted by the receiving device as a 0 or a 1.
300.162645
So, that’s a bit, what’s a byte?
304.473737
Here we have a series of 8 bits.
308.577261
8 bits is equal to 1 byte.
312.68484
Now, speed is measured in bits per second.
317.315458
Imagine a byte, 8 bits, of data being sent along a wire.
322.734298
It reaches the neighboring device one bit at a time like this.
327.243088
It doesn’t operate one byte at a time like this.
330.809341
So, remember, speed is measured in bits per second,
336.790824
for example kilobits per second, megabits per second, gigabits per second, and not bytes per second.
344.777421
Data on a hard drive for example is measured in bytes, however,
349.418001
so remember a Gigabyte is actually 8 times larger than a gigabit.
354.23983
So let’s review some of these measurements.
358.055519
1 kilobit is equal to 1,000 bits.
362.922418
Add three zeroes to that And you get 1 megabit, which is 1 million bits.
368.619887
Add another three zeroes, And you get one gigabit, or 1 billion bits.
374.647336
Add another three zeroes to that and you get one terabit, 1 trillion bits.
381.190616
You’re not going to see larger units than this when it comes to network speed, and really you’re not going to see terabits either.
389.734482
Speeds are always increasing, however, so terabits-per-second speeds may be commonplace soon enough!
395.005783
Now, there are further units, here’s a snapshot from wikipedia.
399.768218
Beyond terabits there are petabits, exabits, zettabits, yottabits, and more.
407.03194
Don’t worry about memorizing all of these though, you’re not going to see network speeds like these anytime soon!
413.003242
Okay, finally lets talk about some Ethernet standards.
417.709531
These are all defined in the IEEE 802. 3 standard.
423.176438
The IEEE is the institute of electrical and electronics engineers.
429.167282
You’ll notice all of these Ethernet standards begin with IEEE 802. 3.
435.716724
Let’s take a look.
436.972244
So, here’s a table of some IEEE standards for copper Ethernet cables.
443.462703
We’ll also take a look at fiber optic cables later in this lesson, but I decided to split them up.
450.582554
We have one for each of the common network cable speeds, 10 megabits per second, 100 megabits per second, 1 gigabit per second, and 10 gigabits per second.
462.595293
The next column lists the common names.
466.398029
These are the names we usually use when talking about different networks interfaces, cables, and their speeds, for example in a work environment.
474.7461
The next column lists the official IEEE standard in which they are defined.
480.702845
You would probably never use these names when talking with other network engineers about a cable, but you should be familiar with them.
488.122463
This next column lists informal standard names given to each standard.
494.520426
10 base-T, 100base-T, 1000base-T, and 10gbase-t.
501.58363
The numbers obviously refer to their speeds.
505.442596
How about base and T?
507.673944
Well, base refers to baseband signalling.
511.793862
That’s totally out of the scope of the CCNA, but just so you know the meaning.
516.068096
T refers to twisted pair cabling, and we’ll talk about that very soon!.
521.304137
Finally, the maximum cable length.
525.673685
Notice that all of them are 100 meters, that’s the maximum length for twisted pair cables as defined in Ethernet, for performance and technical reasons.
535.381517
So, that’s a lot of information, but I recommend you memorize these standards.
540.593579
It may seem difficult, but with the flashcards in the description, it’s actually quite easy!
546.10575
So, don’t forget to download and use the flashcards in the description, and also make your own if you want.
552.01388
Okay, now let’s continue and look in more detail at the physical cables themselves.
556.777073
The copper cables used in Ethernet standards are UTP cables.
562.908527
UTP stands for Unshielded Twisted Pair.
568.041549
Unshielded means that the wires have no metallic shield, which can make them vulnerable to eletrical interference.
575.387849
The Twisted pair part is easy to understand from this photo, as you can see there are four pairs of cables twisted together.
583.491209
The twist actually helps protect against eletromagnetic interference, or EMI.
589.801892
So, there are four pairs of wires twisted together, that makes eight wires in total.
595.280107
Let’s take a look at one of those RJ-45 connectors we saw earlier
599.889623
If you count the number of pins here, you’ll find that there are 8 pins, 604.672989
perfect for the number of wires we saw in the last photo.
607.776971
However, not all of the Ethernet standards we saw before actually use all 8 wires.
613.898582
10BASE-T and 100BASE-T, also known as Ethernet and Fast-Ethernet cables, use 2 pairs, or 4 wires.
622.87414
1000BASE-T and 10GBASE-T, however, use all 4 fours, or 8 wires.
629.792268
Let’s focus on the first two for now, 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T.
636.428112
So, let’s say we’re connecting a PC to a switch with a FastEthernet connection.
642.356621
These numbers represent the pins on the RJ-45 on the PCs network interface card and the switch’s interface.
650.562936
There are 8, but we will only use 4, or 2 pairs, since this is a fastethernet, or 100base-t, connection.
659.328986
The first pair is at pin positions 1 and 2,
664.162833
and will connect to pins at positions 1 and 2 on the switch’s network interface.
669.743079
Although in this diagram the wires look straight, remember that in a UTP cable the pairs are twisted together,
677.328844
so in a real cable these two wires would actually be twisted together like in the photo we saw.
682.930177
The PC will use pins 1 and 2 to transmit data to the switch, which we can write as Tx.
690.940919
Because the PC is transmitting data on pins 1 and 2, the switch cannot transmit on those pins, it has to receive data which we can write as Rx, on pins 1 and 2.
704.841826
There’s an important point to remember here.
707.8437
The network interface card on a PC or server transmits data on pins 1 and 2,
713.710748
and the interfaces on a switch receive data on pins 1 and 2.
718.244926
Now, the next pair that is used in a 10BASE-T or 100-BASE-T cable is not 3 and 4.
725.769082
It’s 3 and 6.
727.319559
And, of course, the function of each pin is opposite of the pair on pins 1 and 2.
732.605887
On the switch, Pins 3 and 6 are used to transmit Data, and on the PC Pins 3 and 6 and used to receive data.
742.038064
This allows what’s called Full-Duplex transmission.
746.615893
Full-Duplex transmission means that both devices and send data at the same time,
753.867441
and no problems like collisions will occur because they use separate wires to transmit and receive data.
759.480803
Just like that, both devices send data at the same time and there are no problems.
766.486629
Let’s change the device on the left from a PC to a router.
771.03013
Just as a PC usually connects to a switch, a switch usually connects to a router.
777.493437
Once again, it’s a fastethernet, or 100BASE-T connection, so two pairs are used, 1 and 2, and 3 and 6.
785.99667
Now, which pairs on which side are used to transmit, and which are used to receive?
791.850836
Well, we know how a switch functions from the last slide.
795.561433
Pins 1 and 2 receive data, and pins 3 and 6 transmit data.
801.165916
How about a router?
803.492432
Well, the network interfaces on a router transmit and receive data on the same pairs that a PC’s network interface card does.
811.389242
A router transmits data on pins 1 and 2 And receives data on Pins 3 and 6.
818.330458
Again, Ethernet uses full-duplex transmission So the two devices can send data at the same time with no issues.
826.947233
So remember this, Routers transmit data on pins 1 and 2, and receive data on pins 3 and 6.
835.300331
This is the same as a PC.
837.86243
Once again, switches are the opposite, they receive data on pins 1 and 2 and transmit data on pins 3 and 6.
847.23494
When connecting a PC to a switch, or a Router to a switch, this works fine.
853.759357
Because they transmit and receive on opposite pin pairs, a regular cable like this works well.
860.832799
This kind of cable, by the way, is called a straight-through cable.
865.419731
Remember, a copper Ethernet cable has two RJ-45 connectors, one on each end.
872.060987
This kind of a cable is called a ‘straight through’ cable because pin 1 on one end connects straight through to pin 1 on the other end.
881.484683
Pin 2 connects to Pin 2, Pin 3 connects to Pin 3, etc.
886.808355
Now, in networks we don’t always connect PC to switch, switch to router.
892.599384
What if we want to connect a router to another router?
895.805792
Or maybe a switch to another switch?
897.971062
Or maybe connect two PCs together?
900.989343
Now I’ve replaced the switch on the right with another router.
905.676524
What will happen if the router on the left sends data to the router on the right?
910.801585
Well, it’s simply not going to work.
914.409532
The right router isn’t prepared to receive data on pins 1 and 2 of its interface,
919.295481
so communication between the two routers just doesn’t happen.
922.867401
So, how can we successfully connect two routers together?
927.287352
Or perhaps two switches, or two PCs.
930.177903
The same thing applies to connecting a PC directly to a router, also, because they both transmit data on pins 1 and 2, and receive data on pins 3 and 6.
940.575124
Let’s take a look.
941.909971
I’ve replaced the two routers with two switches, just to demonstrate that the same thing applies.
949.042408
If the switch on the left tries to transmit some data to the switch on the right it doesn’t work.
955.383065
The answer to this problem is a different type of cable.
959.784826
A straight-through cable connects pin 1 to pin 1, pin 2 to pin 2, pin 3, to pin 3, etc.
967.610751
But there’s another type of cable, called a crossover cable.
972.323747
In a crossover cable, a pin on one end of the cable doesn’t connect straight to the same pin on the other end.
979.55435
Essentially, the pairs are reversed on each end.
982.890822
So, pin 1 on one side connects to Pin 3 on the other side.
988.11111
And pin 2 on one side connects to Pin 6 on the other side.
992.577627
As you can see, the two pairs, 1 and 2, and 3 and 6, are reversed.
998.879023
Then, pair 3 on the left side will connect to Pin 1 on the right side.
1004.118783
And pin 6 on the left side will connect to pin 2 on the right side.
1008.854336
The wires are ‘crossed over’ each other, hence the name ‘crossover cable’.
1013.833333
The transmit pins on one side are connected to the receive pins on the other side,
1019.451572
so now the two devices can send data to each other with no problems.
1023.594821
Here’s another example.
1027.651816
Again, the network interface card on a PC and the network interfaces on a router both transmit data on pins 1 and 2 and receive data on pins 3 and 6,
1037.734307
however if you connect them together with a crossover cable, they will be able to exchange data with no issues.
1044.896826
Here’s a chart reviewing different device types and the pins they use to transmit and receive data
1052.682406
Routers transmit data on Pins 1 and 2, and receive data on pins 3 and 6.
1058.985214
Firewalls are the same as routers, they transmit data on Pins 1 and 2 and receive data on pins 3 and 6.
1068.2544
PCs also transmit data on Pins 1 and 2, and receive data on pins 3 and 6.
1074.912197
Switches are the only different one of the group.
1079.117694
Switches transmit data on pins 3 and 6, and receive data on pins 1 and 2.
1085.312882
Try to remember these.
1087.314283
The flashcards included in the description will help with this, so I recommend that you use them!
1092.633263
While all of that is important information to know, and can cause issues in networks even in the modern day,
1100.587877
the truth is that most modern networking devices have evolved beyond having to worry about straight-through or crossover cables.
1108.132164
That’s because newer networking devices include a feature called Auto MDI-X.
1114.861616
Previously, if two switches were connected with a straight-through cable like this, they would be unable to communicate.
1122.297893
However, Auto MDI-X allows devices to automatically detect which pins their neighbor is transmitting data on,
1130.795067
and then adjust which pins they use to transmit and receive data.
1134.328933
They can then exchange data normally.
1137.990164
So, unless you’re working with network equipment that is quite old,
1142.454949
you don’t really have to worry about straight-through and crossover cables.
1146.054576
But this is good information to be aware of, and it’s also good to learn about the concept of auto MDI-X,
1153.070599
both for the exam and for real world networking.
1155.633223
So, we’ve talked a lot about 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T,
1161.174488
but what about the higher speed copper ethernet cables?
1164.213948
Remember, I said before that for gigabit ethernet and 10 gigabit ethernet, all 8 wires are used.
1171.350173
The last two pairs are 4 and 5, and 7 and 8.
1177.71513
Again, there will be flashcards to help you remember these details.
1181.329486
It may seem like a lot to memorize, but if you use the flashcards properly its amazing how easy it is to remember all of these things.
1189.27113
Now, here’s another big difference between 1000baseT and 10GBASE-T, and 10base-t and 100-base-t.
1198.916016
In addition to using all four pairs of wires, in 1000base-T and 10Gbase-T, each pair is bidirectional,
1207.600195
meaning each pair isn’t dedicated specifically to transmitting data or receiving data.
1213.159316
This is part of the reason that they can operate at much faster speeds.
1217.553055
Okay, we’ve covered a lot about connections using copper UTP cables.
1223.427872
But there is a newer technology that is superior in many ways.
1227.449043
For example, copper UTP wiring can be used for up to 100 meters.
1232.852413
that’s usually plenty within a LAN, but how about for larger networks?
1237.365489
Look at this Cisco switch here.
1240.412293
Here it has 24 ports for RJ45 connectors.
1244.541104
These are the ports you would connect a copper UTP cable to.
1249.03348
But what about these four interfaces?
1251.865208
Take a look at this Cisco router also.
1255.271157
It only has four RJ45 ports.
1258.497274
The rest of them look like those other four ports on the switch.
1262.70123
In these interface you insert one of these
1267.345449
It’s called an SFP transceiver.
1269.886583
SFP means small form-factor pluggable.
1273.767004
So you insert one of these into the device,
1277.434831
but still things aren’t complete.
1279.705821
What kind of cable connects to one of these?
1282.663645
You connect one of these cables.
1285.38017
This is a fiber optic cable.
1287.881604
Rather than an electrical signal over copper wiring,
1291.853994
these cables send light over glass fibers.
1295.161313
Notice that there are two connectors on each end.
1298.602801
That’s because you need one connector to transmit data, and one to receive data, on each end.
1304.181239
The copper UTP cables used separate wire pairs within the cable to transmit and receive data.
1311.426319
The fiber-optic cables instead use separate cables to transmit and receive, like this.
1317.338583
Of course, ‘transmit’ on the left connects to ‘receive’ on the right, and ‘transmit’ on the right connects to ‘receive’ on the left.
1326.69035
Now let’s examine the structure of the cable itself.
1330.423759
There are four numbered parts in this diagram, from the center to the outer layer.
1335.476289
Number 1 is the fiberglass core itself.
1339.502485
Light is transmitted down this core to transmit data from one device to another.
1345.286906
Number 2 is cladding that reflects light,
1349.330217
Number 3 is a protective buffer, which protects the fiberglass from breaking
1355.409217
and number 4 is the outer jacket of the cable.
1359.675121
Now there are a couple main types of fiber-optic cables.
1363.009894
single-mode fiber, and multimode fiber.
1366.848015
Let’s check out their characteristics and differences.
1370.724314
These are two examples of multimode fiber cables.
1375.268435
The center represents the fiberglass core,
1379.067644
and the blue represents the reflective cladding that reflects light down the cable.
1383.207872
In multimode fiber cable, the core, the actual glass fiber, is wider than single mode fiber.
1391.154467
This wider core allows multiple angles, known as modes, of lightwaves to enter the fiber glass core,
1399.063135
as you can see in these two diagrams.
1401.166615
Notice the red and black lines representing light waves travelling down the fiberglass
core, 1406.87275
reflecting off the cladding at different angles.
1409.701394
Multimode fiber allows longer cables than UTP, which are limited to 100 meters,
1416.712703
but still shorter than single-mode fiber, which we will look at next.
1420.310233
Multimode fiber cables are cheaper than single-mode fiber,
1424.986932
and this is because they use cheaper transmitters, which are often LED-based.
1429.906371
This is an example of a single-mode fiber cable.
1434.299899
Again, the center represents the fiberglass core,
1437.88847
and the blue represents the reflective cadding.
1440.882413
The core diameter of a single-mode fiber cable is narrower than a multimode fiber,
1446.242165
meaning the glass fiber is thinner.
1448.444062
You can notice this in the diagram here, compared to the multimode fiber diagrams.
1453.700589
Light enters at a single angle, known as a mode, from a laser-based transmitter.
1459.711599
Notice in the diagram that the light wave travels straight down the core of the cable.
1464.930457
Single-mode fiber allows longer cable lengths than both UTP and multimode fiber cables.
1471.678992
And single-mode fiber cables are more expensive than multimode fiber cables due to the more expensive laser-based transmitters used.
1479.376837
Okay, now let’s look at some standards for fiber-optic cables like we did with UTP cables.
1485.358766
Here’s another chart like the one we looked at for copper UTP cable standards,
1491.082683
this time for fiber-optic cables.
1493.358408
First up is a standard for 1 gigabit ethernet over fiber, known as 1000BASE-LX.
1501.22133
It is defined in the IEEE 802. 3zed, or zee, standard.
1506.087595
This standard can be used over single-mode or multimode fiber cables, 1510.835005
and you can see the difference in the maximum cable lengths,
1514.038096
550 meters for multimode fiber, and 5 kilometers, or 5000 meters, for single mode fiber.
1520.831932
Next up is 10GBASE-SR, defined in the 802.3ae standard,
1528.422456
which operates at 10 gigabits per second.
1530.651711
It uses multimode fiber and can support cable lengths up to 400 meters.
1536.342691
Next is 10GBASE-LR, also defined in the 802.3ae standard,
1543.598431
again operating at 10 gigabits per second.
1546.030155
10GBASE-LR, however, uses single-mode fiber, and cables lengths can be up to 10 kilometers.
1553.898403
Finally 10GBASE-ER, also part of the 802.3ae standard, and operating at 10 gigabits per
second.
1562.889069
It supports cable lengths even longer than 10GBASE-LR, with distances up to 30 kilometers possible over a standard connection.
1571.203844
This is just a sample of fiber-optic standards, there are plenty more.
1577.075218
I will include flashcards to help you remember these standards, but to be honest I doubt you’ll be asked questions about specific details about the standards on the exam, but I don’t know for sure.
1587.911539
However, with the flashcards it’s quite easy to remember little facts like these, so I recommend not deleting those flashcards, but that’s your choice of course.
1597.204346
Finally, let’s review by comparing UTP cabling and Fiber-optic cabling, starting with UTP.
1603.269466
Copper UTP cables are cheaper than fiber-optic cables.
1608.889803
Maximum cables distances for UTP cables are shorter, about 100 meters maximum.
1615.892837
UTP cables can be vulnerable to electromagnetic interface, or EMI, 1621.907238
although the twist in the cable pairs helps to protect against this.
1625.034907
The RJ45 ports to which UTP cables connect are cheaper than the SFPs used for Fiber-optic connections
1633.282891
Also, UTP cables emit, or leak, a faint signal outside of the cable, 1640.196155
which could possibly be detected and used to copy data, posing a possible security risk.
1644.921771
Now let’s look at fiber-optic cables.
1648.018348
Fiber-optic cables are more expensive than UTP cables
1652.271247
They support longer distances than UTP cables.
1655.799843
Their SFP ports are more expensive than RJ45 ports,
1660.698679
and single-mode fiber ports are more expensive than multimode.
1664.5181
They do not emit any signal outisde of the cable,
1668.369367
so there is no security risk there.
1670.324435
Okay, so we covered a lot of information, but I want to remind you of the supplementary materials for the video that will help you remember what you learned.
1681.037031
Like in the last video, there will be an end-of-video quiz starting from the next slide.
1687.445442
Also, I have made a deck of flashcards to help you review the information covered in this video,
1693.627336
check the link in the description to download them.
1696.184215
And there will also be a practice lab using Packet Tracer,
1700.912951
which will be released as a separate video.
1703.126392
Okay, let’s get started with the quiz.
1705.836664
Quiz question 1.
1708.798853
You connect two old routers together with a UTP cable,
1712.846453
however data is not successfully sent and received between them.
1716.600061
What could be the problem?
1719.503605
A, they are connected with a straight-through cable.
1722.994469
B, they are connected with a crossover cable.
1726.92765
or C, they are operating in auto MDI-x mode.
1731.930566
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1735.449836
The answer is A, they are connected with a straight-through cable.
1742.316022
let’s check each of the possible answers.
1745.591236
A crossover cable is not the issue.
1749.311633
In fact, a crossover cable would likely fix the issue.
1752.527839
Because both routers transmit data on pins 1 and 2, a crossover cable is necessary to properly connect the transmit pins on one side to the receive pins (3 and 6) on the other side.
1765.06218
Modern devices with Auto MDI-X enabled don’t have this issue, but it is possible that the old routers do not have Auto MDI-X.
1773.7878
So, b, they are connected with a crossover cable, is incorrect.
1778.42047
Auto MDI-X allows devices to detect which pins and wires their neighbors are using to transmit and receive data,
1786.075713
and adjust their own operations to match.
1788.799953
Actually, Auto MDI-X would likely fix this issue,
1793.032126
but since the routers are old they might not have the Auto MDI-X function.
1797.921085
So, c, They are operating in Auto MDI-X mode, is incorrect.
1803.038497
On old devices without Auto MDI-X, a straight-through cable cannot be used to connect devices of the same type.
1810.872574
A crossover cable is necessary.
1813.316993
So a, they are connected with a straight-through cable, is the best answer.
1818.177058
Quiz question 2.
1821.529326
Your company wants to connect switches in two separate buildings that are about 150 meters apart.
1828.236322
They want to keep costs down, if possible.
1831.568155
What kind of cable should they use?
1833.787182
A, UTP. B, Single-mode fiber, or C, multimode fiber.
1842.363014
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1845.56317
The answer is C, multimode fiber.
1852.532756
Let’s check.
1854.116788
Although UTP would keep the costs down, it does not support distances over 100 meters.
1860.574868
So A, UTP, is incorrect.
1864.019885
Although single-mode fiber supports distances much longer than 150 meters, 1870.071855
it is more expensive than multimode fiber.
1873.350407
So b, single-mode fiber, is not the best answer.
1877.383541
Multimode fiber supports distances over 150 meters and is less expensive than single-mode fiber.
1885.958353
So C, multimode fiber, is the best answer.
1888.988714
Let’s go on to question 3.
1891.626251
Your company wants to connect two offices that are about 3 kilometers apart.
1897.048516
They want to keep costs down if possible.
1900.008581
Which kind of cable should they use?
1902.685128
A, UTP, B, single-mode fiber, or C, multimode fiber.
1911.527004
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1916.684361
The answer is b, single-mode fiber.
1921.6202
Let’s check the answers.
1923.76969
Although UTP keeps costs down, it does not support distances of 3 kilometers.
1929.83698
So A, UTP, is incorrect.
1933.305177
Although multimode fiber is cheaper than single-mode fiber, it also does not support distances of 3 kilometers.
1940.364079
So c, multimode fiber, is incorrect.
1944.23003
Many single-mode fiber standards support cable lengths much longer than 3 kilometers.
1950.175206
Although single-mode fiber is more expensive than the other options, it is necessary in this case.
1957.43531
So B, multi-mode fiber, is the best answer.
1960.663351
A switch has the following indication over its network interfaces: What would happen if you connect it to an identical switch with a straight-through cable?
1972.460395
A, they would operate normally.
1975.506955
B, they would operate at a reduced speed.
1979.911809
or C, they would be unable to communicate.
1983.79415
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1987.189564
The answer is a, they would operate normally.
1994.131133
Let’s check.
1995.781291
They would not operate at a reduced speed.
1998.99011
The ports are Auto MDI-X enabled.
2001.75389
However, even if they didn’t have Auto MDI-X, they wouldn’t operate at a reduced speed.
2007.734104
They simply wouldn’t operate.
2010.162212
So b, they would operate at a reduced speed, is incorrect.
2014.688631
Because the ports are Auto MDI-X enabled, they would be able to communicate, even though they are connected with a straight-through cable.
2023.280321
So c, they would be unable to communicate, is incorrect.
2027.528978
Because the ports are Auto MDI-X enabled, they would operate normally, regardless of whether they are connected with a straight-through or a crossover cable.
2038.114255
So a, they would operate normally, is the correct answer.
2042.053761
Let’s go to the final quiz question for this video.
2046.540939
Your company needs to connect many end hosts to a switch which is in a wiring cabinet on the same office floor as the hosts.
2054.678353
What kind of cable should they use?
2057.263631
a, UTP. b, single-mode fiber, or C, multimode fiber.
2065.962909
Pause the video to think about your answer.
2069.168937
The answer is a, UTP.
2075.188079
Let’s check the answers.
2076.685279
Most hosts do not have the capability to connect to a switch via fiber cabling,
2082.61855
and most switches do not have enough SFP interfaces to support many hosts.
2087.89333
So b, single-mode fiber, and c, multimode fiber, are inorrect.
2093.206373
UTP cables are the standard for wired connections to switches.
2097.944341
Switches typically have many RJ45 ports for end hosts to connect to,
2103.506647
and end hosts will have an RJ45 port on their network interface card to connect a UTP cable to.
2110.239443
So a, UTP, is the correct answer.
2113.918639
