studying for the CCNA  22.503468 in this lab we
will configure H SRP 27.171064  the hot standby
router protocol  29.784624 H SRP is an example of
an F H R P  34.916824 a first hop redundancy
protocol  37.130407 H SRP is a cisco proprietary
protocol by the way  41.734670 so it operates only
on cisco equipment 45.197481  vrrp virtual router
redundancy protocol is a vendor neutral
standard similar to HSR P 53.254647  redundancy is
important in a network because failures
can occur  58.791654 and redundancy can prevent
service outages if a failure occurs
somewhere in the network 63.705780  in this network
for example  66.901562 we will configure pcs in
VLAN 10 69.900519  to use R 1 as their default
gateway  72.392787 but in the event that our one
fails pcs will automatically transition
to using R 2  78.599793 which is functioning as the
standby router as their default gateway 82.703172 
now this means that one router will be
inactive until the other fails 87.867662  which is
a waste of bandwidth 89.901154  however we can
achieve load balancing by assigning
different default gateways for different
VLANs 96.045371  in this network well as I said
before VLAN 10 will use R 1 as the
active router  102.571606 and R 2 as the standby  104.657139 we
will configure VLAN 20 to use R 2 as the
active router 108.506595  and R 1 as the standby
 110.617751 let's get started 112.487048  let's start with our
ones configuration  116.188113 enable
call T H SRP is configured at the
interface level  125.213102 let's start with G 0 1 127.089020 
interface G 0 1 130.016118  H SRP is configured with
the command
standby 134.524077  followed by a group number 136.535460  I'll
use 10 since this will be the default
gateway for VLAN 10  141.017524 then type IP
followed by the virtual IP address 147.041038  this
is an IP address which isn't necessarily
assigned to a physical interface on
either router 154.027138  but the PCs have been
configured to use it as their default
gateway  158.034462 so when the PCs send an ARP
request for the virtual IP  163.308726 whichever
router is the active router will reply
with its own MAC address 168.208952  so pcs will
send traffic to that router 171.202127  our our
instructions say to use 10.10 10.1 as
the default gateway for VLAN 10  177.683737 so 10
dot N Da 10.1 180.707637  now we want to ensure that
our 1 will be the active router  184.837138 so let's
increase the priority  186.528929 

first what's the
default priority  189.673560 you can check with this
command  192.226456 do show standby  194.320414 so it's priority
100 197.983580  which is the default  199.670580 let's increase
the priority for a standby group 10 202.752163 
standby 10 priority 205.545996  and let's increase
it to 110 208.517725  another part of our
instructions is to use HS RP version 2 214.370079 
which offers some minor improvements
over a version 1  217.537058 standby version 2  220.594787 as
you may have noticed standby version 2
doesn't include the group number 224.943474  it
applies to all standby groups on the
interface  228.175183 ok finally let's enable
preemption  231.792245 well what is preemption  234.159203 if r1
fails
r2 will become the active router for
VLAN 10  239.582057 if preemption is disabled 242.633807  even
if r1 recovers  244.736077 it won't become the
active router again  246.472119 if preemption is
enabled however  249.632306 hour 1 will become
active again when it recovers 252.936493  here's the
command  254.896201 standby 10 preempt 257.972118  ok that's all
for our ones G 0 1 interface  261.820951 instead of
finishing the configuration on r1 266.861472  let
to Artoo's VLAN 10 configuration 268.844804  and
then test it  270.661221 enable Conti 275.437782  r2 will use
the GZ ur to interface 278.743907  so interface g0 - 280.692511 
all we have to do for r2 is standby
version 2 286.227136  and standby 10 IP 10 10 10 1 291.218095 
that's it  293.061386 we don't need to configure
preemption here  295.169907 we only need to
configure it on the active router 298.358053  we
also don't need to change the priority
 301.236073 since we already made our ones higher
okay let's go on pc-12 test first I'll
see if I can ping the virtual IP of 10
10 10 1 ping 10 10 10 1 ok it works now
let's try to ping the external server at
1500 one ping 1500 1 ok it works too
now let's confirm the path being taken
traceroute 1500 1 as you can see
traceroute shows our ones IP address not
the virtual IP address so you can use it
to confirm the path let's go do a reload
on our one and see if r2 takes over and
reload
okay let's go on r2 and check if it took
over for r1 do show standby as you can
see our two is now active let's quickly
try that traceroute from pc1 again
traceroute 1500 1 now you can see it
goes via r2 at 10 10 10 3 now r1 is in
the process of booting up however when
it finishes it should take over again as
the active router since we configure
preemption I'll just wait for another 10
seconds or so and then go check
okay hopefully that's enough time let's
go on our one in check an able show
standby there are one is the active
router once again let's trace route one
last time from pc1 trace route 1500 1
now it's going via our one again not our
two
so the configuration for VLAN 10 is
complete now let's configure the
opposite set up for VLAN 20 r2 should be
the active router with our one as backup
or standby I'll configure the active r2
first interface g0 one
standby version to standby 20 I P 10 20
21
standby 20 preempt just to make things
different
I won't increase the priority on the
active let's decrease the priority on
the standby instead so that's all for
our two let's go to our one coffee tea
interface g0 to standby version to
standby 20 I P 10 20 21
standby 20 priority 90 okay that's all
give them some time to talk with each
other and figure things out but soon r2
should become the active and r1 the
stand by for VLAN 20 let's try a ping
from PC three first I'll try to ping the
virtual router to make sure ping 10 20
21 okay we can reach it now let's try to
ping out to the external server ping
1500 1
okay it's reachable so now let's check
the path it's taking traceroute 1501 as
you can see it's going via r2 at 10.20
22 let's test the failover again I'll
reload our to end reload okay let's give
our one a few seconds to take its role
as active for VLAN 20 ok let's try let's
hop back on PC 3 and traceroute again
traceroute 1500 1 great the failover
worked and the ping is now going via r1
at 10.20 23 this time let's wait another
10 seconds or so for r2 to come back
online and take over once again as the
active router
okay hopefully that's enough time let's
give that traceroute one more try here
on PC three traceroute 1500 one alright
now it's back to using R 2 as the
gateway in this lab we configured HS RP
and also showed how you can configure
load balancing by configuring different
active routers for different VLANs
