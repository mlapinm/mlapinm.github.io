28.632009
Let’s get started.
30.430474
This third lesson is about two networking models.
34.904531
The first is the OSI Model, and the second is the TCP/IP suite.
42.013785
Note that the TCP/IP suite is a networking model, too,
46.952923
but it’s usually referred to as the TCP/IP suite, or just TCP/IP.
51.671869
Unless you’re familiar with networking, you probably haven’t heard of the OSI model.
58.392249
However, you probably have heard of TCP/IP, or at least the second part of that name, IP, the Internet Protocol,
66.646118
for example you’ve probably heard of an IP address before.
69.496566
So, what is a networking model?
73.663709
Well, networking models categorize and provide a structure for networking protocols and standards.
80.6646
Do you remember what a networking protocol is?
83.949991
I talked a bit about Ethernet, and various standards for copper and fiber-optic cables in the Day 2 video.
91.665797
That’s an example of a protocol.
93.508084
A networking protocol is a set of rules defining how network devices and software should work,
100.309544
including how they should work together.
102.536079
By the way, protocols refer to logical rules about how devices should communicate, not physical standards.
109.519622
So, you could visualize it like this.
113.394843
This is a networking model, and it categorizes and provides a structure for various networking protocols like these.
120.367373
The different colors represent different categories of protocols and standards.
125.358728
These protocols and standards could define something like the structure and usage of IP addresses, or maybe physical details like electrical voltage used on copper cables when transmitting data.
137.69387
Let’s talk about the OSI model first,
140.332397
and then we’ll look at the TCP/IP suite after.
143.924456
So, what if there were no standard networking models and protocols?
149.012565
Here’s a few Dell PCs and a few iMacs.
154.254918
If Dell and Apple each made their own networking model, each with their own set of networking protocols,
160.829856
these Dells would be able to communicate with each other,
164.446014
and these iMacs would be able to communicate with each other,
167.497563
but because the Dells and iMacs would speak a different language than each other,
171.413033
with a different set of rules about how to communicate,
174.544244
the Dells wouldn’t be able to communicate with the imacs.
177.328449
This is obviously a problem in modern networks, such as the Internet,
182.170668
where we expect devices from various makers in various countries to be able to communicate with each other.
188.239103
The OSI model is one attempt at standardizing network communications.
192.863807
Although it isn’t actually in use today,
196.618928
it has had a big impact on how network engineers think about networking,
199.769406
and we still refer to it today.
202.041075
OSI stands for ‘open systems interconnection’ model.
207.788404
Open, means that it is an open standard,
211.41468
not a proprietary model developed and used by an individual company.
214.963722
It is a conceptual model that categorizes and standardizes the different functions in a network.
221.492664
It was created by the international organization for standardization, the ISO, in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
230.331221
Network functions are divided into 7 layers.
234.478659
For example, look at the bottom Layer, layer 1.
238.178262
It is the physical layer.
240.267977
The standards for cables and interfaces we learned about in the Day 2 video
244.509937
all fit into the physical layer of the OSI model,
247.768962
but there are 6 more layers on top of that to make the network operate properly.
253.130121
Let’s examine each layer one by one, starting at Layer 7, the application layer.
259.096082
The application layer is the layer that is closest to the end user.
264.857148
The application layer interacts with software applications that have some communication component,
271.167367
such as your web browser, whether that’s Brave, Firefox, Chrome, or whatever.
275.673554
For example HTTP and HTTPS are Layer 7 protocols.
281.981466
Notice https before cisco. com,
286.621696
indicating that https is being used to get this website and view it in the browser.
292.289946
Keep in mind that Layer 7 doesn’t include the application itself,
296.65293
like Chrome or Firefox, but rather the protocols that interact with the application, like HTTP or HTTPs.
304.831921
A couple functions of Layer 7 are: identifying communication partners and synchronizing communication.
313.759217
Let me explain how it does this.
316.448988
Here I have two OSI model stacks,
320.613954
representing two computers that will communicate with eachother.
323.857865
The software application, maybe a web browser, interacts with Layer 7, the application layer,
330.200659
and wants to send some data to the system on the right.
333.456373
This data is processed through the OSI stack,
337.385993
each layer adding something to the original data.
340.423208
This is called ‘ENCAPSULATION’, because the original data is encapsulated inside this additional information which is added on.
349.211982
By the time it reaches the physical layer, it is electrical signals on a wire, and is sent to the neighboring system.
356.920796
Then, the neighboring system performs the opposite process, the additions of each layer are stripped off until the data reaches the application layer of the neighboring system.
367.739577
This process is called ‘de-encapsulation’,
371.463682
as the additional information is removed as the data is processed up the stack.
376.22687
Both the encapsulation and de-encapsulation processes are examples of ‘Adjacent-layer interaction’,
383.793592
interaction between the different layers of the OSI model.
386.650643
However, the communication between the application layers of the two different systems, is called same-layer interaction.
394.301916
This same-layer interaction between application Layers is what allows the application layer to perform its functions of identifying communication partners, synchronizing communications, etc.
406.529278
Layer 6 of the OSI is the presentation layer.
411.758803
Data in the application is in an ‘application format’, a format that applications understand.
418.920638
It needs to be translated to a different format to be sent over the network.
423.158249
the presentation layer’s job is to translate between application and network formats.
428.82591
One example of a function of the presentation layer is encryption of data as it is sent,
434.77632
so that only the intended recipient can read it,
437.183822
and of course decryption as it is received.
440.556855
The presentation layer also translates between different application-layer formats,
445.761551
to ensure that the data is in a format the receiving host can understand.
449.870117
To summarize, the presentation layer translates data to the appropriate format.
455.096307
That’s all you really need to know about the presentation layer.
458.730004
Layer 5 of the OSI model is the session layer.
463.391275
The session layer controls dialogues, also known as sessions, between communicating hosts.
469.769525
It establishes, manages, and terminates connections between the local application (for example your web browser)
476.759748
and the remote application, for example, YouTube.
480.232957
YouTube’s servers are being used by countless people at every moment,
484.909203
and there has to be a way to manage all of these sessions.
487.856197
That’s the purpose of the session layer of the OSI model.
491.14752
So, we’ve looked at the top 3 layers of the OSI model.
496.382581
From Top to bottom, application, presentation, and session.
501.862093
It’s important to know what the functions of these layers are,
506.016326
but actually network engineers don’t really work with these layers of the OSI model.
510.920719
That is the job of application developers.
514.043222
Application developers work with the top layers of the OSI model to connect their applications over networks.
521.107693
Let’s return to this diagram.
524.942375
Remember what I said about encapsulation?
527.172206
Well, data prepared at the top 3 layers is then sent over to the bottom 4 layers,
533.884501
which actually do the work of sending it over the network.
536.907379
After the top 3 layers hand data over to the bottom 4 layers,
542.067816
The next step before sending data is that Layer 4,
545.945846
the transport layer, adds a header in front of the data, like this.
549.731835
So, let’s look into the Transport layer a little bit.
553.690564
Layer 4 of the OSI model is the transport layer.
558.682636
It segments and reassembles data for communications between end hosts.
564.237927
To reword that, it breaks large pieces of data into smaller segments which can be easily sent over the network and are less likely to cause transmission problems if errors occur.
576.022372
For example, if data wasn’t segmented and you were trying to watch a video,
581.798862
if an error occurred that prevented the video from reaching your computer,
586.100514
you wouldn’t be able to watch the video at all.
588.431931
However, if the data is segmented into many small units,
592.898696
and only one fails to reach the destination,
595.932927
that’s not a big problem.
597.084232
The video might skip for a second,
599.730835
but then will continue on just fine.
601.928803
Also, the Transport layer provides host-to-host communication,
606.896792
also known as end-to-end communication.
610.006452
This also provides process-to-process communications for applications.
614.492678
Now let’s review.
617.760266
Data is prepared by the top 3 layers.
621.067813
a Layer 4 header is added on.
624.077412
Note that at this point in the process, this unit of data plus Layer 4 header is called a segment.
631.504842
Remember, if the data being sent is large enough,
635.795076
it will actually be segmented into smaller parts,
638.007011
and a Layer 4 header will be added on to each segment.
641.910759
Next, that segment is passed on to Layer 3.
645.75048
And another header is added on to the end, like this.
649.213537
Layer 3 of the OSI model is the Network Layer.
654.169223
The network layer provides connectivity between end hosts on different networks,
659.420908
for example outside of the local area network, or LAN,
663.102207
which we mentioned briefly in the Day 1 video.
665.943294
Layer 3 provides logical addressing, in the form of IP addresses, something you’ve probably heard of before.
674.016342
Layer 3 also provides path selection between source and destination.
679.858147
Often there are many possible paths which data can take to reach its destination,
685.56455
especially over a huge network like the Internet.
688.163547
Layer 3 provides the means of selecting the best path.
693.159016
Routers operate at Layer 3.
695.753721
Remember in Day 1’s video I said that routers are used when end hosts need to reach a destination outside of their LAN?
703.077148
That’s because routers are Layer 3 devices.
706.02994
Let’s review the encapsulation process again.
710.409882
Data is prepared by the upper layers,
713.66807
the transport layer adds a layer 4 header, and this combination of data plus layer 4 header is called a segment.
721.628973
next the network layer adds a layer 3 header, including information like the source and destination IP address, to the segment.
730.260123
This combination of data, layer 4 header, and layer 3 header, is called a packet.
737.898421
Next, the packet is further encapsulated at Layer 2,
742.109435
this time with both a Layer 2 header AND a Layer 2 trailer.
746.83914
Layer 2 of the OSI model is the Data Link Layer.
751.653858
The data link layer provides node-to-node connectivity and data transfer.
757.105726
For example, direct connections between a PC and a switch, or a switch and a router, or a router and a router.
765.859375
because Layer 2 is adjacent to Layer 1, the physical layer, it also defines how data is formatted for transmission over a physical medium, like copper UTP cables.
777.024277
Layer 2 also detects, and possibly corrects, errors that occur on the physical layer.
783.877072
Like layer 3, layer 2 also uses an addressing system, 789.416241
however it is separate and different from layer 3 addressing.
793.305959
Finally, switches operate at Layer 2.
797.548657
Switches look at the destination Layer 2 address to determine where to send the data,
803.288101
Let’s look at the encapsulation process once more.
807.797307
Data is prepared by the application layer.
810.950096
A layer 4 header is added to the data to make a segment.
815.575676
A Layer 3 header is added to the segment to make a packet.
819.949364
Remember, the IP address is included in this Layer 3 header.
824.373801
Then, a layer 2 header and layer 2 trailer are added to the packet.
829.928848
At this point, the combination of data, layer 4 header, layer 3 header, layer 2 header and layer 2 trailer is called a frame.
840.679247
Now, the data is not further encapsulated at Layer 1.
845.101284
This frame is then sent over the connection, whether it’s electrical signals over a wire or wireless signals in the case of wifi, to the neighboring system.
855.751843
Let’s look at layer 1 of the OSI model a bit before moving on.
860.077559
Layer 1 of the OSI model is the physical layer.
864.349199
The physical layer defines physical characteristics of the medium used to transfer data between devices.
871.442464
For example, voltage levels, maximum transmission distances, like the maximum cable lengths mentioned in Day 2’s video, physical connectors, cable specifications, etc.
884.903775
Digital bits are converted into electrical signals, for wired connections, or radio signals, for wireless connections, like Wi-Fi.
894.727022
as I mentioned before, all of the information in Day 2’s video, such as cables and pin layouts, is related to the physical layer of the OSI model.
904.975917
Okay, now we’ve got a complete frame,
909.724888
and that frame will be sent from the local device over this cable,
913.006065
let’s say its an ethernet cable.
914.921034
Once it reaches the remote device, the reverse process of encapsulation, de-encapsualtion, takes place.
923.581047
the data link layer translates the raw physical data into a complete frame once again.
929.440983
Then the layer 2 header and trailer are removed, leaving the Layer 3 packet.
935.140714
The layer 3 header is removed, leaving the Layer 4 segment.
940.035346
Finally, the layer 4 header is removed and we are left with the original data prepared by the upper layers of the original device.
948.983125
That’s the process of de-encapsulation.
951.428689
Before moving on, I want to review some terms.
955.815555
So, when an application wants to send data to another system,
961.380866
it interacts with the application layer of the OSI stack and the data is prepared to be sent.
967.142811
When the layer 4 header is added at the transport layer,
970.750638
what is this combination of data plus Layer 4 header called?
974.479911
It’s called a Segment.
977.443889
Then, the Layer 3 header is added on at the Network layer, 981.710615
remember that includes the IP address.
984.174307
What’s this now called?
985.867831
It’s called a packet.
988.456639
Finally, a Layer 2 header and trailer are added at the Data Link layer.
993.279718
What’s this complete unit called?
996.230787
It’s called a frame.
998.057846
Now, there is one new term that is used to refer to all of these.
1002.864585
These are all called Protocol Data Units, or PDUs.
1007.149517
For example, segment is the term for a Layer 4 PDU,
1012.327432
Packet is the term for a Layer 3 PDU, etc.
1015.316946
By the way, at Layer 1, the physical layer,
1019.9335
the name for the PDU is bit,
1022.085009
referring to the bits being transferred on the wire.
1025.100968
So, that’s a lot of information.
1028.743282
If you need help remembering the order of the OSI model layers, the flashcards included in the description should be a big help,
1036.320507
but here are a couple acronyms too.
1039.153156
I don’t use acronyms to remember things myself, but many people like them,
1044.180187
so here are a few examples to help you remember.
1047.04345
The first one goes from layer 7 to layer 1,
1050.922278
ALL PEOPLE SEEM TO NEED DATA PROCESSING.
1055.895456
Here’s another one, from Layer 1 to Layer 7 this time.
1060.113784
PLEASE DO NOT TEACH STUDENTS POINTLESS ACRONYMS.
1066.076113
If you know any other good ones post them in the comment section!
1070.803287
Now let’s move on from the OSI model, to the TCP/IP suite.
1077.150196
Like the OSI model, it is a conceptual model and set of communications protocols,
1083.369313
and in TCP/IPs case it is used in the Internet and other networks.
1088.414615
It is known as TCP/IP because those are two of the foundational protocols in the suite.
1094.602101
It was developed by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA,
1099.840965
which is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
1103.219918
It has a similar structure to the OSI model, but with fewer layers.
1108.223063
And, it is the model actually in use in modern networks, NOT OSI.
1114.301119
Note, however, that the OSI model still influences how network engineers think and talk about networks today, which is why it's important to learn.
1123.947393
Now let’s compare the two.
1126.942795
On the left is the OSI model you’re familiar with by now, 1130.689415
and on the right is the TCP/IP Suite’s networking model.
1135.06291
The Application, Presentation, and Session layers of the OSI model are essentially equivalent to the Application Layer of the TCP/IP model.
1145.296047
Combining them into one actually represents how network engineers tend to think about networks,
1151.615025
since we don’t work much with anything above the Transport Layer,
1155.364078
however, when TALKING about networks, we use the OSI numbering.
1160.388598
For example, if you say ‘there is a Layer 4 problem in the network’,
1164.542439
network engineers will think of OSI’s Layer 4, the transport layer,
1169.934961
not TCP/IP’s Layer 4, the Application Layer.
1173.495192
Moving on, the OSI model and the TCP/IP model both share the transport layer.
1179.957563
The network layer of the OSI model maps to the Internet layer of the TCP/IP model.
1186.825996
Finally, the data link and Physical layers of the OSI model are equivalent to the Link layer of the TPC/IP model.
1196.028944
Once again, though, if people say, for example, there is a Layer 2 problem in the network,
1201.928194
they are referring to the OSI Model’s Layer 2, the Data Link Layer,
1206.806713
not TCP/IP’s layer 2, the Internet layer.
1210.330181
Keep that in mind.
1212.476453
Although TCP/IP is the model actually in use in modern day networks,
1217.985911
we still talk about networks using the OSI model language.
1221.499822
Now, you might hear different names used for these layers.
1226.133834
This is a chart off of Wikipedia showing different naming systems used.
1231.234085
Don’t worry about memorizing all of these,
1234.967708
but just keep in mind you might here different names than the ones I taught you.
1239.096397
For example, the Link layer might be called the network interface, or network access layer.
1245.952496
I actually like this 5 layer model, because it combines the top 3 layers that we, network engineers, don’t really think about into one,
1254.910677
but it keeps the data link and physical layers separate,
1258.771487
and I think its good to think of them as two separate layers.
1262.511278
Before finishing up this lesson and moving on to the quiz,
1266.005044
I want to show you this excellent diagram which I found on Wikipedia.
1270.05311
It demonstrates the process of a host, Host A, sending data to Host B, with two routers in between.
1277.649672
Here you see the four devices, Host A, connected to a router, connected to another router, connected to Host B.
1287.18286
Here is the TCP/IP stack on each device.
1292.053245
Note that, for forwarding data from host to host,
1296.559378
these routers don’t need to be aware of the higher layers,
1299.60203
so only the Internet and Link layers are present here.
1302.943546
So, let’s walk through the process.
1306.006335
An application on Host A wants to communicate with an application on Host B.
1311.994274
Let’s say it’s a Skype conversation,
1315.372101
so Host A is sending a little bit of video and audio data to Host B.
1320.039923
Skype interacts with the application Layer,
1323.844095 and the data is encapsulated via the
Transport, Internet, and Link Layers.
1329.392453
Then, it is forwarded over to the Router,
1333.135054
probably via Ethernet UTP copper cabling.
1336.026202
Remember, Routers are Layer 3 devices,
1339.819894
so they want to know the Layer 3 IP address to know where to forward the data next.
1344.897998
So, de-encapsulation occurs at the Link layer,
1349.023
and then at the Internet layer the router looks at the destination IP address to know where to send the packet.
1355.69874
Then, the packet is once again encapsulated to make a Frame.
1360.537077
From here it is sent to another router, perhaps over long-distance fiber cabling.
1366.289212
At the Link Layer of this second router, de-encapsulation occurs again,
1371.618064
and this router also checks the destination IP address.
1375.218108
Once it knows where to send the packet,
1378.305712
it is once again encapsulated,
1380.719614
and sent over some medium, Ethernet cabling in this case, to Host B.
1385.107373
Now de-encapsulation takes place once more.
1389.380479
Here at the link layer it is a frame.
1392.396854
The header and trailer are removed, and it becomes a packet.
1397.171776
The header is removed, and it becomes a segment.
1401.337862
Finally, the transport layer header is removed, and the application layer on Host B receives the data and interacts with the application on Host B.
1411.634434
So, this has achieved process-to-process communication, between Skype on Host A and Skype on Host B.
1419.463691
Of course, this process will happen many many times in both directions during the duration of a skype call.
1426.310029
As I mentioned before, this is known as same-layer interaction.
1431.985274
Also, I mentioned the transport layer providers host-to-host communications before.
1438.234424
This diagram indicates that as well.
1440.656163
This Transport layer segment was never changed during this whole process,
1446.194675
it is as if it's direct communication between the two hosts.
1450.087085
Finally, remember that, because the TCP/IP protocols are all industry standard protocols used by all makers,
1459.072835
it doesn’t matter what kind of PCs or router you’re using.
1462.195567
An Apple iMac can communicate with a Cisco router, which can communicate with a Juniper router, which can communicate with a Dell PC.
1471.957623
That’s the importance of having industry standards.
1475.190629
Okay, that was another lesson with a lot of information.
1480.41953
Once again, there will be supplementary materials to help you remember everything.
1485.838174
There will, of course, be an end-of-video quiz, coming up from the next slide.
1490.769031
There will also be pre-made flash cards to help you memorize what you need to remember,
1495.570299
check the link in the description.
1497.242878
Finally, for this video I will again include a Packet Tracer practice lab,
1502.535588
which will use an interesting feature of packet tracer called ‘simulation mode’ to analyze network traffic.
1508.695222
Now let’s go to the quiz.
1510.577458
HTTP data sent from a YouTube web server is displayed via your web browser.
1518.631
This is an example of what?
1520.86638
A, adjacent-layer interaction.
1524.551738
B, same-layer interaction.
1527.740088
C, encapsulation.
1531.079787
Or D, de-encapsulation.
1534.076382
Pause the video to think about your answer...
1538.138407
the answer is B, same-layer interaction.
1545.437509
Let’s check the options.
1547.62281
Adjacent-layer interaction refers to interaction between different layers of the OSI model.
1554.329754
In this case, both YouTube’s web server and your web browser are operating at Layer 7 using HTTP.
1562.640121
So A, adjacent-layer interaction, is incorrect.
1567.319123
Although encapsulation and de-encapsulation of data surely happened many times as the data was sent from YouTube’s web server to your web browser,
1576.866452
they are not descriptions of the interaction between YouTube and your browser.
1580.8732
So c, encapsulation, and d, de-encapsulation, are incorrect.
1586.799466
Same-layer interaction refers to interaction between the same layer on different hosts,
1593.976929
in this case the application layer of YouTube’s web server and the browser on your PC.
1599.084313
The concept of same-layer interaction allows you to ‘ignore’ the other layers involved
1605.106639
and focus on interactions between a single layer on different devices.
1609.615585
So b, same-layer interaction, is the correct answer.
1613.755706
let’s go to question 2.
1615.515498
HTTP data has been encapsulated with three separate headers and one trailer.
1622.732672
What is the appropriate name for this PDU?
1625.449526
A, packet.
1628.420497
B, segment.
1630.825891
C, frame.
1633.32757
Or D, data.
1635.773962
Pause the video to think about your answer...
1638.582354
The answer is C, Frame.
1645.031334
Let’s check.
1646.808508
Packet refers to the OSI Layer 3 PDU.
1651.761876
It would have two headers (the Layer 4 header, and the Layer 3 header) and no trailer.
1658.092796
So a, packet, is incorrect.
1661.097869
Segment refers to the OSI Layer 4 PDU.
1665.61893
It would have one header (the Layer 4 header), and no trailer.
1670.335324
So b, segment, is incorrect.
1673.505533
Data refers to the upper-layer data before being encapsulated.
1679.177694
It would have no headers or trailer.
1681.583148
So d, data, is incorrect.
1685.160053
Frame refers to the OSI Layer 2 PDU.
1689.378102
It has three headers (Layer 4, Layer 3, and Layer 2 headers) and one trailer (the Layer 2 trailer).
1697.380498
So c, frame, is the correct answer.
1701.182188
Let’s go to question 3.
1703.190039
Which layers of the OSI model are most relevant to the role of a network engineer?
1710.232683
A, transport, network, data link, and physical.
1715.485533
B, transport, network, and data link.
1720.025773
C, network only, or D, applicaton, presentation, and session.
1727.481794
Pause the video to think about your answer...
1730.062857
the answer is A, transport, network, data-link, and physical.
1739.935763
Let’s check.
1740.860007
Although these layers are very relevant to the duties of a network engineer, the physical layer is missing.
1747.937707
So b, transport, network, and data link, is incorrect.
1753.161665
Although the Network layer is very relevant to network engineers of course , it is not the only one.
1759.684237
So c, network only, is incorrect.
1763.110122
These layers of the OSI model are not generally relevant to the role of a network engineer.
1769.977562
They are relevant to application developers.
1773.278278
So D, application, presentation, and session, is incorrect.
1777.999937
These four lower layers of the OSI models are all very relevant to the role of a network engineer.
1786.170888
So a, transport, network, data link, and physical, is the correct answer.
1792.729815
Lets go to the next question.
1795.163932
The Link layer of the TCP/IP Model is equivalent to what layer, or layers, of the OSI Model?
1803.902824
A, transport and network.
1807.21133
B, network and data link.
1810.258541
C, data link.
1816.068186
Or D, data link and physical.
1819.00967
Pause the video to think about your answer...
1818.735807
the correct answer is D, data link and physical.
1826.190794
Let’s check.
1827.619981
The OSI Transport layer is equivalent to the TCP/IP Transport layer,
1833.690044
and the OSI Network layer is equivalent to the TCP/IP Internet layer.
1838.259235
So a, transport and network layers, is incorrect.
1842.650433
The OSI Network layer is equivalent to the TCP/IP Internet layer.
1849.167841
The OSI Data Link layer is equivalent to part of the TCP/IP Link layer, but it is not totally equivalent.
1857.087853
So b, network and data link layers, and c, data link layer, are incorrect.
1863.269242
The combined functions of the OSI Data Link and Physical layers are equivalent to the TCP/IP Link layer.
1871.29635
So d, data link and physical layers, is the correct answer.
1876.263994
Let’s go to the last quiz question for this video.
1879.756819
Which layer of the OSI model provides host-to-host communications?
1884.54002
A, application, b, network, c, transport, or d, data link.
1893.246146
Pause the video to think about your answer...
1896.804753
the answer is c, transport.
1902.637167
Let’s check.
1903.782528
The Application layer provides process-to-process communications, not host-to-host.
1910.416785
So a, application layer, is incorrect.
1914.328322
The Network and Data Link layers do not provide end-to-end, host-to-host communications.
1921.426748
So b, network, and d, data link, are incorrect.
1926.32661
The Transport layer provides host-to-host communications, as shown in this diagram.
1932.73919
So c, Transport, is the correct answer.
1936.926916
