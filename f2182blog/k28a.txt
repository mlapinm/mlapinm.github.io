welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab you can download the lab

file from the link in the description if

you like these labs please consider

supporting me via my patreon where the

cryptocurrency options in the

description in this lab we will

configure rip version 2 on a network to

allow full connectivity this is similar

network to the static routing part to

lab in that lab we had to configure full

connectivity with static routes this lab

will demonstrate how much simpler it is

to do so with the routing protocol I

have increased the font size of the CLI

in the network diagram due to some

comments let me know if the size is good

or if it's still difficult to see in the

video so currently the devices have all

been pre-configured with IP addresses

but none of the PC should be able to pin

each other because no routing has been

configured let's configure rip version 2

on each of these routers on r1 first

enable compte router rip first I'll

enable a version 2 version 2 it's not

necessary for this lab but I'll also

disable auto summary which is a good

habit no auto our one is connected to 3

networks 1000 1200 and 1300 let's enable

rip on each of those interfaces net

10000 net

1200 net 1300 now we also have to

disable routing updates on interfaces

connected to switches g02 in this case

we will still advertise the network on

the g0 to interface 10000 to other

routers but because there is no router

in this direction it's not necessary to

send updates out of this interface and

for security purposes it can be a good

idea to stop these updates we can do

that with this command passive interface

g0 to

okay that's it let's go on to our to

enable compte router rip version 2 no

oto r2 is connected to three networks

2000 1200 and 2400 so let's configure

rip on each of those interfaces net

20000 net 12000 net 2400 now let's

disable routing updates on g0 to passive

interface g0 - that's all for our tea

now let's move on to our 3 enable compte

router rip version 2 no auto net 30000

net 1300 net 3400 dato passive interface

g0 - finally once more on our 4 enable

compte router rip version 2 no auto net

40000 net 2400 net 34000 passive

interface g0 - ok now let's wait a bit

for the routers to send all the routing

updates to each other and learn the

network this process is called

convergence while we're waiting let's

check out some stuff on our 4 and show

IP protocols this is a very handy show

command for checking information about

whatever routing protocol you are using

routing protocol is

rip as we configured here you can see

the default timers rip remember these

especially for the test update timer of

30 seconds invalid and hold-down timers

of 180 seconds and flush timer of 240

seconds

consult your study materials for

detailed explanations of each you can

also see information like which

interfaces updates are being sent out on

notice that the Gigabit Ethernet 0 2

interface isn't here although we can see

it is advertising the network down here

this is because we made it a passive

interface which is indicated here we can

also see which neighboring routers we

are getting updates from and when we got

the last update anyway let's go on PC

one now and see if we can ping each

other PC ping 2000 10 that's PC 2

it works next let's ping pc3 ping 3000

10 it works too finally PC for ping 4000

10

it works as well we have successfully

configured ripp to allow full

connectivity throughout the network
