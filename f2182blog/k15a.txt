welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab 4.547079you can download the lab

file from the link in the description 7.964095in

this lab we will use the system

configuration dialog to do some basic

setup of a router r1 and a switch switch

one the system configuration dialog is a

basic setup wizard that allows you to

perform basic setup of things like the

hostname and interface IP addresses of a

device although you typically will be

doing these things with the commands

themselves you should familiarize

yourself with the system configuration

dialog as well try to complete the lab

yourself first then continue watching

this video if you have trouble or watch

it after to check your solution

our goal is to do some basic

configurations on these two devices with

the system configuration dialog let's go

on our one first if this is the first

time entering the CLI you will be asked

whether you want to enter the system

configuration dialog however I have

already previously answered no to this

that's no problem I'll type in able to

enter privileged exec mode then use the

command setup and then answer yes to

enter the configuration dialog next we

are asked if you want to enter basic

management setup which as stated here

only configures enough connectivity for

management of the system let's go

through the extended setup this time

although we will only be configuring one

interface so let's type no now we are

asked if you want to see the current

interface summary the answer in brackets

is the default answer so I could just

hit enter to continue or type in no to

skip it I could of course type in yes to

I just don't have to I'll hit enter to

view the summary as you can see there

are three Gigabit Ethernet interfaces as

well as a VLAN one interface on our one

now we are asked for the hostname

currently it is router and that is also

the default answer let's change the

hostname to r1 now we are asked for the

enable secret as you may remember and as

is written here the enable secret is

used to enter privileged exec mode and

is automatically encrypted according to

the instructions for this lab let's use

an enable secret of Cisco with a capital

C which is important because these

passwords are case sensitive

next the enable password CCNA in all

caps then the virtual terminal password

we look at accessing the router over a

network interface in another lab for now

let's just set a password of CCENT in

all caps then we are asked if we want to

configure

SNMP network management I'll hit enter

to accept the default of no SNMP will be

for later labs then again as I don't

want to configure the VLAN one interface

at this time

now the Gigabit Ethernet 0 0 interface

is the one used to connect to switch 1

so let's configure it type yes and hit

enter the IP address is 192.168.1.1 and

now we'll accept the default subnet mask

of 255.255.255.0 by hitting Enter

I don't want to configure that gig 0 1

interface or that gig 0 2 interface now

we're at the final option we can cancel

this config with 0 redo it with 1 or

save the config with 2 let's accept the

default answer of 2 by hitting Enter

that's it now let's use show startup

config to confirm here's our hostname of

our one our encrypted enable secret and

our unencrypted enabled password the IP

address of gig 0 and the password on the

vty line which is the virtual terminal

mentioned before our ones configuration

is complete

next let's go through the setup dialog

for switch 1 and Nabal setup yes to

enter the configuration dialog know as

we don't want to enter basic management

setup let's just hit enter to view the

interface summary as you can see there

are a lot of interfaces which is

expected switches require more

interfaces than routers as they're going

to be connecting lots of end hosts to

them let's change the hostname to switch

1 and now the same passwords as on our 1

Cisco with a capital C for the enable

secret CCNA in all caps for the enable

password and C sent in all caps for the

virtual terminal password enter to

accept the default of no as we don't

want to configure SNMP at this time now

type yes and hit enter to configure the

VLAN 1 interface we're going to give the

VLAN 1 interface an IP address

note that physical switch interfaces or

switch ports cannot be given an IP

address however you can give an IP

address to one VLAN interface which can

then be used to connect to the switch

for management purposes something we'll

do in a later lab we're going to

configure the VLAN 1 interface here as

we're going to need the IP address to

receive the response from our one when

we ping it in the next step the IP

address will be 192.168.1.2 hit enter to

accept the default subnet mask of

255.255.255.0

now keep hitting Enter to skip

configuration of these interfaces we

won't be configuring them for now

type know as we won't be configuring

this as a cluster command switch which

is beyond the scope of this lab now hit

enter one more time to save the

configuration let's type show startup

config again to check there's the

hostname of switch one hour enable

secret and password our IP address on

VLAN 1 and our password on the vty lines

by the way for those wondering vty

stands for virtual teletype ok now

finally let's ping from switch 1 to our

one ping 192.168.1.1 the ping succeeds

that's all for this lab
