welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab 4.547079you can download the lab

file from the link in the description 7.964095in

this lab we will use the system

configuration dialog to do some basic

setup of a router r1 and a switch switch

one 17.951206the system configuration dialog is a

basic setup wizard that allows you to

perform basic setup of things like the

hostname and interface IP addresses of a

device 29.593011although you typically will be

doing these things with the commands

themselves you should familiarize

yourself with the system configuration

dialog as well 38.656193try to complete the lab

yourself first then continue watching

this video if you have trouble or watch

it after to check your solution
47.0438
our goal is to do some basic

configurations on these two devices with

the system configuration dialog 55.4966let's go

on r1 first 57.682979if this is the first

time entering the CLI you will be asked

whether you want to enter the system

configuration dialog 65.576508however I have

already previously answered no to this
69.674217
that's no problem I'll type in able to

enter privileged exec mode 74.077797then use the

command setup and then answer yes to

enter the configuration dialog 79.850683next we

are asked if you want to enter basic

management setup which as stated here

only configures enough connectivity for

management of the system 90.429979let's go

through the extended setup this time

although we will only be configuring one

interface 95.9823so let's type no 97.685636now we are

asked if you want to see the current

interface summary 103.045464the answer in brackets

is the default answer so I could just

hit enter to continue or type in no to

skip it 110.465146I could of course type in yes to

I just don't have to 114.309246I'll hit enter to

view the summary 117.366835as you can see there

are three Gigabit Ethernet interfaces as

well as a VLAN one interface on r1
124.883897
now we are asked for the hostname
127.958476
currently it is router and that is also

the default answer 132.232732let's change the

hostname to r1 135.763431now we are asked for the

enable secret as you may remember and as

is written here the enable secret is

used to enter privileged exec mode 146.568767and

is automatically encrypted 148.600481according to

the instructions for this lab 152.192444let's use

an enable secret of Cisco with a capital

C 156.07317which is important because these

passwords are case sensitive
159.088584
next the enable password 163.326876CCNA in all

caps 165.917872then the virtual terminal password
169.669834
we look at accessing the router over a

network interface in another lab for now

let's just set a password of CCENT in

all caps 178.281989then we are asked if we want to

configure

SNMP network management 184.343249I'll hit enter

to accept the default of no 187.244598SNMP will be

for later labs 189.702281then again as I don't

want to configure the VLAN one interface

at this time
195.325401
now the Gigabit Ethernet 0 0 interface

is the one used to connect to switch 1

so let's configure it 203.042621type yes and hit

enter 205.829633the IP address is 192.168.1.1 210.696433and

now we'll accept the default subnet mask

of 255.255.255.0 by hitting Enter
218.030646
I don't want to configure that gig 0 1

interface or that gig 0 2 interface 224.736546now

we're at the final option 228.297716we can cancel

this config with 0 redo it with 1 or

save the config with 2 235.216611let's accept the

default answer of 2 by hitting Enter
238.790694
that's it 240.231867now let's use show startup

config to confirm 244.263425here's our hostname of

our one 247.718703our encrypted enable secret and

our unencrypted enabled password 253.089857the IP

address of gig 0 258.947676and the password on the

vty line which is the virtual terminal

mentioned before 264.83408our ones configuration

is complete
267.795849
next let's go through the setup dialog

for switch 1 274.942063enable setup yes to

enter the configuration dialog 283.626909know as

we don't want to enter basic management

setup 288.481873let's just hit enter to view the

interface summary 292.068849as you can see there

are a lot of interfaces which is

expected switches require more

interfaces than routers as they're going

to be connecting lots of end hosts to

them 303.518577let's change the hostname to switch

1 307.155561and now the same passwords as on r1
310.770105
Cisco with a capital C for the enable

secret 314.950968CCNA in all caps for the enable

password 320.037908and C sent in all caps for the

virtual terminal password 323.940784enter to

accept the default of no as we don't

want to configure SNMP at this time 331.686529now

type yes and hit enter to configure the

VLAN 1 interface 336.90723we're going to give the

VLAN 1 interface an IP address
341.658118
note that physical switch interfaces or

switch ports cannot be given an IP

address 347.528874however you can give an IP

address to one VLAN interface 352.426624which can

then be used to connect to the switch

for management purposes something we'll

do in a later lab 357.287996we're going to

configure the VLAN 1 interface here 361.086722as

we're going to need the IP address to

receive the response from our one when

we ping it in the next step 366.686264the IP

address will be 192.168.1.2 372.56858hit enter to

accept the default subnet mask of

255.255.255.0
379.429832
now keep hitting Enter to skip

configuration of these interfaces 384.325061we

won't be configuring them for now
386.409478
type know as we won't be configuring

this as a cluster command switch which

is beyond the scope of this lab 397.432928now hit

enter one more time to save the

configuration 401.21944let's type show startup

config again to check 405.290424there's the

hostname of switch one 408.424046hour enable

secret and password 412.480064our IP address on

VLAN 1 417.703653and our password on the vty lines
421.658959
by the way for those wondering vty

stands for virtual teletype 427.609998ok now

finally let's ping from switch 1 to r1 431.309725 ping 192.168.1.1 the ping succeeds
439.360195
