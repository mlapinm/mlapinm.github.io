00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,960
to get all of the lab files for this course, so&nbsp;
you can try it out yourself in packet tracer.

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,640
If you want more labs like these, I&nbsp;
highly recommend picking up Boson’s NetSim&nbsp;&nbsp;

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,400
for the CCNA, click the link in the&nbsp;
video description to check it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,920
It’s a network simulator like packet tracer, but&nbsp;
it’s even better, and it includes all of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,480
guided labs to not only help you get hands-on&nbsp;
practice configuring and troubleshooting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,000
but also deepen your understanding of the exam&nbsp;
topics. I used it myself when studying for my&nbsp;&nbsp;

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,840
certifications, so I feel confident&nbsp;
about recommending it to all of you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,720
If you want to get your own copy of NetSim,&nbsp;
please follow the link in the video description.

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,680
In this lab we will do some simple IPv6 address&nbsp;
configurations. But there’s something different&nbsp;&nbsp;

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,480
in this lab than what I showed in the video.&nbsp;
This network is already running IPv4. R1 and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:19,760
PCs are already configured with IPv4 addresses.&nbsp;
We’re not going to remove the IPv4 configurations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:26,720
we’re simply going to add IPv6 configurations on&nbsp;
top. This is called a ‘dual-stack’ solution, it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

17
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:35,280
one way of transitioning your network from IPv4&nbsp;
to IPv6. You keep IPv4 running, add IPv6 on top,&nbsp;&nbsp;

18
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,680
and then slowly transition to using IPv6&nbsp;
exclusively. So, let’s add IPv6 to this network.

19
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:51,040
In step 1 we are told to enable IPv6 routing on&nbsp;
R1. IPv4 routing is enabled by default. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

20
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,800
configure interfaces and routes, the router will&nbsp;
forward IPv4 packets without having to separately&nbsp;&nbsp;

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:04,000
enable IPv4 routing. IPv6 routing, however,&nbsp;
is not enabled by default. However, just to&nbsp;&nbsp;

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,520
show you what happens if you don’t enable IPv6&nbsp;
routing, I’m going to skip step 1 until the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;

23
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:16,240
So let’s go straight to configuring IPv6&nbsp;
addresses on R1. Let’s open the CLI of R1.

24
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:36,000
ENABLE. CONF T. Let’s configure them in order.&nbsp;
INTERFACE G0/0. IPV6 ADDRESS 2001:DB8:0:1::1/64.&nbsp;&nbsp;

25
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,120
The interfaces are already enabled, because&nbsp;
this is already a functioning IPv4 network,&nbsp;&nbsp;

26
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,880
so we don’t need to use NO SHUTDOWN.&nbsp;
Okay, next interface. INTERFACE G0/1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

27
00:02:48,160 --> 00:03:07,634
IPV6 ADDRESS 2001:DB8:0:2::1/64. One more.&nbsp;
INTERFACE G0/2. IPV6 ADDRESS 2001:DB8:0:3::1/64.

28
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,400
Okay, that’s all for the interface configurations.&nbsp;
In step 3, let’s check the configurations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

29
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,840
DO SHOW IPV6 INTERFACE BRIEF.&nbsp;&nbsp;

30
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,480
These are the addresses we configured on the&nbsp;
interfaces, but also notice that link-local&nbsp;&nbsp;

31
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,600
IPv6 addresses were automatically configured,&nbsp;
too. You’ll learn about these in the next video.

32
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:39,280
Next up, let’s configure IPv6 addresses on&nbsp;
the PCs. I’ll go on PC1. Click on ‘config’.&nbsp;&nbsp;

33
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,040
And then from this first screen&nbsp;
here, set the IPv6 default gateway,&nbsp;&nbsp;

34
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:55,600
which should be R1. 2001:DB8:0:1::1. Next,&nbsp;
click on PC1’s FastEthernet0 interface,&nbsp;&nbsp;

35
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:09,520
and set PC1’s IPv6 address. 2001:db8:0:1::2,&nbsp;
and the prefix length, /64. Next up, PC2.

36
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:28,000
Again, set the default gateway. 2001:db8:0:2::1.&nbsp;
Then set PC2’s own address. 2001:db8:0:2::2,&nbsp;&nbsp;

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:42,960
/64. Finally, PC3. First set R1 as the default&nbsp;
gateway. 2001:db8:0:3::1. Then PC3’s address.&nbsp;&nbsp;

38
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:58,080
2001:db8:0:3::2, /64. Okay, now let’s go to step&nbsp;
5 and try some pings. I’ll do some pings from PC1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

39
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:11,760
First, let’s try to ping PC1’s default gateway,&nbsp;
R1’s G0/0 interface. PING 2001:DB8:0:1::1. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

40
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:23,920
the ping works. Can PC1 ping another interface&nbsp;
on R1? Let’s check. PING 2001:DB8:0:2::1. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

41
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,120
it can. So, PC1 can ping it’s default&nbsp;
gateway and R1’s interface in another subnet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

42
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:43,920
Can it ping PC2? Let’s try. PING 2001:DB8:0:2::2.&nbsp;
No, it can’t. Let’s try similar pings from PC2.

43
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:56,240
First, let’s ping PC2’s default&nbsp;
gateway. PING 2001:DB8:0:2::1. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

44
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:07,920
that works. How about R1’s G0/0 interface? PING&nbsp;
2001:DB8:0:1::1. Okay, that ping works as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

45
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:20,320
How about pinging to PC1? PING 2001:DB8:0:1::2.&nbsp;
Again, the ping between PCs doesn’t work. Why&nbsp;&nbsp;

46
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:27,280
is that? It’s because I skipped step 1, I didn’t&nbsp;
use the IPV6 UNICAST-ROUTING command on R1 yet.

47
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,240
So let’s go back to R1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

48
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:40,560
Use EXIT to return to global config mode.&nbsp;
And let’s enable it. IPV6 UNICAST-ROUTING.&nbsp;&nbsp;

49
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:52,375
Okay, now let’s go back to PC1 and try&nbsp;
to ping PC2 again. PING 2001:DB8:0:2::2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

50
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,680
Okay, the ping works. So, make sure you&nbsp;
don’t forget the IPV6 UNICAST-ROUTING&nbsp;&nbsp;

51
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:05,040
command when configuring IPv6 on a router.&nbsp;
Just to show that IPv4 is working as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

52
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:15,840
I’ll do an IPv4 ping to PC2. PING 192.168.2.2.

53
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,520
Okay, the ping works, so both&nbsp;
IPv4 and IPv6 are working.

54
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,840
Okay, that’s all for this lab. Now let’s take&nbsp;
a look at a lab in Boson NetSim for CCNA.

55
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,480
Okay, here's today's Boson NetSim lab preview.&nbsp;
Actually, this lab isn't from the regular Boson&nbsp;&nbsp;

56
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,000
NetSim for CCNA. It's from Boson's courseware&nbsp;
for CCNA, which they released recently.&nbsp;&nbsp;

57
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,080
It's essentially Boson's course for the CCNA&nbsp;
and it includes an extra set of labs which&nbsp;&nbsp;

58
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,360
you can do in NetSim. So, I've added a link&nbsp;
to Boson's courseware in the description.&nbsp;&nbsp;

59
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,160
So follow that link if you want to check&nbsp;
out Boson's courseware and try it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

60
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,440
So, the lab we're going to do&nbsp;
is called IPv6 Configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;

61
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:11,840
Here is the lab topology. As you can see,&nbsp;
IPv4 is already configured on these routers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

62
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:18,880
These are the commands you need to know. IPV6&nbsp;
ADDRESS, we covered. IPV6 UNICAST-ROUTING,&nbsp;&nbsp;

63
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,520
and there are some others we haven't looked&nbsp;
at yet. These are the IP addresses on each&nbsp;&nbsp;

64
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:34,160
device. The IPv4 addresses and then the IPv6&nbsp;
addresses, which I assume we will configure soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

65
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,840
And these are the tasks. Task&nbsp;
1, configure IPv6 addresses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

66
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,120
And Task 2, configure IPv6&nbsp;
between Router1 and Router2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

67
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,960
And then configure IPv6 between Router1&nbsp;
and Router3. Okay, so let's just do Task 1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

68
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:58,240
or at least part of task 1 for this lab&nbsp;
preview. In this task you will examine the&nbsp;&nbsp;

69
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,120
current network configuration and configure the&nbsp;
appropriate IPv6 addresses on the interfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;

70
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,800
You will only perform steps on the physical&nbsp;
interfaces shown in the IP addresses table.&nbsp;&nbsp;

71
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:17,360
Okay, got it. So A, examine the initial network&nbsp;
configuration. Examine the running config&nbsp;&nbsp;

72
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,880
of all routers. Do the IPv4 addresses&nbsp;
assigned to each router interface match&nbsp;&nbsp;

73
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,920
IP addresses shown in the IP addresses&nbsp;
table? Okay, let's quickly check that out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

74
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,840
ENABLE. I don't need CONF T&nbsp;
actually. SHOW RUNNING-CONFIG.&nbsp;&nbsp;

75
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,689
Serial0/0, that looks correct.&nbsp;
How about FastEthernet0/0?&nbsp;&nbsp;

76
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:55,360
That is correct also. Okay, next I will&nbsp;
open up the CLI of Router2. SHOW RUN.&nbsp;&nbsp;

77
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:07,920
Here's FastEthernet0/0, and the IP address is&nbsp;
correct, okay. Next up, Router3. ENABLE. SHOW RUN.&nbsp;&nbsp;

78
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,560
So, Serial0/0, that is correct.&nbsp;
Serial0/1 is correct also.&nbsp;&nbsp;

79
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,480
Okay, and finally let's check on Router4.&nbsp;&nbsp;

80
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:36,480
So, we are checking Serial0/0. That is correct.&nbsp;
Okay, so all of the IP addresses are correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;

81
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,280
What types of IP addresses are&nbsp;
currently assigned to the routers?&nbsp;&nbsp;

82
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:52,960
What types...IPv4, I guess. These are public IPv4&nbsp;
addresses. I will tell you later in the course&nbsp;&nbsp;

83
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:59,840
about public versus private IPv4 addresses, but&nbsp;
these are not private addresses. They are public.&nbsp;&nbsp;

84
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:08,480
What is the theoretical maximum number of unique&nbsp;
IP addresses of this type that can be assigned?&nbsp;&nbsp;

85
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,120
Of this type, I guess they might mean IPv4,&nbsp;
so that is roughly 4 billion, over 4 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

86
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,960
Actually, let me check Boson's answers for this&nbsp;
one. So I will scroll down. Under the lab tasks&nbsp;&nbsp;

87
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:34,800
there are lab solutions. Okay, so the answer&nbsp;
to question 2 was actually, the type is IPv4.&nbsp;&nbsp;

88
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:41,840
It's not asking specifically which type of&nbsp;
IPv4 address. It means are they IPv4 or IPv6?&nbsp;&nbsp;

89
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,960
Okay so, and I was correct, the maximum number&nbsp;
of unique IP addresses is over 4 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

90
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,040
Okay, number 4. Why is there a need to&nbsp;
change this method of IP addressing?&nbsp;&nbsp;

91
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,560
As I covered in the lecture video, there just&nbsp;
aren't enough IPv4 addresses for the modern world,&nbsp;&nbsp;

92
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,760
where everything is interconnected,&nbsp;
everything is connected to the Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

93
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:16,240
We just need more addresses. Okay, verify&nbsp;
IPv4 connectivity between Router3 and Router4&nbsp;&nbsp;

94
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,560
by issuing the ping...okay,&nbsp;
issuing pings between them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

95
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:33,920
Okay, so let's check. I'm already on Router4,&nbsp;
so I'll ping from here first. PING 180...this&nbsp;&nbsp;

96
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
is pinging from Router4 to Router3.&nbsp;&nbsp;

97
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,640
And it works. So the ping from Router3 to Router4&nbsp;
should work as well, but I'll do that anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

98
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,840
Okay, looks good. Okay, Part&nbsp;
B. Configure IPv6 addresses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

99
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,560
IPv6 addresses will eventually replace&nbsp;
the IPv4 addresses currently in use today.&nbsp;&nbsp;

100
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,120
What are the expected benefits of this new type&nbsp;
of IP addressing? Okay, so the only benefit I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

101
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:12,000
introduced so far is that there are many many&nbsp;
many times more IPv6 addresses available than&nbsp;&nbsp;

102
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,920
IPv4 addresses. And really, that's the&nbsp;
main reason, that's the main benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

103
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,360
What are some of the major differences?&nbsp;
For example, an IPv6 address is 128 bits,&nbsp;&nbsp;

104
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,960
versus an IPv4 address. There are of course&nbsp;
other differences, but we'll cover those later.&nbsp;&nbsp;

105
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,560
What is the theoretical maximum number?&nbsp;
Okay, it is a huge number that I cannot say.&nbsp;&nbsp;

106
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,000
Let's go down to the answer&nbsp;
and see that once more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

107
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,880
Well here it is. 3.4 times 10 to the power of 38,&nbsp;&nbsp;

108
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,120
which is a just ridiculously&nbsp;
huge number of IP addresses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

109
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,160
Briefly describe some of the techniques that&nbsp;
will allow IPv4 addressing to co-exist with&nbsp;&nbsp;

110
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,480
IPv6 addressing. Okay, well just in this&nbsp;
previous lab I introduced the idea of&nbsp;&nbsp;

111
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,000
'dual-stack', so running both&nbsp;
IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

112
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,200
Okay next, enable IPv6 packet forwarding&nbsp;
on Router3 and Router4. Okay, that's easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

113
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:30,720
Here on Router3, CONF T. IPV6 UNICAST-ROUTING.&nbsp;
And on Router4, CONF T. IPV6 UNICAST-ROUTING.&nbsp;&nbsp;

114
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,880
Okay, finally, I think I'll&nbsp;
end this lab here for now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

115
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,480
configure static IPv6 addresses for Router3's&nbsp;
Serial0/1 interface and Router4's Serial0/0&nbsp;&nbsp;

116
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,840
interface. Refer to the IP addresses table. Okay,&nbsp;
so Router3's Serial0/1, Router4's Serial0/0.&nbsp;&nbsp;

117
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:05,200
First, on Router3. INTERFACE S0/0.&nbsp;
And the command is IPV6 ADDRESS,&nbsp;&nbsp;

118
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:21,520
and that will be 2001:1:3:1::1/64. Okay, and that&nbsp;
should be it for Router3. Next, Router4. INTERFACE&nbsp;&nbsp;

119
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:30,960
S0/0. Actually, wait...okay,&nbsp;
I configured the incorrect&nbsp;&nbsp;

120
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:39,742
interface on Router3. So I will 'NO' that command&nbsp;
to cancel it out, and let's go to serial0/1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

121
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:49,120
Use the up arrow and enter the same IPv6&nbsp;
address again. Okay, that's correct. Okay now&nbsp;&nbsp;

Router4. IPV6 ADDRESS 2001:1:3:1::2/64.&nbsp;
Okay so that should be it. Let's try a ping&nbsp;&nbsp;

123
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:18,000
from Router4 to Router3. So I will PING IPV6,&nbsp;
and now Router3's address, 2001:1:3:1::1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

124
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:25,600
And the ping works. Okay, looks good. So that is&nbsp;
today's Boson NetSim lab preview. Again, this is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

125
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:32,640
special lab from Boson's courseware for CCNA. So&nbsp;
