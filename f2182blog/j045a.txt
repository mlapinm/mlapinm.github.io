Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,100
Also, remember to sign up via the link in
the description to get all of the lab files

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,730
for this course, so you can try it out yourself
in packet tracer.

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,090
If you want more labs like these, I highly
recommend picking up Boson’s NetSim for

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,989
the CCNA, click the link in the video description
to check it out.

11
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:40,079
It’s a network simulator like packet tracer,
but it’s even better, and it includes over

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,550
100 guided labs to not only help you
get hands-on practice configuring and troubleshooting,

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,139
but also deepen your understanding of the
exam topics.

14
00:00:48,139 --> 00:00:53,850
I used it myself when studying for my certifications,
so I feel confident about recommending it

15
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,569
to all of you.

16
00:00:55,569 --> 00:01:00,100
Watch until the end of this video, we’ll
take a look at a lab from NetSim.

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:06,870
If you want to get your own copy of NetSim,
please follow the link in the video description.

18
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,350
In this lab we will configure floating static
routes.

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,710
As I explained in the lecture video, floating
static routes are configured just like regular

20
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:20,510
static routes, except you set a higher administrative
distance value so that the route is less preferred

21
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,280
than a route learned by a dynamic routing
protocol.

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,390
So, although static routes by default have
an administrative distance of 5, lower than

23
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,250
any dynamic routing protocol, we can make
it function as a backup route by making the

24
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,910
AD higher.

25
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:45,210
In this network, Enterprise A has two LANs,
10.0.1.0/24 connected to R1 and 10.0.2.0/24

26
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,900
connected to R2, and R1 and R2 are directly
connected by fiber optic cabling.

27
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:58,620
R1 and R2 each have two Internet connections,
one to ISP A, with SPR1 and SPR2, meaning

28
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,990
Service Provider Router 1 and 2.

29
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:08,479
Also a connection to ISP B, here are ISP B
R1 and R2.

30
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,499
In this lab we are going to configure floating
static routes on R1 and R2 to act as backup

31
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:21,980
routes to allow R1 to reach R2 via ISP A,
even if the direct connection between R1 and R2 fails.

32
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,810
So, the first step is to check the routing
tables of R1 and R2.

33
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,950
I’ll check on R1 first.

34
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,500
ENABLE.

35
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,299
SHOW IP ROUTE.

36
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:38,900
So, we have connected and local routes for
each of R1’s interfaces, a static default

37
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:50,159
route pointing to 203.0.113.9, which is ISPBR1,
and a route to 10.0.2.0/24, learned via R2.

38
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,359
Which routing protocol was used to learn this
route?

39
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:58,110
This O here means OSPF, as you can see in
the legend up here.

40
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:04,379
So, Enterprise A is using OSPF as their IGP,
interior gateway protocol.

41
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:09,510
OSPF is by far the most common choice these
days, which is why it was selected by Cisco

42
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,549
as the only dynamic routing protocol you need
to learn in depth for the new CCNA.

43
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:19,269
Now, which route will be used if PC1 tries
to access SRV1?

44
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:26,760
SRV1’s IP address is 10.0.2.1, so the most
specific match is this one here to R2, the

45
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,079
OSPF route.

46
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:35,579
How about if PC1 tries to access the remote
server 1.1.1.1 over the Internet?

47
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:39,610
This server isn’t in the network diagram
by the way, but it’s somewhere on the Internet.

48
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:45,349
Well, the only route that matches is the default
route, so it will use the default route to

49
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:47,599
ISPB.

50
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,349
I will ping to test each of these, but first
let’s take a look at R2’s routing table.

51
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,409
ENABLE.

52
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:56,879
SHOW IP ROUTE.

53
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,689
So, its route table is similar to R1’s.

54
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:07,640
Connected and local routes for its interfaces,
a static default route to 203.0.113.13, which

55
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:16,299
is ISPBR2, and an OSPF route to 10.0.1.0,
learned via 10.0.0.1, which is R1.

56
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:25,070
So, if PC1 tries to ping SRV1, when SRV1 sends
the ICMP echo reply message back to PC1, R2

57
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,090
will forward it to R1, it won’t take the
path via ISP A.

58
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,870
Now let’s go on PC1 and try those pings.

59
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,690
So, I will use simulation mode to view the
path traffic takes, but first let me ping

60
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:44,360
both SRV1 and 1.1.1.1 from PC1 to allow all
of the devices in the path to complete the

61
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,450
ARP process.

62
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,400
First I’ll ping SRV1.

63
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:59,260
Ping 10.0.2.1.

64
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,480
Okay, next I’ll ping the remote server over
the Internet.

65
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:13,680
Ping 1.1.1.1.

66
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,720
Okay, looks good.

67
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,040
Now I’ll switch to simulation mode.

68
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,320
And let’s ping SRV1.

69
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,090
Ping 10.0.2.1.

70
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:31,850
It goes to R1, R2, then SRV1, which sends
it back via R2, R1, and then it reaches PC1.

71
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:38,760
Okay, I’ll switch back to realtime mode,
and cancel the ping using CTRL C. Next I’ll

72
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,530
ping the remote router, once again in simulation
mode.

73
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,120
Ping 1.1.1.1.

74
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:54,040
Okay, it goes to R1, matches the default route
on R1 and is sent to ISPBR1, which sends it

75
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,840
back to R1, then PC1.

76
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,880
I said 1.1.1.1 is a server somewhere on the
Internet, but of course there is no real Internet

77
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,770
in Packet Tracer, 1.1.1.1 is just an internal
interface on ISPBR1.

78
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,890
It’s called a ‘loopback’ interface.

79
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:16,360
I’ll talk about loopback interfaces soon
in the course, but let me quickly show you

80
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,140
on ISPBR1.

81
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,870
ENABLE.

82
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,990
SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.

83
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:30,490
So, I actually configured two loopback interfaces,
loopback0 and loopback1, although I ended

84
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,940
up only using one.

85
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:39,860
Similar to the SVIs on a Layer 3 switch, these
loopback interface are not physical interfaces,

86
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,960
but virtual interfaces inside of the router.

87
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,620
They have multiple uses which I will explain
in a later video, but one convenient use is

88
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,520
for labs like this, to simulate remote destination
networks without actually have to set them

89
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,840
up in the lab.

90
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,280
So, the ‘remote server’ 1.1.1.1 isn’t
actually a server, it’s just a virtual loopback

91
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,870
address on ISPBR1.

92
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:10,630
Okay, next for step 2 we are tasked with configuring
floating static routes on R1 and R2 so that

93
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,580
PC1 can reach SRV1 if the link between R1
and R2 fails.

94
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:20,890
So, we will configure one floating static
route each on R1 and R2, using ISP A as an

95
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,150
alternate path.

96
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,930
Let’s go on R1 first.

97
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,860
Enter global config mode to configure the
route.

98
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:36,650
CONF T. First, write the command as a normal
static route, so IP ROUTE, followed by the

99
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:45,990
destination network and mask, so 10.0.2.0
255.255.255.0, then the next-hop address,

100
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:53,310
which is the address of SPR1’s G0/0/0 interface,
so 203.0.113.1.

101
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,400
Now I’ll use the question mark.

102
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,750
It says ‘distance metric’.

103
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,889
The word metric might be a little confusing,
because this isn’t the metric that dynamic

104
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:09,340
routing protocols use to select the best route
to a destination, this is the AD, administrative distance.

105
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,080
So, to make it a floating static route we
have to set the AD higher than the route learned

106
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,980
via R2.

107
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,550
If we don’t do that, the static route will
be selected instead of the OSPF route to enter

108
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,520
the route table, which is not what we want.

109
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,460
We want the OSPF route to be used by default,
and this static route to be a backup.

110
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:35,130
OSPF has an AD of 110, so let’s go with
111.

111
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,190
Now let’s check the routing table.

112
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,520
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

113
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,020
Where’s the static route we just configured?

114
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:48,390
It’s not here, because we set the AD higher
than the OSPF route’s 110, the OSPF route

115
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,390
is selected instead of the static route.

116
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,779
Okay, we aren’t done, R2 still needs its
floating route or else the return traffic

117
00:08:55,779 --> 00:09:01,780
from SRV1 to PC1 won’t have a backup route
if the link between R1 and R2 goes down.

118
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,490
So, let’s configure that on R2.

119
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:18,740
CONF T. IP ROUTE 10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0, and
the next-hop will be SPR2’s G0/0/0 interface,

120
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:24,730
so 203.0.113.5, and let’s set the AD to
111 here as well.

121
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,830
Okay, let’s check the route table.

122
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,840
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

123
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,230
Just like on R1, the route doesn’t appear
yet.

124
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,990
Now let’s shut down R2’s G0/2/0 interface
and see if that changes.

125
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,450
INTERFACE G0/2/0.

126
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,760
SHUTDOWN.

127
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:50,460
Okay, now the OSPF route is invalid, it can
no longer be used to reach 10.0.1.0/24.

128
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,640
So, let’s check the route table and see
if the floating static route was inserted

129
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,040
into the table instead.

130
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,520
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

131
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,740
There it is.

132
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:09,060
10.0.1.0/24 via 203.0.113.5, and here you
can see the AD of 111.

133
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,790
Let’s go back on R1 and check.

134
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,190
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

135
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,480
Okay, same on R1, the floating static route
now appears in the route table.

136
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,150
So, let’s try that ping from PC1 to SRV1
again.

137
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:28,320
Once again, I will first ping in realtime
mode so that ARP can complete.

138
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,779
With this new route, R1, SPR1, SPR2, and R2
will have to use ARP again.

139
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:36,790
Okay, let’s ping.

140
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,680
PING 10.0.2.1.

141
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,140
Now, here’s a cool packet tracer trick.

142
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,400
Click this button here to fast forward 30
seconds in the simulation, to the point that

143
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,880
the ping is complete.

144
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,730
If your ping still hasn’t gone through,
try the ping again, and fast forward again

145
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,890
like this.

146
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:59,440
The pings are going , so ARP is complete,
now let’s switch to simulation mode and

147
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,870
ping again.

148
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,310
Ping 10.0.2.1.

149
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:10,029
Looks like the floating static route is working,
the ping to SRV1 now uses the backup path

150
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:15,610
via ISP A, and the return traffic does the
same.

151
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,550
Before finishing this lab, I’m going to
switch back to realtime mode and show you

152
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:23,800
another useful tool to check the path traffic
takes.

153
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,050
In a real network you can’t just turn on
simulation mode like in packet tracer to see

154
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,060
the path traffic takes.

155
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,590
Instead, you can use the traceroute tool.

156
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:40,740
In Cisco IOS the command is TRACEROUTE spelled
out like this, however on a Windows PC it’s

157
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:46,860
TRACERT, then the destination IP address,
which is 10.0.2.1.

158
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,860
There it is.

159
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,090
So, what does traceroute do?

160
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:56,080
It’s like a ping, except every Layer 3 ‘hop’
along the route to the destination sends a

161
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,670
message back to the source.

162
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:04,360
First is 10.0.1.254, R1’s G0/1 interface.

163
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,680
Next 203.0.113.1, SPR1’s G0/0/0 interface.

164
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:17,380
Then 192.168.1.2, SPR2’s G0/1/0 interface.

165
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:28,029
Then 203.0.113.6, R2’s G0/0/0 interface,
and finally the reply from 10.0.2.1, SRV1.

166
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:32,770
Traceroute is a very useful tool for troubleshooting
and making sure traffic is following the intended

167
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,300
path.

168
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,660
Make sure you’re aware of it for the exam,
and try it out in packet tracer labs!

169
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,930
Okay, that’s all for this lab.

170
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,839
Next, let’s take a look at a practice lab
from Boson NetSim.

171
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,980
Okay, for today's Boson NetSim practice lab
we're doing Static Routes 2.

172
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,710
So there are some OSPF configuration labs
in Boson NetSim, but we haven't covered configuration

173
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,480
of OSPF yet so let's do some static routing.

174
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,390
Here's the lab objective.

175
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:08,890
Build a lab network to test new configurations
that will be rolled out to a production network.

176
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,750
Configure Router1 and Router2 with static
routes so that all devices can ping any other

177
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,750
device.

178
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,040
Okay, so pretty simple lab topology here.

179
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,590
HostA and HostB, with Router1 and Router2.

180
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,890
And what's this, S0/0?

181
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,410
This is a serial connection.

182
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,100
So, I haven't covered serial connections in
the course, that's because they have been

183
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,790
removed from the exam topics list.

184
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:37,980
So I think you probably won't get any direct
questions about serial interfaces on the CCNA,

185
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,170
but I still think it's good to know so we'll
cover some basic things here.

186
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:46,850
One of those basic things here is the CLOCK
RATE command to set the, essentially the speed

187
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,560
of this serial interface.

188
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Okay, these are other commands you need to
know.

189
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:58,180
These IPCONFIG commands are for the NetSim
PCs here, HostA and HostB.

190
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:04,279
This command sets the IP address, and this
one IPCONFIG /DG sets the default gateway

191
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:06,390
address of the PC.

192
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:12,440
So that would be probably Router1 for HostA
and Router2 for HostB.

193
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:19,550
Okay, here are the IP address charts for each
device, and the lab tasks.

194
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,300
So let's get started on task 1.

195
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,480
Configure Router1 with a host name of Router1.

196
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,510
Okay, well we're already in the CLI of Router
1 here, it's open by default.

197
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,080
ENABLE.

198
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,490
CONF T. HOSTNAME Router1.

199
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,970
Okay, next configure the appropriate IP addresses
on the interfaces.

200
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,590
Refer to the IP addresses table.

201
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,520
Okay, let's do that next.

202
00:14:46,520 --> 00:15:01,130
So interface FastEthernet0/0, the IP address
is 192.168.101.1, /24 mask.

203
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,300
Enable the interfaces, it says right at the
end of here, so I'll just do that.

204
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,810
NO SHUTDOWN.

205
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,459
Okay next one, interface Serial0/0.

206
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:18,910
IP ADDRESS 192.168.1.1, /24 mask, NO SHUTDOWN.

207
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:23,800
Now this part here, a DCE cable is connected
to Router1.

208
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,149
The serial link should have a speed of 64
kilobits per second.

209
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:32,420
So this DCE is a concept in serial connections.

210
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,890
One side is DCE, the other side is DTE.

211
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,790
And the DCE side has to set the clock rate.

212
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:45,769
So we'll use this CLOCK RATE command to set
a speed of 64 kilobits per second.

213
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:48,589
CLOCK RATE, here are the options.

214
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:52,680
So we're looking for 64 thousand.

215
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,800
There we go.

216
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
Okay so that's step 1.

217
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:03,340
On Router1 configure a static route so that
all devices can ping any other device.

218
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:14,690
Okay so Router1 has these two connected networks,
192.168.101.0/24 and 192.168.1.0/24.

219
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:22,080
So the only network it needs a route to is
this network here, 192.168.100.0/24.

220
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,300
We could configure this as a default route,
but it doesn't specify that so let's configure

221
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,930
just a route to that subnet.

222
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:44,030
IP ROUTE 192.168.100.0, /24 subnet mask, and
the next hop will be Router2's Serial0/0 interface.

223
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,030
Okay let's check.

224
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,970
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

225
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:53,800
Oh, it's not up yet because this interface
is still down.

226
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,990
Okay, and then we do the same things on Router2,
it seems.

227
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:03,279
Yes, except on Router2's side we do not need
to configure the CLOCK RATE command because

228
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,650
it said Router1 is the DCE side, Router2 is
the DTE side.

229
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:13,510
So it will receive the clock rate from Router1.

230
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,260
So let's go into the CLI of Router2.

231
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,770
Click on Router2 here, then console.

232
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,770
ENABLE.

233
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:26,049
CONF T. HOSTNAME Router2, and then the IP
addresses.

234
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:32,280
So, INTERFACE F0/0.

235
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,850
100.1, with /24.

236
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,049
Enable it.

237
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:49,180
INTERFACE SERIAL0/0, IP ADDRESS 192.168.1.2,
again /24, NO SHUT.

238
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,220
Okay, I think that's all we have to do for
this step.

239
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:57,000
Yes, okay and next another static route, this
time on R2.

240
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,290
So we'll configure it to this subnet here.

241
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:11,540
EXIT, IP ROUTE 192.168.101.0 255.255.255.0
and the next hop is Router1's Serial0/0 interface,

242
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,600
192.168.1.1.

243
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,640
Okay, now if I check the routing table on
Router2 it should appear this time because

244
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,600
these interfaces are both UP now.

245
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,020
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

246
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,510
There it is, okay so connected routes and
the static route.

247
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:37,960
And if we check once more on R1, now they
appear, okay.

248
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,620
So that is up to step 4, okay next step 5.

249
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,830
HostA and HostB.

250
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:52,600
So let's get into the CLI here, HostA and
HostB.

251
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
So what was it?

252
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:01,100
Configure the IP addresses and default gateway,
okay.

253
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,740
So HostA, let's check first.

254
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,600
IPCONFIG /ALL.

255
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,340
Does not have an IP address.

256
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,730
and here are the commands we need to use.

257
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:17,840
So first, to set the IP address, IPCONFIG
/IP (address) (mask).

258
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,560
So let's do that.

259
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:32,780
IPCONFIG 192.168.101.2 255.255.255.0, and
I forgot the /IP.

260
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:41,210
Okay, and next the default gateway, IPCONFIG
/DG, and that would be this address here on

261
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,960
Router1, 192.168.101.1.

262
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,500
And let's check, IPCONFIG /ALL.

263
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:55,240
There is the IP address, subnet mask and default
gateway, looks good.

264
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,360
Next on HostB, first check if there are any
configurations.

265
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,030
Nope, all 0.0.0.0.

266
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:11,950
So IPCONFIG /IP 192.168.100.2, /24 mask.

267
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:23,500
And set the default gateway, that is this
address on Router2.

268
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,170
Okay, on Router1 and Router2 display the routing
table, oh we already did that.

269
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,520
I'll just do it one more time.

270
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:37,679
There they are, you can see the static routes
we configured, yep same here.

271
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:45,390
And verify your configuration by pinging from
HostA to HostB, 192.168.100.2, okay.

272
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:50,340
Let's hope it works.

273
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,730
Okay, looks good, pings are going through.

274
00:20:53,730 --> 00:21:00,790
Okay, so this time we actually did the entire
lab, so let's see if we did the correct configurations.

275
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:05,600
Once you have completed this lab, be sure
to check your work by using the grading function.

276
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,150
You can do that by pressing...clicking here,
grade lab.

277
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:13,740
Okay, let's see if we did it correctly.

278
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,980
And we did, you completed the lab successfully.

279
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,420
Click OK to view the results for the individual
devices.

280
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,290
So this is the correct configuration.

281
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:27,470
If we were missing commands they would be
highlighted in red here, if we had extra commands

282
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,930
that we didn't need they would be in blue.

283
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:37,820
So, all white here so looks good.

284
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,780
Okay, and if you ever have any trouble during
the lab, or even after you finish and you

285
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:46,430
want to read some explanations, which I really
recommend you do, check the lab solutions

286
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,430
here.

287
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:54,320
They give you step by step walkthroughs of
the lab, and some in-detail explanations.

288
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,610
Okay so that's Boson NetSim for CCNA.

289
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:03,250
If you can I highly recommend picking up a
copy, there are over a hundred guided labs
