welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer
practice lab 
5.510029
you can download the lab
file from the link in the description 
9.114439
in
this lab like the previous one we will
be working with two routers r1 and r2
16.887107
this time we will configure both an
enable password and an enable secret and
contrast the two 
24.713424
again I will only work
with one of the routers in this video
for the sake of time 
30.910102
but I recommend
that you perform the configurations on
both of the routers for practice 
35.799987
even
though it's not necessary for this lab
38.084682
also some of the steps here are things
we've already done in the previous lab
44.175245
this is on purpose 
46.075025
I don't know about
you but for me doing something just once
isn't sufficient for me to feel
confident that I can remember it 
53.080736
see if
you can complete the lab yourself first
57.118296
and then continue watching this video if
you have any trouble or watch it
afterwards to check your solution
63.254319
step one is to connect the two routers
by their Gigabit Ethernet 0 0 interfaces
73.870997
to do this click on the connections in
the bottom left corner 
78.039791
select the cable
and attach it to the gig 0 0 interface
on r1 and then on r2 
85.498783
that's all there is
to step 1 
88.081214
step 2 is to set the hostname
of each router according to the network
diagram 
96.757249
that is to r1 and r2 
99.349985
let's click
on our one and select CLI to access the
command-line interface 
104.960144
again we can see
that the routers hostname is currently
router 
109.00315
to set the hostname we have to be
in global configuration mode 
114.124844
currently
we are in exec mode 
116.841509
as indicated by the
greater than sign next to the current
router name 
121.29031
alt ipn or an able to enter
privileged exec mode 
126.732595
this is indicated
by the pound sign or hash tag whatever
you want to call it next to the host
name 
133.594869
from here I'll type compte or
configure terminal to reach global
configuration mode 
140.845422
from here I'll use
the host name r1 command to change the
host name to r1 
147.324613
you can see immediately
that the host name has changed to r1
151.745561
step 2 is now complete
154.373796
step three is to set the enable password
to Cisco 
161.972024
this is the same step as in the
previous lab 
164.776344
since we are already in
global configuration mode 
168.174473
I just have to
enter an able password Cisco to set the
enable password 
173.718627
that's step three
175.70937
step four is new to this lab now 
183.144987
we must
set the enable secret to CCNA 
187.017516
what is an
enable secret 
189.709976
well you may recall that
the enable password is not encrypted by
default 
194.661524
that means it is stored in clear
text in the configuration 
198.858348
to confirm
this I'll use the do show run command
202.373922
remember that that do allows us to use
commands in global configuration mode
207.519519
that we would normally have to be in
privileged exec mode to use 
210.931248
as you can
see the enable password is right there
in clear text 
215.469001
enable password Cisco not
very secure 
219.331723
the enable secret is a more
secure password because it is encrypted
by default 
224.997642
use the enable secret command
to create it 
229.270424
enable secret CCNA 
231.943415
step 4
is now complete
234.461481
Step five asks us to return to exec mode
240.695522
and try to enter privileged exec mode
once again 
243.772826
I'll type exit twice to
return to exec mode 
248.182503
now I'll use the
enable command to enter privileged exec
mode 
252.636177
and I am asked for a password 
254.982523
which
one should I enter 
257.067089
let's try the enable
password of Cisco 
260.376841
again the characters
are not shown as I type
264.322007
I tried Cisco three times and it doesn't
seem to work 
271.082343
let's use the enable
command again and this time try the
enable secret 
CCNA 
278.984926
as you can see the
enable secret works 
282.324785
this is important to
remember 
284.42278
if you create both an enable
password and an enable secret 
289.269375
although
both will be stored in the running
config 
292.850575
only the enable secret can be
used to enter privileged exec mode 297.518544
the
enable password is effectively useless
300.351229
that's step 5
302.458449
step 6 asks us to view the running
configuration 
308.391684
we're already in
privileged exec mode 
311.602004
so I'll just type
the show running config command 
314.621621
as you
can see the enable password is still in
plain text 
318.702385
enable password Cisco 
320.946094
however
our enable secret of ccna has been
encrypted 
325.689186
it now says enable secret five
followed by an unintelligible string of
characters 
331.850682
the five indicates the type
of encryption 
335.685431
don't worry about that for
now 
337.735784
just notice that the enable secret
has been encrypted without using the
service password encryption command that
we used in the previous lab 
346.321022
that's step
six
348.699647
step seven asks us to enable password
encryption 
357.243784
if you remember this is done
in global configuration mode 
361.530169
so I'll
type conf t get their 
364.190258
next service
password encryption 
367.300459
that's it
369.038546
now let's check the running config 
371.118877
do
show run 
372.848643
now both passwords are
encrypted 
375.118001
notice however that the enable
secret has not changed 
379.213029
because it is
already encrypted by default 
381.990927
also notice
that the enable secret uses type five
encryption 
386.712587
and that the enable password
uses type seven encryption 
390.288956
you can tell
just by looking at the strings that
follow that the encryption algorithms
are different 
396.325782
that's step seven
398.651033
step eight of this lab asks us to save
the configuration of the routers
405.546017
something we didn't do in the previous
lab 
407.568926
basically what we want to do is copy
the current running configuration to
what is called the startup configuration
415.521154
first let's compare the two 
418.194104
I'll exit to
privileged exec mode and type show run
422.103355
this is the current running
configuration 
424.919231
you can scroll down one
line at a time with the enter key or
blocks at a time with the spacebar
431.585528
notice that the enable password and
enable secret we created are here 
437.676567
now
let's type show startup config 
441.875875
it says
startup config is not present 
445.417804
this is
because this is a new router 
447.692901
and we
haven't saved anything on it 
449.721087
now there
are two ways to save the current
configuration
454.174775
the first one is copy running-config
startup config 
459.694103
or copy run start for a
shorter version if you prefer 
463.153016
it's
self-explanatory but this command copies
the running config to the startup config
469.308725
I'll enter the command and press ENTER
to confirm 
473.45887
now if we use the show
startup config command 
477.903188
it is identical
to the current running config 
480.925312
now there
is another even simpler way to do the
same thing 
485.789167
that is with the write to
command 
487.996812
that's it you can even shorten
it to just WR 
492.978607
copy running-config
startup config and write both do the
same thing 
498.731602
so use whichever you prefer
500.443004
now the final step is to reload the
router 
504.723301
I will do this with the reload
command
507.280191
and there we go 
512.969688
now you can see that the
hostname is still r1 
516.822981
this proves that we
successfully saved our changes 520.965983
I'll use
the enable command to enter privileged
exec mode 
524.536626
and as you can see I'm asked
for a password 
527.372019
this also proves that we
successfully saved our changes to the
configuration 
530.84509
I enter the enable secret
of CCNA and now I'm in privileged exec
mode 
536.374761
finally I'll type show startup
config just to confirm 
541.075903
as you can see
our changes are still there 
543.617492
step 8
and this lab are now complete 546.751275
