lab we will take a look at single area
OSPF 24.347059 we will configure it on these four
routers to achieve full connectivity
29.306814 OSPF also supports a hierarchical multi
area design 34.292008 but that will be for the
next lab 36.709070 this time we will do a simple
OSPF configuration and then do some
tweaking to affect the path traffic
takes 45.016886 the first step is to configure a
loopback address on each router 49.785727 note
that this isn't a necessary step for
OSPF 53.779688 however we will do this first so
that the loopback address becomes the
OSPF router ID each router uses to
identify itself to neighbors 63.455209 having
router ids of 1.1.1.1 2.2.2.2 69.560163 and so on
will simplify things 71.374589 as for how the
router ideas can is determined 77.419813 manual
configuration takes precedence 80.109361 however
if it's not manually configured the
highest loopback address becomes the red
or ID 86.243243 
if there is no loopback interface
address the highest address of another
interface becomes the router ID 93.235905 we
should create these loop backs before we
configure OSPF 98.311009 because if we do it after
the routers won't update the router IDs
unless we reset the OSPF process 105.864194 that's
no problem in a lab like this 109.188602 but in a
real network you can't just reset your
routing protocols at any time 113.132527 anyway
let's make those loopback interfaces 117.075660 on
r1 enable conf t interface l0 for
loop back 0 IP address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.255
 exit  135.473974 we don't have to use the no
shutdown command on a loopback interface
139.113685 next r2 enable conf t interface
l0 IP address 2.2.2.2 255.255.255.255
exit  156.573437 next r3 enable conf t interface
l0 IP address 3.3.3.3
255.255.255.255 exit  173.662666 finally r4
enable conf t interface l0 IP
address 4.4.4.4 255.255.255.255 exit 190.144249 
okay that's it for our loopback
addresses  192.949957 next let's configure OSPF on
each router and advertise the routes 198.664936 
let's go back to r1 200.499873  router OSPF
then we have to enter a process ID 206.090810  in
almost all circumstances you will only
use a single OSPF process on a router 212.110310 
however you can create multiple
processes and each will keep a separate
database 218.022330 
also the process ID is locally
significant  223.407330 it can be different on each
router and they can still become
neighbors 226.695080  just to prove that I'll use a
different router ID or sorry a different
process ID on each router 233.063684  let's go with
one for r1 236.396392  now let's advertise our
networks 240.135829  let me explain a little how
OSPF network command works 243.923079  it looks for
interfaces within the range stated in
the network command 248.863849  and then advertises
the network prefix on those interfaces 252.934224 
it doesn't necessarily advertise the
exact network used in the network
command  258.614766 for example network 12.0.0.0 then i
put in a wildcard mask which if you
remember is inverse of a regular mask 269.231516 
the 12.0.0.0 network is configured as a
/24  274.600245 but if I for example configure
a /8 with 0 255 255 255 281.050995  it will
still advertise the slash 24 network on
f10  286.302307 not a slash 8  288.187223 okay next enter area
followed by the area number  293.259806 this is
single area OSPF so let's just put 0 on
all of these  298.096931 next one the G 0 0
interface  302.032930 network   14.0.0.0 I'll set it as a
/16 this time  308.945096 just the show
anything works as long as the interface
prefix falls within that range
 314.055471 0.0.255.255 area 0  319.636407 finally the
loopback address  323.079219 network 1.1.1.1 0.0.0.0
area 0  330.279863 this time i configured the exact
/ 32 mask on the interface  335.341863 I'll state it
one more time because it's very
important to understand this 340.110113  G 0 0 and F
1 0 will advertise the network prefix
actually configured on the interface 347.311946  not
the /8  / 16 prefixes I configured
here 352.346716 
okay now let's set up OSPF on the other
routers  356.755736 and I'll show you a useful
shortcut  359.115903 I'll go on r2 361.231966  routes OSPF 365.103653  and again I'll use a different process
ID to show that it can still become
neighbors with r1 and r3  370.934257 so I'll use a
process ID of two  373.998007 now as for that
shortcut I mentioned it's a way to
activate OSPF on all interfaces with a
single command  381.477861 this is useful for labs
but perhaps you might not want to do it
on a real network where you want a more
precisely control which interfaces OSPF
is activated on  391.915673 network 0.0.0.0
followed by a /0 mask which is
usually 0.0.0.0  402.539068 but because we have to
use a wildcard mask it is inverse it is
255 255 255 255 area 0  411.885693 ok all
networks fall within the 0.0.0.0/0 range so OSPF will be activated on
all interfaces  421.669213 let's do the same quickly
on r3 and r4 425.717005  r3 first router OSPF 3
network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255  area
0  438.987856 then R4  444.566856 router OSPF 4 network
0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255
area 0  452.472105 ok now let's go back to r1 and
see what's up 456.423334  do show IP ospf neighbor 462.522396 
now we can see that r1 has become
neighbors with r2 and r4 467.783709  also notice
that the loopback interfaces we
configured have indeed become the router
IDs of r2 and r4  475.032334 also the router
successfully became neighbors even
though we use different process IDs on
each router  482.687521 proving that the process ID
is only locally significant 485.872354 
next let's check the routes we received
here on r 1 490.770292  do show IP route  493.561958 here
are the loop backs of r2 r3 and r4 and
here are the 2300 and 3400 networks to
which our one isn't directly connected 506.858832 
note that they have an O beside them 510.245186 
meaning that they were learned via OSPF 513.366498 
also notice that r1 learned the network
prefix is configured on each of the
interfaces  519.663290 not the network prefix we
actually configured on r2 r3 and r4 524.576956 
actually we configured  0.0.0.0/0
on them and there is no  0.0.0.0/0 Network in the table here  534.596788 so that
demonstrates the point as well  536.927141 now the
next step is to suppress OSPF messages
on the loopback addresses or sorry
loopback interfaces of each router 546.314558 
because OSPF is activated on the
loopback interfaces 550.548745  each router is
sending OSPF advertisements on them 554.398849 
however the loopback interface doesn't
actually lead to anywhere beyond the
router itself  559.900870 so there's no point of
advertising anything on them  562.724661 to suppress
the advertisements we configure the loop
backs as passive interfaces with this
command  569.685411 passive interface l0 573.153140  that's all 574.977807 
let's quickly do the same on the other
routers 577.876370  first r2 581.061557  passive interface
l0  583.977244 then r3 586.250452  passive interface l0 589.940556 
finally r4 592.625306  passive interface l0 596.405118  the
next step is to configure the OSPF
reference bandwidth of each router  603.111055 so
that a 10 Gigabit Ethernet interface
would have an OSPF cost of 1  608.922138 what
exactly does that mean 611.605722  well from r1s perspective it has two routes to
reach r3  617.647034 it can go via r2
or via r4  621.899200 how does it decide which path
to use  625.762825 let's go back to r1 and look at
their routing table  629.663075 notice beside these
OSPF routes there is a 110  635.701741 which is the
administrative distance for OSPF  639.245886 I won't
talk about administrative distance now
hopefully you've studied it  644.030845 however next
to it is the metric  647.330928 notice that the
metric via r2 and the metric via r4 are
the same so both are in the routing
table  655.585782 however why are both the same  659.749073 when
the path via r4 includes a faster
gigabit ethernet interface  664.171135 well to
calculate metric OSPF divides a
reference bandwidth by the bandwidth on
the interface  673.082718 the reference bandwidth by
default is 100 megabits per second  677.931073 and a
fast ethernet interface is 100 megabits
per second  682.701823 so a fast ethernet interface
has a metric of 1 which is 100 divided
by 100  688.635968 a Gigabit Ethernet interface has
a bandwidth of 1,000 megabits per second 694.449114 
100 divided by 1,000 is 0.1 698.760947  however the
lowest possible metric in OSPF is 1  703.809759 so
gigabit and fast ethernet interfaces
have the same metric by default 1  709.343905 even a
10 gigabit or 100 gigabit interface
would have a metric of 1 715.762030  to change this
default behavior we can change the
reference bandwidth with this command 721.732739 
auto cost reference bandwidth then the
bandwidth in terms of megabits per
second  728.780093 our instructions say to make it
so that a 100 gigabit interface oh sorry
a 10 gigabit interface would have a cost
of 1  738.471259 so we should set the reference
equal to 10 gigabits per second  742.614342 so I'll
enter 10,000  746.180988 as this message says here
make sure the reference is consistent
across all routers 752.169779 
let's go on r2   754.375404   auto cost reference
bandwidth ten thousand 761.808508 
okay next r3 764.739862  auto cost reference
bandwidth ten thousand  769.607882 finally r4 772.149382 
auto cost reference bandwidth ten
thousand  777.236527 okay let's check again on r1 780.789257  do show IP route  784.751340 now we only have
one route 3.3.3.3
via the gig 00 interface  791.585735 because
OSPF now distinguishes between the cost
of a gig Ethernet and the cost of a Fast
Ethernet interface  798.777026 now our last step
isn't something you'd likely do in a
real network  803.725713 but I want to show you that 
you can do it  807.753650 after adjusting the
reference bandwidth so that r1 will take
the path of via r4 to our freeze
loopback exclusively 814.585712  we are now going to
configure the opposite  817.567399 and make it use
the path to r2 exclusively 820.159836  we will do
this by configuring the OSPF cost of
some interfaces  825.409148 now there are multiple
ways to do this  828.740189 we can do it by lowering
the cost of some interfaces or by
raising the cost of others or a
combination 836.016376  just to make this quick for
the video I'll raise the cost of the g00
link between r1 and r4 to 10000 845.707313 
I'll start on r1 848.281688  interface g00 to
change the cost use this command  855.308563 IP ospf
cost 10000   859.193792 okay now let's do the
same on r4s end  862.272958 interface g00  866.669583 IP
ospf cost 10000     870.359478 now let's go back
on r1 873.439207  do show IP route  876.650727 okay now the
route to 3.3.3.3 has
changed back to r2 exclusively 883.955248  because
we manually adjusted the cost of
Gig 00 your interface 887.858789  despite the
fact that the path via r4 is actually
faster 891.872518  we covered a lot of different
things in this lab  896.131830 OSPF is very
important both for the exam and because
it's widely used in real networks 902.372517  make
sure you know the commands required 905.418600  I
will also be making a few more OSPF labs
 908.813892 so be sure to practice further with
those  911.311412 that's all for this lab 913.302704  thank you
