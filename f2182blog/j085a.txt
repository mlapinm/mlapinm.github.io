If you want more labs like these, I highly&nbsp;
recommend picking up Boson’s NetSim for the CCNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,800
It’s a network simulator with tons of guided&nbsp;
labs covering all of the topics you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,200
know for the CCNA. Click the link in&nbsp;
the video description to check it out.

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:50,800
In this lab we’ll practice configuring static NAT&nbsp;
on R1. PCs 1, 2, and 3 have private IP addresses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,320
so they are unable to access the Internet.&nbsp;
We need to configure NAT on R1 to allow them&nbsp;&nbsp;

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,680
to use the Internet, for example to access&nbsp;
8.8.8.8, a DNS server. So let’s do step 1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

12
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:13,040
which is to ping from PC1 to 8.8.8.8. So, from&nbsp;
the CLI of PC1 I’ll try that. PING 8.8.8.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,120
It will take a bit of time for each ping&nbsp;
to timeout, but all four pings should fail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,280
R1 will try to send the pings&nbsp;
out over the Internet, but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,120
ISP will simply drop the traffic,&nbsp;
because of the private IP address.

16
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,480
So let’s get right into static NAT&nbsp;
configuration on R1 in step 2. First,&nbsp;&nbsp;

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:42,400
let’s configure the inside and outside&nbsp;
interfaces. ENABLE. CONF T. INTERFACE G0/0.&nbsp;&nbsp;

18
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,880
Is this the inside or outside interface? Well,&nbsp;
it’s the interface connected to the Internet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

19
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,760
to the external network, so it’s the&nbsp;
outside interface. IP NAT OUTSIDE. And next,&nbsp;&nbsp;

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:03,280
INTERFACE G0/1. This interface is connected&nbsp;
to the internal network, so IP NAT INSIDE.

21
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,840
Okay, next let’s configure those static NAT&nbsp;
mappings. EXIT. So, we’ll map each PC’s private IP&nbsp;&nbsp;

22
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:24,640
to a public IP in the 100.0.0.0/24 subnet. I’ll do&nbsp;
PC1 first. IP NAT INSIDE SOURCE STATIC 172.16.0.1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

23
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,160
and then I’ll map it to 100.0.0.1, keeping the&nbsp;
host portion the same to make it simple. Next&nbsp;&nbsp;

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:41,200
I’ll hit the up arrow, and change these addresses&nbsp;
to 100.0.0.2 and 172.16.0.2 for PC2. And then do&nbsp;&nbsp;

25
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:51,040
that again, 100.0.0.3 and 172.16.0.3 for PC3. And&nbsp;
that’s it, our static NAT configuration is done.&nbsp;&nbsp;

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,440
EXIT. Now, before trying that ping again from PC1&nbsp;
let’s check the NAT translations and statistics.&nbsp;&nbsp;

27
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,000
SHOW IP NAT TRANSLATIONS. Here you can see&nbsp;
the three static mappings we just configured,&nbsp;&nbsp;

28
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,000
mapping these inside local addresses to&nbsp;
inside global addresses. Now let’s check the&nbsp;&nbsp;

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,240
statistics. SHOW IP NAT STATISTICS. Okay, 3 total&nbsp;
translations, and here are the outside and inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

30
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,920
interfaces we configured. Now let’s try some pings&nbsp;
and then we’ll check the translations again after.

31
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:39,120
First I’ll ping from PC1 to 8.8.8.8. PING&nbsp;
8.8.8.8. Okay, the ping works this time. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

32
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:48,080
step 4 says to ping google.com from each PC. I’ve&nbsp;
configured 8.8.8.8 as the DNS server of each PC,&nbsp;&nbsp;

33
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,560
so they should contact 8.8.8.8 to learn the IP&nbsp;
of google.com, and then they should be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

34
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:02,800
ping google.com. So, PING google.com. Okay, it&nbsp;
works. Now I’ll try to ping google from PC2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

35
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:15,200
PING google.com. Okay, it works here too. And&nbsp;
finally the same from PC3. PING google.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;

36
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,360
Okay, the ping works, so let’s&nbsp;
check the translations on R1.

37
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,280
SHOW IP NAT TRANSLATIONS. Okay, there&nbsp;
are a lot of translations this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

38
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,800
Here you can see the static translations, still in&nbsp;
the table. Below them are three UDP translations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

39
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,080
all for destination 8.8.8.8 port 53.&nbsp;
These dynamic entries are for when PC1, 2,&nbsp;&nbsp;

40
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:51,440
and 3 used DNS to learn the IP of google.com. And&nbsp;
all of these entries up above are for the pings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

41
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,760
Notice, as I pointed out in the lecture, that&nbsp;
the inside local address is translated to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

42
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,640
inside global address, but the outside local&nbsp;
and outside global addresses are the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;

43
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,360
That’s because we’re only doing&nbsp;
source NAT, not destination NAT.

44
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,880
Okay, finally step 5 is to&nbsp;
clear the NAT translation table.&nbsp;&nbsp;

45
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:21,120
So, the command is CLEAR IP NAT TRANSLATION, and&nbsp;
then an asterisk. Now let’s check which entries&nbsp;&nbsp;

46
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,080
remain. SHOW IP NAT TRANSLATIONS. All of the&nbsp;
dynamic entries are gone, and only the static&nbsp;&nbsp;

47
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,680
entries remain. As I mentioned in the lecture,&nbsp;
the dynamic entries will timeout after a certain&nbsp;&nbsp;

48
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,360
period of time and be cleared from the table, but&nbsp;
this command lets you manually clear them. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

49
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,280
so in this lab we practiced configuring static&nbsp;
source NAT. That’s all for this lab. Next,&nbsp;&nbsp;

50
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,840
let’s take a look at a bonus practice lab&nbsp;
from Boson Software’s NetSim for CCNA.

51
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:58,960
Okay here's today's Boson NetSim practice lab.&nbsp;
So the lab I have selected is Static NAT 1. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

52
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,840
in Boson NetSim for CCNA there are five different&nbsp;
NAT labs, and two of them cover static NAT.&nbsp;&nbsp;

53
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,240
So here is the lab topology, and it looks like&nbsp;
we are going to configure NAT here on Router4,&nbsp;&nbsp;

54
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,560
because it's connected to what seems like&nbsp;
an internet router, and this is its internal&nbsp;&nbsp;

55
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,200
network with switch1, switch2, and&nbsp;
two PCs, PC1 and PC3. So these are&nbsp;&nbsp;

56
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,000
the commands you need to know. All commands&nbsp;
we've already covered in the lecture video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

57
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:38,480
The IP addresses of each device and here are the&nbsp;
lab tasks. Okay, so there are eleven steps in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

58
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:45,280
one single lab task, so let's go through all of&nbsp;
them. First, attempt to ping from PC1 to Router3.&nbsp;&nbsp;

59
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,120
Was the ping successful? Why or why&nbsp;
not. Okay, so I will open up PC1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

60
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:05,440
And attempt to ping Router3. Let's&nbsp;
see if that works. Was it .1.1? Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

61
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:21,120
Okay it seems the ping is not working. Okay,&nbsp;
so perhaps Router3 is a internet router,&nbsp;&nbsp;

62
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:30,240
so it is not accepting these pings that have a&nbsp;
source IP address that is a private IP address.&nbsp;&nbsp;

63
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,520
Okay, on Router4 configure NAT to statically&nbsp;
translate PC1's IP address to 180.10.1.15.&nbsp;&nbsp;

64
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:48,080
Okay, so let's do that. So I'll open the&nbsp;
CLI of Router4. The password is cisco, okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

65
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:56,160
So let's configure that mapping. IP&nbsp;
NAT INSIDE SOURCE STATIC, and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

66
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:08,560
PC1's IP address is, here it is. 192.168.1.2.&nbsp;
And we will map it to 180.10.1.15. Okay, so we've&nbsp;&nbsp;

67
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,040
configured the mapping, but that's not all you&nbsp;
need to configure for static NAT, as you know.&nbsp;&nbsp;

68
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:22,240
Okay, which interface should be configured&nbsp;
as the inside interface on Router4? Okay, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

69
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,760
it should be fastethernet0/1, that is the inside&nbsp;
interface. And then the outside will be serial0/0.&nbsp;&nbsp;

70
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,360
Okay, so let's configure those interfaces.&nbsp;
INTERFACE FASTETHERNET0/1 is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

71
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:44,160
inside, so IP NAT INSIDE. And&nbsp;
INTERFACE SERIAL0/0. IP NAT&nbsp;&nbsp;

72
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:55,680
OUTSIDE. Okay and let's try that ping again&nbsp;
from PC1 to Router3. Okay, it works. Perfect.&nbsp;&nbsp;

73
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:04,720
Okay let's check that NAT translation table&nbsp;
on Router4. DO SHOW IP NAT TRANSLATION.&nbsp;&nbsp;

74
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:13,760
Okay so we have the static mapping here. Looks&nbsp;
like there are two entries for that. I'm not&nbsp;&nbsp;

75
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:23,600
sure about why that is. And then the entry for the&nbsp;
ping we just issued. The inside local IP address&nbsp;&nbsp;

76
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,480
is translated to what inside global address? Well&nbsp;
that's what we just configured, 180.10.1.15. Does&nbsp;&nbsp;

77
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,400
the inside global IP address normally represent a&nbsp;
public or a private IP address? Well it normally&nbsp;&nbsp;

78
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,760
represents a public IP address because it is&nbsp;
the global one, it's what the outside network,&nbsp;&nbsp;

79
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:49,360
for example the internet, knows. And you can't&nbsp;
use private IP addresses on the Internet. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

80
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,640
step 8. On Router4 configure NAT to statically&nbsp;
translate PC3's IP address to this IP, .16.&nbsp;&nbsp;

81
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:12,560
Okay so let's do that. IP NAT INSIDE SOURCE STATIC&nbsp;
192.168.1.3, is PC3's IP address. And 180.10.1.16.&nbsp;&nbsp;

82
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,240
Okay, so display the NAT translation&nbsp;
table again. Let's do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

83
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:31,840
Okay, I can see mapping for both of&nbsp;
them. So, 192.168.1.3 is mapped to .16.&nbsp;&nbsp;

84
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,560
Okay let's try that ping, from,&nbsp;
oh it says from Router3 to PC1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

85
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:48,320
Interesting, okay. So I will open up Router3.&nbsp;
That is here. Router3 attempting to ping PC1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

86
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,080
So, I think this will not work because it's&nbsp;
a router out on the Internet trying to ping&nbsp;&nbsp;

87
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:01,520
a public, oh sorry not a public, a private IP&nbsp;
address. So that should fail. But let's try.&nbsp;&nbsp;

88
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:10,480
PING 192.168.1.2. Yes, and&nbsp;
that U means unreachable,&nbsp;&nbsp;

89
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:20,880
okay. Attempt to ping from Switch2 to Router3.&nbsp;
From Switch2, does Switch2 have an IP address?&nbsp;&nbsp;

90
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:30,560
Let's check. SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.&nbsp;
Okay, it does have an IP address.&nbsp;&nbsp;

91
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:41,440
But NAT is not configured on Router4&nbsp;
to translate Switch2's IP address,&nbsp;&nbsp;

92
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,120
so this should not work. But&nbsp;
let me try. PING 180.10.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

93
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,920
Okay, and just like in the beginning with PC1,&nbsp;
no NAT is configured for Switch2's IP address,&nbsp;&nbsp;

94
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:05,600
so Switch2 is not able to ping Router3. Okay so&nbsp;
that's all for this lab. I'm going to click on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

95
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:13,120
grade lab function here, and let's see if I did&nbsp;
everything correctly. Okay, yes I did, awesome.&nbsp;&nbsp;

96
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,560
Great, and by the way if you ever have&nbsp;
any problems during these labs in NetSim,&nbsp;&nbsp;

97
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,960
Boson provides solutions down at the&nbsp;
bottom here, with some great explanations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

98
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,560
actually if you want to read these you can&nbsp;
pause the video, I'll scroll through them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

99
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,000
Okay, so that was a quick look at a lab&nbsp;
in Boson Software's NetSim for CCNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

100
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,720
NetSim has over 100 guided labs like these. Some&nbsp;
of them are pretty short and simple like this one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

101
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,600
but then some of them are actually&nbsp;
quite difficult and complicated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

102
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,200
So I think it's a great study resource,&nbsp;
a great labbing resource for the CCNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

103
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,120
