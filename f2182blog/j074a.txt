4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,240
In this video we will cover DHCP,&nbsp;
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.&nbsp;&nbsp;

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,800
Just like DNS, DHCP is a protocol that you’re&nbsp;
certainly using every day, even if you’re not&nbsp;&nbsp;

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:37,360
aware of it. DHCP allows DHCP clients, usually end&nbsp;
devices like PCs, phones, etc, to automatically&nbsp;&nbsp;

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,840
learn which IP address to use from a DHCP server,&nbsp;
instead of us having to manually configure it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,760
However DHCP allows devices to learn much more&nbsp;
than just their IP address, as you’ll see in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:58,240
video. DHCP is part of exam topics 4.3, explain&nbsp;
the role of DHCP and DNS within the network,&nbsp;&nbsp;

10
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:06,080
and 4.6, configure and verify DHCP client and&nbsp;
relay. Actually DHCP is also mentioned in section&nbsp;&nbsp;

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,840
5.0, security fundamentals, however we’ll leave&nbsp;
security for a separate section of the course.

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,880
Here’s what we’ll cover in this video. First&nbsp;
I’ll outline the basic purpose of DHCP,&nbsp;&nbsp;

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,880
and why we use it. Then I’ll introduce the&nbsp;
basic functions of DHCP, specifically the&nbsp;&nbsp;

14
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,920
four-message exchange that clients use&nbsp;
to get an IP address from a DHCP server.&nbsp;&nbsp;

15
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:38,160
Then I’ll show you how to configure DHCP in&nbsp;
Cisco IOS. A Cisco router can be a DHCP server,&nbsp;&nbsp;

16
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:44,400
a DHCP client, or something called a ‘DHCP&nbsp;
relay agent’. I’ll show you how to configure&nbsp;&nbsp;

17
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,360
all of those. Make sure to watch until&nbsp;
the end of the video for a bonus practice&nbsp;&nbsp;

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,200
question from Boson Software’s ExSim for&nbsp;
CCNA, the best practice exams for the CCNA.

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:04,480
Here’s a brief overview of DHCP. DHCP is used to&nbsp;
allow hosts to automatically and dynamically learn&nbsp;&nbsp;

20
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,480
various aspects of their network&nbsp;
configuration such as IP address,&nbsp;&nbsp;

21
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:14,240
subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server,&nbsp;
etc, without manual and static configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;

22
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,440
It is an essential part of modern networks, I’m&nbsp;
certain you’re using it everyday. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

23
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,960
when you connect a phone to WiFi, do you ask the&nbsp;
network admin, whoever’s running the network,&nbsp;&nbsp;

24
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,680
which IP address, subnet mask, default gateway,&nbsp;
etc, the phone or laptop should use? Probably not,&nbsp;&nbsp;

25
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,040
we all expect that once we connect to WiFi&nbsp;
we’ll automatically have access to the network&nbsp;&nbsp;

26
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,880
and the Internet. It’s probably the same in your&nbsp;
home network. If you connect your PC to your&nbsp;&nbsp;

27
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,320
home router, you probably don’t need to manually&nbsp;
configure your PC’s IP address, default gateway,&nbsp;&nbsp;

28
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:57,360
etc. Of course, you can do that if you want, and&nbsp;
some of you probably do. In a small network manual&nbsp;&nbsp;

29
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,840
configuration isn’t such a difficult task. However&nbsp;
in large networks DHCP’s role is very important.&nbsp;&nbsp;

30
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:11,600
Note that DHCP is typically used for ‘client’&nbsp;
devices such as workstations, PCs, phones, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;

31
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Devices such as routers, servers,&nbsp;
etc, are usually manually configured.&nbsp;&nbsp;

32
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,800
This is because they need to have a fixed&nbsp;
IP address to perform their function.&nbsp;&nbsp;

33
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,320
If the default gateway of the network kept&nbsp;
changing it would obviously not be ideal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

34
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,800
In small networks (such as home networks) the&nbsp;
router typically acts as the DHCP server for&nbsp;&nbsp;

35
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,560
hosts in the LAN. If you have a router in your&nbsp;
home, it’s probably acting as the DHCP server&nbsp;&nbsp;

36
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,400
for all of your devices. However in larger&nbsp;
networks, such as a large enterprise network,&nbsp;&nbsp;

37
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,160
the DHCP server is usually&nbsp;
a Windows or Linux server.

38
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,800
Now I’ll give a brief demonstration&nbsp;
of DHCP’s function using my own PC,&nbsp;&nbsp;

39
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,840
which is running Windows 10. If your PC is&nbsp;
running Windows, I recommend following along.&nbsp;&nbsp;

40
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,480
This is the ‘network and sharing center’, which&nbsp;
can be accessed from the control panel. I’m going&nbsp;&nbsp;

41
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,320
to select my PC’s Ethernet0 connection, which is&nbsp;
connected to my home router via an Ethernet cable.

42
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,280
This is what you’ll see after opening it. Here&nbsp;
I select the properties of my PC’s Ethernet&nbsp;&nbsp;

43
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,080
connection, Ethernet0. Then the properties are&nbsp;
displayed. I select the IPv4 properties here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

44
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:34,000
This window opens up. Here I can confirm that&nbsp;
my PC is using DHCP. Here it says ‘obtain an&nbsp;&nbsp;

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,600
IP address automatically’. And down here it&nbsp;
says ‘obtain DNS server address automatically’.&nbsp;&nbsp;

46
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,920
‘Automatically’ means that my PC will use DHCP&nbsp;&nbsp;

47
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,040
to learn which IP address, subnet mask,&nbsp;
default gateway, and DNS server it should use.

48
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,120
Let’s take a look at what was automatically&nbsp;
configured. I used the IPCONFIG /ALL command,&nbsp;&nbsp;

49
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,560
which you already know. First off, notice&nbsp;
that it tells us that DHCP is enabled.&nbsp;&nbsp;

50
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,880
If I had manually configured my PC’s&nbsp;
IP address in the previous menu,&nbsp;&nbsp;

51
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,800
‘No’ would display here. And here is&nbsp;
the IPv4 address my PC was assigned,&nbsp;&nbsp;

52
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:21,440
192.168.0.167 with a /24 subnet mask. Notice that&nbsp;
it says ‘preferred’ here. What does that mean?&nbsp;&nbsp;

53
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,040
It means that this PC was previously&nbsp;
assigned this IP address by the DHCP server.&nbsp;&nbsp;

54
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,680
Then, when it asked the server for an IP address&nbsp;
again, it asked to receive the same address again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

55
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,040
If this address was no longer available, my PC&nbsp;
would have been assigned a different address.&nbsp;&nbsp;

56
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:46,320
However, the address was available, so my PC got&nbsp;
its preferred IP address. Here’s an important part&nbsp;&nbsp;

57
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:53,760
of DHCP, the lease time. IPCONFIG /ALL displays&nbsp;
what time the lease was obtained, and what time&nbsp;&nbsp;

58
00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:00,880
it will expire. What exactly does this mean?&nbsp;
DHCP servers ‘lease’ IP addresses to clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;

59
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,960
These leases are usually not permanent, and the&nbsp;
client must give up the IP address at the end of&nbsp;&nbsp;

60
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,640
the lease. A client can also release the address&nbsp;
before the lease is up, if it no longer needs it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

61
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,640
Now, I said ‘usually’ not permanent, because&nbsp;
it is possible to configure the DHCP server&nbsp;&nbsp;

62
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,240
to permanently assign IP addresses. However,&nbsp;
it’s almost always best to set a lease time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

63
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,520
For example, think about a cafe that provides&nbsp;
WiFi network access to its customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

64
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,440
If the IP address leases were permanent,&nbsp;
every time a new customer comes into the cafe&nbsp;&nbsp;

65
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,800
and connects to the WiFi, the customer’s devices&nbsp;
would be permanently assigned IP addresses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

66
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,280
unless the client device releases it. Or how about&nbsp;
an airport that provides WiFi? I think you can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

67
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,600
why it’s best to limit the lease time, to preserve&nbsp;
the available IP addresses. If the customer stays&nbsp;&nbsp;

68
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,400
longer than the lease time, their device will&nbsp;
simply automatically request a new IP address,&nbsp;&nbsp;

69
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,200
but if they stop using the network the IP&nbsp;
addresses will be free for someone else to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;

70
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,280
Okay, here at the bottom we can see some&nbsp;
other info my PC learned from the DHCP server.&nbsp;&nbsp;

71
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,840
The default gateway, DHCP server,&nbsp;
and DNS server are all 192.168.0.1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

72
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,280
which is my home router. This&nbsp;
is common in home networks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

73
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,280
the home router provides all of these&nbsp;
services to devices on the local network.

74
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,760
I want to demonstrate the process that a DHCP&nbsp;
client goes through to get an IP address from&nbsp;&nbsp;

75
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:38,080
a DHCP server, but first I need to make my PC&nbsp;
release its IP address, so it can ask the server&nbsp;&nbsp;

76
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:46,240
again. The command in the Windows command prompt&nbsp;
to release the DHCP-learned IP address is IPCONFIG&nbsp;&nbsp;

77
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:53,760
/RELEASE. Now no information is displayed for the&nbsp;
Ethernet0 interface. So, let me demonstrate what&nbsp;&nbsp;

78
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:01,440
just happened. My PC sent a DHCP Release message&nbsp;
to the DHCP server, my router, telling it that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

79
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:09,280
IP address isn’t needed anymore. So, 192.168.0.167&nbsp;
is now free to assign to another client.

80
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,920
I used Wireshark to capture&nbsp;
that DHCP release message.&nbsp;&nbsp;

81
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,640
For the CCNA you should focus on learning the four&nbsp;
message process used to lease an IP address from&nbsp;&nbsp;

82
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,560
a DHCP server, which I will show you next. But&nbsp;
let’s look at the DHCP release message anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

83
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,920
Of course, the message is an Ethernet frame so&nbsp;
here’s the Ethernet header. An IPv4 header is&nbsp;&nbsp;

84
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:43,520
inside, from source IP address 192.168.0.167, the&nbsp;
PC, to destination IP 192.168.0.1, the router.&nbsp;&nbsp;

85
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,680
Inside is a UDP header, and notice the&nbsp;
ports. Source port 68, destination port 67.&nbsp;&nbsp;

86
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:02,480
DHCP servers use UDP port 67 and DHCP clients use&nbsp;
UDP port 68. So, the source port is 68 because&nbsp;&nbsp;

87
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,960
it’s the DHCP client, and the destination&nbsp;
port is 67 because it’s the DHCP server.&nbsp;&nbsp;

88
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,320
This is different than DNS, for example, in&nbsp;
which only the port of the server is decided&nbsp;&nbsp;

89
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,480
and the client uses a random ephemeral port.&nbsp;
Finally, inside of the UDP segment we have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

90
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,360
DHCP release message. The client IP is indicated&nbsp;
here. And notice these ‘options’ down here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

91
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,560
DHCP has various options used for different&nbsp;
purposes. For example option 53, at the top,&nbsp;&nbsp;

92
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,600
indicates what kind of DHCP message it is. And&nbsp;
before moving on, let me point out my favorite&nbsp;&nbsp;

93
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,840
part of DHCP messages, the magic cookie. Do a&nbsp;
Google search if you want to learn about that one.

94
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,440
Now that I’ve released the IP address of&nbsp;
my PC, let’s take a look at how my PC can&nbsp;&nbsp;

95
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:03,040
get an IP address from the DHCP server. From the&nbsp;
Windows command prompt I used the command IPCONFIG&nbsp;&nbsp;

96
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,600
/RENEW. My PC contacts the DHCP server, and&nbsp;
now my PC has the same configuration as before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

97
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,000
This process involves four&nbsp;
messages, let me introduce them now.

98
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:21,840
The first message is the DHCP Discover message.&nbsp;
It is a broadcast message from the client.&nbsp;&nbsp;

99
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:28,000
Basically, it’s asking if there are any DHCP&nbsp;
servers in the local network, telling them it&nbsp;&nbsp;

100
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,400
needs an IP address. Let’s use Wireshark to take&nbsp;
a look at the DHCP Discover message my PC sent.

101
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:42,080
Here it is. Here’s the Ethernet header. Notice&nbsp;
the destination broadcast MAC address of all Fs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

102
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,120
My PC doesn’t know the IP address or MAC address&nbsp;
of the DHCP server. In fact it doesn’t even know&nbsp;&nbsp;

103
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,480
if there is a DHCP server on the network, so&nbsp;
it has no choice but to broadcast the message.&nbsp;&nbsp;

104
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,960
Here’s the IPv4 header. Notice&nbsp;
the source IP address of 0.0.0.0.&nbsp;&nbsp;

105
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:10,240
Basically, this means my PC doesn’t have an IP&nbsp;
address yet. The destination is 255.255.255.255,&nbsp;&nbsp;

106
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,280
so it’s a broadcast message. Once again,&nbsp;
since this is a message from the DHCP&nbsp;&nbsp;

107
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:23,600
client to the server, the source port is UDP&nbsp;
68 and the destination is UDP 67. And here’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

108
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,600
the actual DHCP message. You don’t need to know&nbsp;
the contents of any of these messages in detail,&nbsp;&nbsp;

109
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,480
just know their basic purpose. But here are a few&nbsp;
of the fields. First off, the ‘Bootp flags’ field.&nbsp;

110
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,800
Bootp is actually the predecessor of DHCP, but&nbsp;
you don’t need to learn Bootp for the CCNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

111
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,800
I just want to point out the value of ‘unicast’&nbsp;
here, represented by 0000. This may seem odd, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

112
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,560
message is broadcast but this field says unicast.&nbsp;
I’ll explain it when we look at the next message.&nbsp;&nbsp;

113
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:03,280
Then we can see here that the client IP&nbsp;
address is 0.0.0.0, since my PC doesn’t have&nbsp;&nbsp;

114
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:09,200
an IP address yet. The client MAC is also&nbsp;
displayed here. And here are the options,&nbsp;&nbsp;

115
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,160
notice they are different than the ones used in&nbsp;
the DHCP Release message we looked at before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

116
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:21,520
Let me just point out this option, Requested&nbsp;
IP Address. Because my PC previously had the IP&nbsp;&nbsp;

117
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:29,520
address 192.168.0.167, it requested that address&nbsp;
again. If the address is available, the server&nbsp;&nbsp;

118
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:35,520
might grant it that same IP address again. But if&nbsp;
it’s not, my PC would get a different IP address.&nbsp;&nbsp;

119
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,920
If this is the first time my PC is using DHCP&nbsp;&nbsp;

120
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,480
it won’t request an IP address like this, it&nbsp;
will simply leave it up to the server to decide.

121
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:52,640
The next message is the DHCP Offer message, it is&nbsp;
sent from the DHCP server to the client, offering&nbsp;&nbsp;

122
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:58,480
an address for the client to use, as well as other&nbsp;
information like default gateway, DNS server, etc.

123
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,920
So let’s check out the DHCP&nbsp;
Offer my router sent to my PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;

124
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,400
First off, notice the Offer is sent as a&nbsp;
unicast frame to the client’s MAC address,&nbsp;&nbsp;

125
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,680
since the server learned the client’s&nbsp;
MAC address from the Discover message.&nbsp;&nbsp;

126
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,840
It’s also unicast at Layer 3, the destination&nbsp;
is the IP address being offered to the client.&nbsp;&nbsp;

127
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,960
This time the source and destination port&nbsp;
number are reversed, since it’s a message&nbsp;&nbsp;

128
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:31,600
from the server to the client. The source&nbsp;
is UDP 67 and the destination is UDP 68.&nbsp;&nbsp;

129
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:38,400
And here’s the Offer message. Let’s look at&nbsp;
this field again, ‘Bootp flags’. Once again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

130
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:46,560
it says unicast. When my PC sent the DHCP Discover&nbsp;
message this field was also set to 0000, unicast.&nbsp;&nbsp;

131
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,920
This means that the server will send its messages&nbsp;
using unicast, as I just showed you above.&nbsp;&nbsp;

132
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,320
However, that’s not always the case. The DHCP&nbsp;
Offer message can be sent to the client using&nbsp;&nbsp;

133
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,800
either broadcast or unicast. It depends on the&nbsp;
client. In this case my PC told the router to send&nbsp;&nbsp;

134
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,440
the Offer using unicast, so it did. If my PC told&nbsp;
the router to send the Offer using broadcast, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

135
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:19,120
destination MAC of this message would be all F’s&nbsp;
and the destination IP would be 255.255.255.255.&nbsp;&nbsp;

136
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,280
At this point in the DHCP process, the&nbsp;
client’s IP address isn’t actually configured.&nbsp;&nbsp;

137
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,120
Some clients won’t accept unicast messages before&nbsp;
their IP address is actually configured, so that’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

138
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,840
why sometimes broadcast must be used instead of&nbsp;
unicast. And finally here are the options. For&nbsp;&nbsp;

139
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:44,560
example option 51 indicates the lease time, option&nbsp;
6 is ‘domain name server’ that’s the DNS server,&nbsp;&nbsp;

140
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,040
and option 3 is ‘router’, which tells the client&nbsp;
the default gateway. By the way, you don’t have&nbsp;&nbsp;

141
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:58,320
to memorize these option numbers, definitely not&nbsp;
at the CCNA level, I’m just pointing them out.

142
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,320
Okay, the next message is the DHCP Request&nbsp;
message. It is sent from the DHCP client&nbsp;&nbsp;

143
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,640
to the server, telling the server that it&nbsp;
wants to use the IP address it was offered.&nbsp;&nbsp;

144
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,160
This is important, there may be multiple&nbsp;
DHCP servers on the local network,&nbsp;&nbsp;

145
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,920
and all of them will reply to the&nbsp;
client’s Discover message with an Offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

146
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,880
So, the client has to tell which&nbsp;
server it is accepting the offer from&nbsp;&nbsp;

147
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:29,120
and request to use that IP address. Typically, the&nbsp;
client will accept the first Offer it receives.

148
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,360
Let’s look at that Request message in Wireshark.&nbsp;&nbsp;

149
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,880
The destination MAC is all Fs, so this&nbsp;
is once again a broadcast message.&nbsp;&nbsp;

150
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,080
If there are multiple DHCP servers on the&nbsp;
network, all of them will receive this&nbsp;&nbsp;

151
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,440
message. One of the later fields will indicate&nbsp;
which server the PC accepted the offer from.&nbsp;&nbsp;

152
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,880
The source IP is still 0.0.0.0, since the offered&nbsp;
IP address hasn’t actually been configured yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

153
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:05,360
The destination is broadcast, 255.255.255.255.&nbsp;
Since it’s a message from the client to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

154
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:13,280
server, the source port is UDP 68 and the&nbsp;
destination is UDP 67. And here’s the request&nbsp;&nbsp;

155
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:19,280
message. Here’s the flags field again, telling&nbsp;
the server to send its messages using unicast,&nbsp;&nbsp;

156
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,800
even though the client itself uses broadcast. And&nbsp;
here are the options for this Request message.&nbsp;&nbsp;

157
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,280
Notice that the server’s IP address is&nbsp;
indicated using option 54. If there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

158
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,720
multiple DHCP servers on the local network, this&nbsp;
is how the client says which server it selected.

159
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:45,280
Now the final message in the process, the DHCP&nbsp;
Ack, acknowledgement. This is sent from the server&nbsp;&nbsp;

160
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:51,520
to the client, confirming that the client may&nbsp;
use the requested IP address. Once this message&nbsp;&nbsp;

161
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,000
is received the client finally configures&nbsp;
the IP address on its network interface.

162
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,680
Here’s that Ack message in Wireshark.&nbsp;&nbsp;

163
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,000
Notice that these messages from the server to the&nbsp;
client are once again sent to unicast addresses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

164
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,160
not broadcast. Let me point out once&nbsp;
again that the server uses UDP port 67,&nbsp;&nbsp;

165
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,840
so that’s the source port, and the client uses&nbsp;
UDP port 68, so that’s the destination port.&nbsp;&nbsp;

166
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:25,040
And here’s the Ack message. The Bootp flags field&nbsp;
once again indicates unicast, because the client&nbsp;&nbsp;

167
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:32,880
requested unicast messages. Just like the DHCP&nbsp;
Offer message, the DHCP Ack message can be either&nbsp;&nbsp;

168
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,280
broadcast or unicast, depending on what the client&nbsp;
requests. And these are the options for this Ack&nbsp;&nbsp;

169
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:46,320
message. There are many different DHCP options, if&nbsp;
you want to check out a list, the DHCP Wikipedia&nbsp;&nbsp;

170
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,200
page lists a bunch of them, and a quick Google&nbsp;
search will give you many explanations of&nbsp;&nbsp;

171
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,800
their various functions. But that’s just&nbsp;
extra, not necessary for the CCNA exam.

172
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:06,240
Here’s a quick summary of that process. A common&nbsp;
way to remember the messages is D-O-R-A, DORA,&nbsp;&nbsp;

173
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:12,320
for Discover, Offer, Request, and Ack. Make&nbsp;
sure you know which messages are sent from&nbsp;&nbsp;

174
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,800
client to server, server to client, and also which&nbsp;
messages must be sent broadcast and which can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

175
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:25,520
sent either broadcast or unicast. Also, here’s&nbsp;
the Release message I showed first, it’s sent&nbsp;&nbsp;

176
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,920
unicast from the client to the server. There are&nbsp;
actually many more DHCP message types than these,&nbsp;&nbsp;

177
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,000
but if you know these message&nbsp;
types you’ll be ready for the CCNA.

178
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,840
Next let me introduce the concept of DHCP Relay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

179
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,080
Some network engineers might choose to&nbsp;
configure each router to act as the DHCP server&nbsp;&nbsp;

180
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:55,360
for its connected LANs. However, large enterprises&nbsp;
often choose to use a centralized DHCP server,&nbsp;&nbsp;

181
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,560
which will assign IP addresses to DHCP clients&nbsp;
in all subnets throughout the enterprise network.&nbsp;&nbsp;

182
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,280
If the server is centralized, it won’t receive&nbsp;
the DHCP clients’ broadcast DHCP messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;

183
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,800
Remember, broadcast messages don’t leave the local&nbsp;
subnet, routers don’t forward them. However to&nbsp;&nbsp;

184
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:21,680
fix this you can configure a router to act as a&nbsp;
‘DHCP relay agent’. If you do that, the router&nbsp;&nbsp;

185
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:28,160
will forward the clients’ broadcast DHCP messages&nbsp;
to the remote DHCP server as unicast messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;

186
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,880
Let me use this network to demonstrate. PC1&nbsp;
is a DHCP client, so it will broadcast a DHCP&nbsp;&nbsp;

187
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,560
Discover message to ask DHCP servers on the&nbsp;
local network to assign it an IP address.&nbsp;&nbsp;

188
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:50,880
However, in this case R1 isn’t a DHCP server.&nbsp;
SRV1 is the central DHCP server for this network,&nbsp;&nbsp;

189
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,240
so R1 will need to forward any&nbsp;
DHCP messages from PC1 to SRV1.

190
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,840
Let me demonstrate that visually. SRV1 is a&nbsp;
DHCP server, and R1 is a DHCP relay agent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

191
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:15,440
PC1 broadcasts a DHCP Discover message to get an&nbsp;
IP address. R1, a DHCP relay agent, relays the&nbsp;&nbsp;

192
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,920
message to SRV1. Notice that the source address&nbsp;
changes to the address of R1’s G0/1 interface,&nbsp;&nbsp;

193
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,840
and the destination is SRV1’s IP&nbsp;
address. So, it is a unicast message.&nbsp;&nbsp;

194
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:35,360
Then SRV1 replies with the DHCP Offer, sending&nbsp;
it to the address of R1’s G0/1 interface,&nbsp;&nbsp;

195
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:42,880
192.168.1.1. R1 then forwards it to&nbsp;
PC1. The source is R1’s IP address,&nbsp;&nbsp;

196
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:51,040
and the message is either sent unicast to PC1 or&nbsp;
broadcast. Then PC1 broadcasts a request message,&nbsp;&nbsp;

197
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:59,600
and R1 relays it to SRV1. Finally SRV1 replies&nbsp;
with a DHCP Ack, and R1 forwards that to PC1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

198
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,200
which configures the IP address it was&nbsp;
assigned, for example 192.168.1.100.&nbsp;&nbsp;

199
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,200
So, that’s a quick overview of how DHCP&nbsp;
relay agents work. It’s quite easy to&nbsp;&nbsp;

200
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,080
configure a DHCP relay agent, you just need&nbsp;
one command, and I’ll show you how to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

201
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,640
In the next section I’ll show you how to configure&nbsp;
DHCP. First, I’ll show you how to configure a&nbsp;&nbsp;

202
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:30,160
Cisco router as a DHCP server, and then how to&nbsp;
configure a Cisco router as a DHCP relay agent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

203
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,080
Finally I’ll show you how to configure&nbsp;
a Cisco router as a DHCP client.

204
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,360
So, let me show you how to configure a&nbsp;
Cisco router to function as a DHCP server.&nbsp;&nbsp;

205
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:50,680
Let’s use these two devices here, R1 and PC1. Here&nbsp;
are the commands. First up, you can use the IP&nbsp;&nbsp;

206
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:58,320
DCHP EXCLUDED-ADDRESS command to specify a range&nbsp;
of addresses that WON’T be given to DHCP clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;

207
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,800
These are addresses you want to reserve,&nbsp;
perhaps for network devices or servers in&nbsp;&nbsp;

208
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:08,880
the local subnet. The first address in the command&nbsp;
is the low end of the range, and then the second&nbsp;&nbsp;

209
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:17,520
is the top of the range. So, this reserves all&nbsp;
addresses from 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.10.&nbsp;&nbsp;

210
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,160
This command isn’t necessary, but it’s a good idea&nbsp;
to reserve some addresses which can be statically&nbsp;&nbsp;

211
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:31,920
assigned to servers, network devices, or whatever.&nbsp;
Then use the command IP DHCP POOL, followed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

212
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:40,560
the pool name, to create a DHCP pool. What is a&nbsp;
DHCP pool? It’s basically a subnet of addresses&nbsp;&nbsp;

213
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:46,880
that can be assigned to DHCP clients, as well as&nbsp;
other info such as DNS server and default gateway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

214
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,840
You should create a separate DHCP pool for each&nbsp;
network the router is acting as a DHCP server for.&nbsp;&nbsp;

215
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:03,680
In this case R1 is only acting as the DHCP server&nbsp;
for 192.168.1.0/24, so I only need to create one&nbsp;&nbsp;

216
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,280
pool. Here’s where you actually configure the&nbsp;
range of addresses to be assigned to clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;

217
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,680
The command is NETWORK, followed by the network&nbsp;
address and then either the network mask or prefix&nbsp;&nbsp;

218
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:24,880
length. So, you can write /24 or 255.255.255.0,&nbsp;
either works. So, I told R1 to assign addresses&nbsp;&nbsp;

219
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,960
from 192.168.1.0/24 to clients, although it&nbsp;
won’t assign the addresses I reserved above.&nbsp;&nbsp;

220
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,840
Then you can configure the DNS server&nbsp;
that clients in the network should use.&nbsp;&nbsp;

221
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:44,560
So, in this case R1 would tell PC1 to use Google’s&nbsp;
DNS server at 8.8.8.8 for its DNS queries.&nbsp;&nbsp;

222
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:52,000
You can also configure the domain name of the&nbsp;
network. In this case R1 will tell PC1 that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

223
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,160
is part of the domain ‘jeremysitlab.com’.&nbsp;
Then there’s the DEFAULT-ROUTER command.&nbsp;&nbsp;

224
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:06,160
What’s this? It’s the default gateway. So, R1 will&nbsp;
tell clients to use its address, 192.168.1.1, as&nbsp;&nbsp;

225
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:14,960
their default gateway. You can also configure the&nbsp;
lease time. I specified 0 5 30, which is 0 days,&nbsp;&nbsp;

226
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,600
5 hours, and 30 minutes. You can also enter LEASE&nbsp;
INFINITE, although as I have said before that’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

227
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:28,720
not recommended. So, when PC1 comes online&nbsp;
and sends its DHCP Discover message, perhaps&nbsp;&nbsp;

228
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,320
it will be assigned .11, the first available&nbsp;
address since .1 through .10 are reserved.

229
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,600
Let’s confirm. Here’s a really useful command&nbsp;
on a Cisco router acting as a DHCP server,&nbsp;&nbsp;

230
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:49,600
SHOW IP DHCP BINDING. It shows all of the DHCP&nbsp;
clients that are currently assigned IP addresses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

231
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:58,880
Here’s PC1, with an IP address of 192.168.1.11.&nbsp;
Its MAC address is also displayed, and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

232
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,440
lease expiration date and time, and the binding&nbsp;
type. DHCP bindings can be manually configured,&nbsp;&nbsp;

233
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,680
but we didn’t do that in this&nbsp;
case. So let’s check on PC1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

234
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,720
Here’s the domain name, jeremysitlab.com. Here’s&nbsp;
the IP address and subnet mask it was assigned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

235
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,360
Here we can see when the lease was&nbsp;
obtained and when it will expire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

236
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:28,640
Notice that the lease period is 5 hours and 30&nbsp;
minutes, as I configured. The lease expiration&nbsp;&nbsp;

237
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,600
times on PC1 and R1 are different, but that’s&nbsp;
just because I didn’t configure the time zone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

238
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,480
And finally we can see the&nbsp;
default gateway, DHCP server,&nbsp;&nbsp;

239
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,240
and DNS server. So, we successfully&nbsp;
configured R1 as a DHCP server.

240
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:51,440
Now, how about DHCP relay agent configuration?&nbsp;
Here’s that same network as before,&nbsp;&nbsp;

241
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,320
SRV1 is a DHCP server and R1 will be a&nbsp;
DHCP relay agent after we configure it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

242
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:05,280
To configure it as a relay agent, first enter&nbsp;
interface config mode for the interface connected&nbsp;&nbsp;

243
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:13,680
to the client devices. PC1 is connected to R1’s&nbsp;
g0/1, so we will configure that interface. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

244
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:19,840
all you need is one command, IP HELPER-ADDRESS,&nbsp;
followed by the IP address of the DHCP server.&nbsp;&nbsp;

245
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,720
Of course, make sure R1 actually&nbsp;
has a route to the DHCP server.&nbsp;&nbsp;

246
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,200
If it doesn’t have a route, configure a static&nbsp;
route or use a dynamic routing protocol like OSPF.&nbsp;&nbsp;

247
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:38,960
After configuring that I checked the interface&nbsp;
with SHOW IP INTERFACE G0/1. Notice that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

248
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:47,120
‘helper address’ is listed here, 192.168.10.10,&nbsp;
which is SRV1. And that’s it, that’s all you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

249
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:54,800
to do to configure a router as a DHCP relay agent.&nbsp;
IP HELPER-ADDRESS, then the DHCP server address.

250
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,440
Okay, one last thing you need to be able to&nbsp;
configure for the CCNA. A Cisco router can&nbsp;&nbsp;

251
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,520
be a DHCP client, meaning it can use DHCP to&nbsp;
configure the IP address of its interfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;

252
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,960
This is rare, as I mentioned earlier usually&nbsp;
network devices will be configured with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

253
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:20,080
fixed IP address. However here’s how you&nbsp;
can do it. Let’s make R2 a DHCP client&nbsp;&nbsp;

254
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:28,240
on its G0/1 interface. From interface config&nbsp;
mode for G0/1, use the command IP ADDRESS DHCP.&nbsp;&nbsp;

255
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:37,760
That’s it, now R2 will broadcast a DHCP Discover&nbsp;
message and get an IP address from SRV1. Indeed&nbsp;&nbsp;

256
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:45,600
it did, I checked with SHOW IP INTERFACE G0/1.&nbsp;
It states clearly, ‘address determined by DHCP’.&nbsp;&nbsp;

257
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,560
Note that its G0/0 interface is still&nbsp;
manually configured, its not a DHCP client.

258
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,200
Here’s a summary of the commands&nbsp;
we covered in this video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

259
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,400
A couple commands for the Windows command prompt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

260
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:07,520
then Cisco IOS commands to configure a DHCP&nbsp;
server, a DHCP relay agent, and a DHCP client.&nbsp;&nbsp;

261
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,920
If you don’t remember any of these commands, go&nbsp;
back in the video to review. You can also get&nbsp;&nbsp;

262
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,400
practice with some of these commands in today’s&nbsp;
practice lab, which will be in the next video.

263
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,240
Before moving on to the quiz, let’s&nbsp;
review what we covered in this video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

264
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,960
First, I introduced the purpose of DHCP. It&nbsp;
allows devices to automatically learn various&nbsp;&nbsp;

265
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,400
configuration parameters, such as their IP&nbsp;
address, subnet mask, default gateway, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;

266
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:44,480
I introduced the basic functions of DHCP. Make&nbsp;
sure you remember DORA, Discover, Offer, Request,&nbsp;&nbsp;

267
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,400
and Ack. You should also know the basic&nbsp;
purpose and functions of a DHCP relay agent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

268
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,200
Finally I showed you how to&nbsp;
configure DHCP in Cisco IOS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

269
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,720
First, how to configure a Cisco router as a DHCP&nbsp;
server, then a DHCP relay agent, and finally a&nbsp;&nbsp;

270
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:09,120
DHCP client. Make sure to watch until the end&nbsp;
of the quiz for a bonus question from Boson&nbsp;&nbsp;

271
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:16,640
Software’s ExSim for CCNA, the best practice exams&nbsp;
for the CCNA. Okay, let’s go to quiz question 1.

272
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,840
What is the correct order of messages when a&nbsp;
DHCP client gets an IP address from a server?&nbsp;&nbsp;

273
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,840
Here are the options. Pause the&nbsp;
video to think about the answer.

274
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:38,480
The answer is B, Discover, Offer, Request, Ack.&nbsp;
If you’re having trouble remembering the order,&nbsp;&nbsp;

275
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,120
remember D-O-R-A, DORA.&nbsp;
Okay, let’s go to question 2.

276
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,640
Which of the following Windows command prompt&nbsp;
commands will cause a PC to broadcast a DHCP&nbsp;&nbsp;

277
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,840
Discover message? Here are the options.&nbsp;
Pause the video to think about the answer.

278
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:06,320
The answer is D, IPCONFIG /RENEW. This will&nbsp;
cause the PC to send a DHCP Discover message&nbsp;&nbsp;

279
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,440
to get an IP address from any&nbsp;
DHCP servers it can reach.&nbsp;&nbsp;

280
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:16,480
C, IPCONFIG /RELEASE will make the&nbsp;
PC send a DHCP Release message,&nbsp;&nbsp;

281
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:23,600
to release its current IP address. A and B are&nbsp;
not real commands. Okay, let’s go to question 3.

282
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:33,680
Examine the following DHCP Offer message that&nbsp;
SRV1 sent to R2. What destination IP address&nbsp;&nbsp;

283
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:39,120
did SRV1 send it to? Here are the options.&nbsp;
Pause the video to select the correct answer.

284
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:50,320
The answer is D, 255.255.255.255. How can&nbsp;
we know this from this output, even though&nbsp;&nbsp;

285
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:56,560
I didn’t show the IP header? It’s here, the&nbsp;
broadcast flag in the Bootp flags field is set.&nbsp;&nbsp;

286
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:03,520
In the previous examples, this field was unicast,&nbsp;
so the server would send unicast messages to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

287
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:09,520
client. However in this case it is broadcast, so&nbsp;
the server will broadcast messages to the client.&nbsp;&nbsp;

288
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:18,320
Therefore, the destination IP address is&nbsp;
255.255.255.255. Okay, let’s go to question 4.

289
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:27,520
Which of the following DHCP messages can be sent&nbsp;
using unicast? (select all that apply) Here are&nbsp;&nbsp;

290
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:32,880
the options. Note that this includes messages&nbsp;
that can be sent either unicast or broadcast,&nbsp;&nbsp;

291
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,160
as well as messages that are always sent unicast.&nbsp;
Okay, pause the video to think about the answers.

292
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:49,360
The answers are A, DHCP Ack, C,&nbsp;
DHCP Release, and E, DHCP Offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

293
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,160
A and E are messages sent from&nbsp;
the DHCP server to the client,&nbsp;&nbsp;

294
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,840
and they can be sent using unicast if the&nbsp;
client indicates it in the ‘bootp flags’ field.&nbsp;&nbsp;

295
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:07,760
C is sent by a DHCP client to its DHCP server, to&nbsp;
tell the server it no longer needs its IP address.&nbsp;&nbsp;

296
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:15,920
It is sent unicast. B and D are always broadcast&nbsp;
messages. Okay, let’s go to question 5.

297
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:24,400
In which of the following situations would you&nbsp;
configure a router as a DHCP relay agent? Here&nbsp;&nbsp;

298
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:29,760
are the options. Read them carefully, and&nbsp;
select the best answer. Pause the video now.

299
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:40,880
Okay the answer is A, when the router is&nbsp;
not a DHCP server, there are DHCP clients&nbsp;&nbsp;

300
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,600
in the router’s connected LAN, and there is&nbsp;
no other DHCP server in the connected LAN.&nbsp;&nbsp;

301
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,040
B, C, and D do not require the router to&nbsp;
be a DHCP relay agent. Okay, that’s all&nbsp;&nbsp;

302
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:59,120
for the quiz. Now let’s take a look at a bonus&nbsp;
question in Boson Software’s ExSim for CCNA.

303
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,520
Okay here's today's Boson ExSim practice question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

304
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:10,240
You are the administrator for the network&nbsp;
shown above. DHCP services for the network&nbsp;&nbsp;

305
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:16,800
are provided by the DHCP server on NetworkB.&nbsp;
DHCP services are not running on the routers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

306
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,680
Which of the following commands should you&nbsp;
issue to enable clients on NetworkA to receive&nbsp;&nbsp;

307
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:27,840
IP addresses from the DHCP server? Select the&nbsp;
best answer. Okay, so these are the options.&nbsp;&nbsp;

308
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:34,480
IP HELPER-ADDRESS commands, so which router&nbsp;
should you use the command on, and what should&nbsp;&nbsp;

309
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,600
be the IP address you enter in the command? Okay,&nbsp;
pause the video now to think about your answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

310
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,680
Okay let's check. So, these clients&nbsp;
here in NetworkA are DHCP clients,&nbsp;&nbsp;

311
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:57,120
or they want to be DHCP clients. So they&nbsp;
need to access the DHCP server here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

312
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:04,960
So they will broadcast DHCP Discover messages&nbsp;
which RouterA will receive. Now, RouterA is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

313
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:14,160
a DHCP server, but we have to configure it as a&nbsp;
DHCP relay agent. So, among the answers, C, D,&nbsp;&nbsp;

314
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:19,840
and F have you issuing the command on RouterA.&nbsp;
So the correct answer is one of these three.&nbsp;&nbsp;

315
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,840
Okay, so what should be the IP address? The&nbsp;
command is IP HELPER-ADDRESS, and then the IP&nbsp;&nbsp;

316
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:36,880
address of the DHCP server. So that is 10.10.3.5,&nbsp;
therefore the answer should be F. So let's check.&nbsp;&nbsp;

317
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,040
And that is correct. So, you can&nbsp;
read Boson's explanation down here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

318
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:51,360
including some explanation about the IP&nbsp;
HELPER-ADDRESS command, it's not only for DHCP.&nbsp;&nbsp;

319
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,160
Okay and that's Boson's explanation, and they&nbsp;
have a reference here to some Cisco documentation&nbsp;&nbsp;

320
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,080
about the IP HELPER-ADDRESS command.&nbsp;&nbsp;

321
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,160
Okay so that's Boson ExSim for the CCNA.&nbsp;
These are without a doubt the best practice&nbsp;&nbsp;

322
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,240
exams for the CCNA, and they're the&nbsp;
ones I used to get my certification.&nbsp;&nbsp;
