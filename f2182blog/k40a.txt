lab we will take a look at some aspects

of syslog you have surely seen syslog

messages as you configure routers and

switches some syslog messages inform you

of things like interfaces being enabled

and disabled others indicate major

problems with the device which can

render it unfunctional you can configure

these messages to be displayed in real

time on the CLI and also to be stored in

RAM or in a server for later reference

there are 8 levels of severity from

level 0

aka emergency to level 7 aka debug make

sure you learn all eight severity levels

for your exam okay let's get started

step 1 is to connect to our ones console

port using PC 2 to do so in packet

tracer click on PC 2 click desktop then

terminal and accept these defaults ok

now we are in the CLI for our one let's

shut down and then enable the g00

interface and then check the syslog

messages enable call 40 interface g00

shutdown yeah we got a couple messages

already

now let's enable it no shutdown so what

is the severity level of these messages

that is indicated by the number 5 here

level 5 is aka informational meaning

these aren't critical messages which

require urgent attention now we are

instructed to enable date and time

stamps for these messages without time

stamps these logging messages aren't

very helpful when you look back at them

at a later time exit to enable these

date and time stamps use this command

service timestamps log date time m/sec

four milliseconds

now let's shut down and enable the

interface again interface g00 shutdown

no shutdown we've got the same messages

but now there are date and time stamps

at the beginning the three zero one

indicates March first by the way as I

haven't configured the date on our one

okay step two is to configure an enable

secret of CCNA and then configure the

vty lines for telnet exit enable secret

CCNA now let's configure the vty lines

line vty 0 15 password CCENT login

transport input telnet next let's telnet

from pc1 to our ones g00 interface

telnet 192.168.1.1 the vty line password

is CCENT okay we're in r1 an able

password of CCNA compte now let's try to

generate some syslog messages here by

enabling an unused interface note that

since I'm connecting to r1 via the g00

interface if I shut down that interface

the tongue at connection would of course

cut off so let's use g0 one interface g0

one no shutdown and no message appears

if you go back to our console connection

on PC 2 however a syslog message

appeared that's because by default

syslog messages are not displayed over

the vty lines let's change that type end

to go back to a privileged exec mode

then use this command terminal monitor

that should enable syslog messages to

the vty lines

conf T interphase G 0 1 now let's shut

it down shut down there we go now the

message is displayed over telnet as well

as over the console connection exit the

next step is to configure synchronous

logging on the console and vty lines now

what exactly is synchronous logging well

it's a little difficult to recreate on

packet tracer but without it enabled if

you are typing something into the CLI

and a syslog message appears the syslog

message appears right in the middle of

what you're typing and it becomes very

difficult to read your commands if we

enable synchronous logging if a syslog

message appears in the middle of you

typing a command iOS will then rewrite

the command on a new line below the

syslog message so you can read it

clearly before finishing and entering

the command just make sure you know this

command for the test so to enable it

let's go first to the console line line

con 0 then we just use a single command

logging synchronous that's it now let's

do it on the vty lines also line vty 0

15 logging synchronous exit that's it

the next step is to enable logging to

the buffer this stores logging messages

in RAM for you to view later if I enter

do show logging you can see buffer

logging is disabled let's enable it with

this command logging buffered do show

logging now as you can see down here the

default size of this buffer is 4096

bytes let's double the size to 8000 192

bytes logging buffered 8 1 9 to do show

logging there we go

finally let's configure our one to send

syslog messages to our server server one

this is a really good idea as the

logging messages in the buffer disappear

if you shut down the device and you also

don't want to take up a bunch of RAM

space with logging messages so an

external syslog server is valuable to

configure this we can either enter

logging followed by the IP address of

the server or logging host followed by

the IP 192.168.1.1 hundred there we go

do show logging there it is logging to

192.168.1.1 hundred let's shut and no

shut an interface and then check on

server one interface g0 one shut no show

now to check messages on a syslog server

on packet tracer click the server click

services then click syslog here on the

left in this lab we took a look at some

aspects of syslog that's all for this
