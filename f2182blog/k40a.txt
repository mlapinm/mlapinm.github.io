lab we will take a look at some aspects
of syslog 24.085375 you have surely seen syslog
messages as you configure routers and
switches 28.368937 some syslog messages inform you
of things like interfaces being enabled
and disabled 34.323228 others indicate major
problems with the device which can
render it unfunctional 38.717623 you can configure
these messages to be displayed in real
time on the CLI and also to be stored in
RAM or in a server for later reference
48.235706 there are 8 levels of severity from
level 0
aka emergency to level 7 aka debug 57.002768 make
sure you learn all eight severity levels
for your exam 60.068601 okay let's get started
62.887663 step 1 is to connect to our ones console
port using PC 2 69.034725 to do so in packet
tracer click on PC 2 click desktop then
terminal and accept these defaults 77.616245 ok
now we are in the CLI for r1 81.466453 let's
shut down and then enable the g00
interface and then check the syslog
messages 87.783765 enable conf t interface g00
93.781723 shutdown 95.422223 yeah we got a couple messages
already
now let's enable it 99.127389 no shutdown 101.042159 so what
is the severity level of these messages
104.814096 that is indicated by the number 5 here
108.377512 level 5 is aka informational meaning
these aren't critical messages which
require urgent attention 115.729762 now we are
instructed to enable date and time
stamps for these messages 120.071741 without time
stamps these logging messages aren't
very helpful when you look back at them
at a later time 126.433470 exit to enable these
date and time stamps use this command
132.200157 service timestamps log date time m/sec
four milliseconds
138.519615 now let's shut down and enable the
interface again 142.755407 interface g00 shutdown
no shutdown 148.493177 we've got the same messages
but now there are date and time stamps
at the beginning 154.099032 the three zero one
indicates March first by the way as I
haven't configured the date on our one
160.501282 okay step two is to configure an enable
secret of CCNA and then configure the
vty lines for telnet 169.324677 exit enable secret
CCNA 174.743468 now let's configure the vty lines
178.093530 line vty 0 15 password CCENT login
transport input telnet 188.238425 next let's telnet
from pc1 to our ones g00 interface
194.486654 telnet 192.168.1.1 the vty line password
is CCENT 207.442029 okay we're in r1 209.403966 enable
password of CCNA conf t 215.282611 now let's try to
generate some syslog messages here by
enabling an unused interface 220.444298 note that
since I'm connecting to r1 via the g00
interface if I shut down that interface
the tongue at connection would of course
cut off so let's use g0 one 230.749610 interface g0
one no shutdown 235.384193 and no message appears
238.038463 if you go back to our console connection
on PC 2 however a syslog message
appeared 243.931380 that's because by default
syslog messages are not displayed over
the vty lines 249.506504 let's change that 251.569317 type end
to go back to a privileged exec mode
255.893046 then use this command 258.207671 terminal monitor
260.303004 that should enable syslog messages to
the vty lines
263.858545 conf T interphase G 0 1 now let's shut
it down 270.358170 shut down 271.720629 there we go now the
message is displayed over telnet as well
as over the console connection 278.435524 exit the
next step is to configure synchronous
logging on the console and vty lines 286.201357 now
what exactly is synchronous logging 289.024273 well
it's a little difficult to recreate on
packet tracer but without it enabled 294.359627 if
you are typing something into the CLI
and a syslog message appears 298.128752 the syslog
message appears right in the middle of
what you're typing 302.261481 and it becomes very
difficult to read your commands 304.870356 if we
enable synchronous logging if a syslog
message appears in the middle of you
typing 310.947522 a command iOS will then rewrite
the command on a new line below the
syslog message 316.338772 so you can read it
clearly before finishing and entering
the command 320.678209 just make sure you know this
command for the test 324.847542 so to enable it
let's go first to the console line line
con 0 330.323229 then we just use a single command
333.261645 logging synchronous 335.466311 that's it now let's
do it on the vty lines also 339.891644 line vty 0
15 343.325435 logging synchronous exit that's it
347.744539 the next step is to enable logging to
the buffer 352.356373 this stores logging messages
in RAM for you to view later 356.391977 if I enter
do show logging you can see buffer
logging is disabled 362.603956 let's enable it with
this command 365.130789 logging buffered 367.415872 do show
logging now as you can see down here the
default size of this buffer is 4096
bytes 376.583955 let's double the size to 8000 192
bytes 380.310475 logging buffered 8 1 9 2 do show
logging 387.711912 there we go
finally let's configure our one to send
syslog messages to our server server one
397.160745 this is a really good idea as the
logging messages in the buffer disappear
if you shut down the device 403.139870 and you also
don't want to take up a bunch of RAM
space with logging messages so an
external syslog server is valuable 410.024974 to
configure this we can either enter
logging followed by the IP address of
the server or logging host followed by
the IP 421.334349 192.168.1.100 424.509203 there we go
do show logging 427.701182 there it is logging to
192.168.1.100 434.069910 let's shut and no
shut an interface and then check on
server one 438.360077 interface g0 one shut no show
443.930493 now to check messages on a syslog server
on packet tracer click the server click
services 452.985264 then click syslog here on the
left 455.199722 in this lab we took a look at some
aspects of syslog 460.143889 that's all for this
