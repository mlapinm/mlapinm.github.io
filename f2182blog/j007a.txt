Thanks for your help. Let’s get started.
22.630
In this lab we will examine some network traffic using packet tracer’s ‘simulation mode’ feature.
28.169
But first, let’s take a look at the network diagram.
32.619
There are two routers, R1 and R2, two switches, SW1 and SW2, and one server and one pc.
41.390
The G0/0, G0/1, G0/2 and F0/1 labels indicate the network interfaces used to connect the devices.
53.420
G means gigabit ethernet, so these interfaces operate at a speed of one gigabit per second.
60.890
You migth also see it written as Gi, or Gig, but I usually just use G. F means fastethernet,
69.840
so these interfaces operate at 100 megabits per second.
74.100
You might also see it written as Fa, instead of just F. Now these two series of numbers
80.600
here, 192.168.1.0/24, and 10.0.0.0/24, are the network addresses.
92.140
Routers are used to connect different networks.
95.280
There are two networks displayed here in this diagram, the one on the left here includes
99.700
SRV1, PC1, SW1, SW2, and R1’s G0/0 interface.
107.819
They are all in a single network, or subnet, a term you will learn about soon.
112.880
So, that’s the 192.168.1.0/24 network, and the .100 for SRV1 means that its IP address
124.469
is 192.168.1.100, and the .1 by R1 means that its address is 192.168.1.1.
134.830
Wait for the lesson about IP addresses coming up soon for more information on this topic.
140.500
The other network is 10.0.0.0/24, consisting of R1’s G0/1 interface, and R2’s G0/0 interface.
148.940
Notice the .1 and .2, so R1 is 10.0.0.1 and R2 is 10.0.0.2.
160.470
Hopefully that helps you understand a little bit about how to read a network diagram.
164.810
Don’t worry if you have no idea how IP addresses work, or what that /24 next to the network
170.960
addresses means, that will all be explained in a video coming soon.
174.850
So let’s get started on today’s main topic.
178.030
I’m going to use packet tracer’s simulation mode, which you can activate here, in the bottom right.
184.500
Now, I can click through here, and you can see various network traffic being sent around.
190.760
Let’s take a look at some.
194.480
At Device SW2 means that SW2 is the one sending out the data.
200.300
It says type, STP.
202.820
STP is the spanning-tree protocol, a layer 2 protocol you’ll learn a lot about in this
209.200
course. Let's click on it, and
212.260
notice here the 7 layers of the OSI model, and STP has information in the bottom two layers.
219.340
Let’s look at the Layer 2 header.
223.250
Notice it says Layer 2: IEEE 802.3 header.
228.960
You might remember that IEEE 802.3 is the standard number for Ethernet, so this is an
235.020
Ethernet Layer 2 header.
237.150
Let’s look at some of the information here.
240.790
Down here it shows some information about the process, and notice here at number
244.930
2: the device encapsulates the PDU into an Ethernet frame.
250.150
There’s the encapsulation process I talked about in the lecture video.
254.370
Let’s take a look at the Layer 1 info.
258.440
Notice that the information is the two interfaces that it sends the frame out of.
264.190
Information like the physical ports, or interfaces, on a device are Layer 1 information, because
269.420
it is the physical layer.
271.590
Now let’s look at another bit of network traffic, this time AT device R1, and the type is OSPF.
281.870
OSPF is a layer 3 protocol, it’s used to discover the best paths to different networks.
289.880
You’ll learn a lot about it, too, in this course.
293.410
STP only had Layer 2 and Layer 1 information, but OSPF has Layer 3, Layer 2, and Layer 1 information.
303.470
Notice in the Layer 3 header, source IP address, and destination IP address.
309.620
Remember, IP addresses are Layer 3 information.
314.240
Next, to look at some traffic that includes information all the way up to Layer 7, I will go on PC1.
321.660
Pc1 is using a protocol called DHCP to automatically receive an IP address.
330.040
To generate some DHCP traffic, and DHCP is a layer 7 protocol, I’ll get PC1 to release
337.240
its current IP address, and then renew it.
341.500
When you click on a PC in packet tracer you’ll see this screen.
346.190
Click on desktop, then command prompt, to access the PC’s command prompt, which functions
351.230
like a windows command prompt.
354.050
Type ipconfig, and you can see the current IP address here…...to release the IP address, type ipconfig /release.
365.850
And now you can see already a DHCP message on PC1.
369.680
I’ll type the next command to, to renew the IP address. It’s ipconfig /renew.
377.770
Now let’s check one of these DHCP messages.
382.060
Notice information all the way up to Layer 7, except layers 5 and 6.
387.169
That's because in the TCP/IP model, which is the model actually in use, Layers 5, 6,
394.520
and 7 are all combined into a single layer called the application layer, so you’re
398.760
not going to see any layer 5 or 6 information, but you can consider it to be part of the layer 7 information.
407.280
Then there is layer 4 information, if you click on it, it says the device encapsulates the PDU into a UDP
414.919
segment, remember the Layer 4 PDU is called a segment.
419.250
Layer 3, Layer 2, and Layer 1 information is present as well.
423.600
Now, if I just press the play button in the middle, it will slowly play through all of
428.990
the different messages being sent through the network.
432.650
That’s all for this lab, I just wanted to show you the OSI and TCP/IP models at work on a network.
442.229
Your understanding of the functions of these layers might still be a little unclear, but trust me,
447.669
you’ll understand things better as we start to actually learn about these different protocols
451.360
that operate at each layer.
