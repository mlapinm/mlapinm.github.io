6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,019
Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:21,919
Also, remember to sign up via the link in
the description to get all of the lab files

8
00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:26,970
for this course, so you can try it out yourself
in packet tracer.

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,249
If you want more labs like these, I highly
recommend picking up Boson’s NetSim for

10
00:00:31,249 --> 00:00:35,149
the CCNA, click the link in the video description
to check it out.

11
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:39,680
It’s a network simulator like packet tracer,
but it’s even better, and it includes all

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,719
of these guided labs to not only help you
get hands-on practice configuring and troubleshooting,

13
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,820
but also deepen your understanding of the
exam topics.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,269
I used it myself when studying for my certifications,
so I feel confident about recommending it

15
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:55,949
to all of you.

16
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:01,429
If you want to get your own copy of NetSim,
please follow the link in the video description.

17
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:06,340
In this lab we will configure OSPF in the
same network as last time, using the new configurations

18
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,960
we learned in the lecture video.

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,840
For the purpose of this video I have already
completed steps 1 and 2, which involves configuring

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,060
host names and IP addresses.

21
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,730
It’s good to get some repetitive practice
with the basics, but to keep the length of

22
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,640
this video a little shorter I won’t show
these steps in the video.

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,220
So, let’s get right into step 3.

24
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,240
We are told to enable OSPF directly on each
interface of the routers.

25
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,170
That means we won’t be using the NETWORK
command to enable OSPF on interfaces with

26
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,210
an IP address that falls in the specified
range.

27
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,960
Instead we will specify exactly which interfaces
to enable OSPF on, directly on the interfaces.

28
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,910
I’ll start on R1.

29
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:59,650
ENABLE CONF T. I’ll use the INTERFACE RANGE
command to configure the interfaces all at

30
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,780
once.

31
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,710
Note that there is no need to enable OSPF
on G3/0, the other routers don’t need to

32
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:12,810
know about the 203.0.113.0/30 network, as
I explained in the Day 26 lab video.

33
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:21,080
So, INTERFACE RANGE G0/0, F1/0, L0.

34
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,140
Notice how I enter the INTERFACE RANGE command.

35
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:31,920
If configuring a range like G0/0, G0/1, G0/2,
G0/3, for example, you can use the command

36
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,450
INTERFACE RANGE G0/0 – 3, with a hyphen.

37
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,641
However, in cases like this with three different
types of interface, FastEthernet, Gigabit

38
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:47,640
Ethernet, and Loopback, you can use a comma
in between each to configure them all at once.

39
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,100
Now let’s enable OSPF.

40
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:55,100
IP OSPF 1, that’s the process-ID, AREA 0.

41
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,360
And that’s it.

42
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,430
Let’s confirm.

43
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,000
DO SHOW IP PROTOCOLS.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,580
So, in the lecture video I showed you that
the ‘Routing for Networks’ section is

45
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,990
empty and instead the interfaces are displayed
under ‘Routing on Interfaces Configured

46
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,000
Explicitly’.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,680
However, that doesn’t display in Packet
Tracer.

48
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,880
As I’ve said before, Packet Tracer is a
great, free tool for the CCNA, but it’s

49
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,450
not perfect.

50
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,069
This is just a small thing, but I just wanted
to point it out.

51
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:27,819
Now let’s configure Loopback0 as a passive
interface.

52
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:32,000
To do so, we have to go into OSPF configuration
mode.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,400
ROUTER OSPF 1.

54
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,650
I showed you the PASSIVE-INTERFACE DEFAULT
command in the lecture, but we’re just configuring

55
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,290
a single interface so I’ll use the regular
method.

56
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,700
PASSIVE-INTERFACE L0.

57
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,020
Okay, now I’ll just run through the configurations
on the other routers.

58
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,980
R2 next.

59
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,459
ENABLE.

60
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:02,520
CONF T. INTERFACE RANGE G0/0, F1/0, L0.

61
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,180
IP OSPF 1 AREA 0.

62
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,880
Then configure the passive interface.

63
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,970
ROUTER OSPF 1.

64
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,180
PASSIVE-INTERFACE L0.

65
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,280
Next up, R3.

66
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,829
ENABLE.

67
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:28,380
CONF T. INTERFACE RANGE F1/0, F2/0, L0.

68
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,270
IP OSPF 1 AREA 0.

69
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,800
ROUTER OSPF 1.

70
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,139
PASSIVE-INTERFACE L0.

71
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,580
Finally, R4.

72
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,260
ENABLE.

73
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:53,940
CONF T. INTERFACE RANGE G0/0, F1/0, F2/0,
L0.

74
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,680
IP OSPF 1 AREA 0.

75
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:04,139
Here on R4 I’ll try out the PASSIVE-INTERFACE
DEFAULT command, and then remove it from F1/0

76
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,240
and F2/0.

77
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,759
ROUTER OSPF 1.

78
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,199
PASSIVE-INTERFACE DEFAULT.

79
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,479
Notice the message saying the neighbor has
changed to the DOWN state.

80
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:21,139
OSPF can’t make any OSPF neighbors via a
passive interface, so the neighbor goes down

81
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:22,139
immediately.

82
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:28,749
Okay, let’s enable OSPF again on F1/0 and
F2/0.

83
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:32,650
NO PASSIVE-INTERFACE F1/0.

84
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,100
NO PASSIVE-INTERFACE F2/0.

85
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,849
Let’s see if only G0/0 and L0 are passive
interfaces.

86
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:44,080
DO SHOW IP PROTOCOLS.

87
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,279
Indeed they are.

88
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:50,240
If the router had any other network interfaces,
they would appear here as well, however this

89
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:57,400
router only has G0/0, F1/0, F2/0, and the
loopback interface I created.

90
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Now let’s check R4’s OSPF neighbors.

91
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,169
DO SHOW IP OSPF NEIGHBOR.

92
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:10,610
Looks good, R4 is neighbors with R2 and R3.

93
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,110
Notice the dead time.

94
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,460
If I keep repeating this command over and
over again, you should be able to see that

95
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:22,349
the dead time counts down to 30 and then resets,
because a Hello message is received every

96
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,139
10 seconds.

97
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:29,740
Okay, that’s all for step 3, let’s do
step 4.

98
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,400
Configure the reference bandwidth on each
router so a fastethernet interface has a cost

99
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,999
of 100.

100
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:40,379
I hope you can complete this step, this sounds
like something that could appear on the exam.

101
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:43,419
Let’s check out the command.

102
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:48,159
AUTO-COST REFERENCE-BANDWIDTH, and let’s
use the question mark.

103
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:52,310
So, remember that this command is entered
in megabits per second.

104
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:57,270
So, how can we make it so a fastethernet interface
has a cost of 100?

105
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:03,749
Well, a fastethernet interface has a bandwidth
of 100 megabits per second by default.

106
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:10,069
The formula for OSPF cost is reference bandwidth
divided by interface bandwidth equals cost.

107
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:14,469
So, what divided by 100 equals 100?

108
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:16,159
The answer is 10,000.

109
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:21,740
So, enter 10,000 as the reference bandwidth,
and let’s check.

110
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,180
DO SHOW IP OSPF INTERFACE.

111
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,889
In the lecture I showed you the SHOW IP OSPF
INTERFACE BRIEF command, but it’s not available

112
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:32,379
in Packet Tracer.

113
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:38,400
So, here’s FastEthernet1/0, and notice the
cost of 100.

114
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,520
If a fastethernet interface has a cost of
100, then what will the cost of G0/0 be?

115
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,619
Scroll up, and here it is, 10.

116
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:51,729
So, a 10-gig interface, or anything faster
than that, will have a cost of 1.

117
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:55,910
Okay, let’s configure that on the other
routers.

118
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,169
Remember that it’s always a good idea to
configure the same reference bandwidth on

119
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:00,369
each router.

120
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:02,550
R3 next.

121
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:08,059
AUTO-COST REFERENCE-BANDWIDTH 10000.

122
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:10,860
Then R2.

123
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,539
AUTO-COST REFERENCE-BANDWIDTH 10000.

124
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:17,389
Finally, R1.

125
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:22,149
AUTO-COST REFERENCE-BANDWIDTH 10000.

126
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:27,449
Next up we’ll configure a default route
on R1 and advertise it to the other OSPF routers.

127
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:33,620
Since I’m in OSPF config mode, let’s configure
R1 to advertise it first, even though it doesn’t

128
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,969
have a default route yet.

129
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:38,860
DEFAULT-INFORMATION ORIGINATE.

130
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,919
Now let’s configure the route.

131
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,130
EXIT.

132
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:49,930
IP ROUTE 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0, and then the Internet
Service Provider Router’s IP address will

133
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:54,430
be the next hop, 203.0.113.2.

134
00:08:54,430 --> 00:09:00,290
Now I’m going to go on R4 to check which
default route or routes it added.

135
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:06,610
In the day 26 lab video it added routes via
both R2 and R3, even though the route via

136
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:12,089
R2 has a faster gigabit ethernet connection,
so it is the better route.

137
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:16,610
Now that we have changed the OSPF reference
bandwidth, fastethernet and gigabit ethernet

138
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,089
interfaces have a different cost.

139
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:24,699
So, what default route or routes will be added
by R4, and what will their cost be?

140
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:26,480
Let’s check.

141
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,100
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

142
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,009
So, what I’m going to explain now is a more
advanced OSPF topic.

143
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:36,500
You don’t need to remember it for the CCNA.

144
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,430
But I want to give a brief explanation in
case some of you notice this and think OSPF

145
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,440
is behaving strangely.

146
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,000
First off, notice that R4 added the route
via R2 to the route table.

147
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,740
You might think that’s correct, because
we changed the reference bandwidth so that

148
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,529
fastethernet and gigabit ethernet interfaces
have a different cost.

149
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:02,060
That means the route via R2 is preferred over
R3.

150
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,690
However, this is actually another error in
Packet Tracer.

151
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,170
BOTH routes, via R2 and via R3, should be
added.

152
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,170
Why is that?

153
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,030
Well, look at the cost of this route via R2.

154
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,240
The cost is 1.

155
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,920
With the reference bandwidth we just configured,
the cost to reach R2 should be 100, plus 10

156
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,269
for R2 to reach R1, so 110 just to get to
R1.

157
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:31,320
Why is the cost of this default route 1?

158
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,560
The answer is here, this ‘E2’ beside the
route.

159
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:43,360
If you look up at the top here for the meaning
of E2, it says ‘OSPF external type 2’.

160
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,670
As I said, this is a CCNP-level topic, so
you don’t need to learn it right now.

161
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:54,220
But basically the ‘external type 2’ means
that the ‘internal’ OSPF metric to reach

162
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,750
R1 is ignored.

163
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:01,250
So, actually the cost via both R2 and R3 will
be the same, 1.

164
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:10,000
To prove that, I’ll shut down R4’s F1/0
interface so the OSPF adjacency with R2 goes down

165
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,880
INTERFACE F1/0.

166
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,279
SHUTDOWN.

167
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,690
We get a message saying the neighbor has gone
from FULL to DOWN.

168
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,540
I’ll click this button to skip forward 30
seconds to make sure R4 has updated the routing

169
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,060
table.

170
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,509
And let’s check.

171
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:27,769
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

172
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:35,700
See, now the route via R3, 10.0.34.1, is added,
and it also has a cost of 1.

173
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:41,420
So, for some reason Packet Tracer does not
insert both routes at the same time.

174
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:46,529
Perhaps Packet Tracer’s logic is considering
the internal OSPF metric to reach R1 even

175
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:52,360
though it shouldn’t, but if you try this
in GNS3 or on real equipment you’ll see

176
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,899
that both routes are added to the routing
table.

177
00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:00,079
Anyway, like I said this is a CCNP topic,
don’t worry about learning it yet.

178
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,860
I won’t cover this topic in my CCNA course
so if you do want to learn more, try a Google

179
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,279
search for ‘OSPF external metric’.

180
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:19,480
Finally, let’s go into simulation mode and
take a look at an OSPF Hello message.

181
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,920
Let’s check out this one.

182
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,089
Look at the Layer 3 destination, 224.0.0.5.

183
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:29,139
Do you remember that IP address?

184
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:35,240
That’s the multicast address used to reach
all OSPF routers on the link, and it’s the

185
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,449
IP address that routers send OSPF hello messages
to.

186
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:44,519
Now, if you click on the ‘PDU Details’
up here, you can see the different fields

187
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,519
in the frame.

188
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,519
There’s the Ethernet frame, the IP packet,
and inside is the OSPF Hello message.

189
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,601
I won’t go into any details, but let’s
look at some of the fields of the OSPF Hello

190
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:58,310
message.

191
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,319
First notice that the version number is 2.

192
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:06,200
As I said before, this is the version that
is usually used for IPv4.

193
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,790
Next to that, Type 1.

194
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,050
What’s that?

195
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:13,930
Well, it means this is a ‘Type 1’ OSPF
message, a Hello message.

196
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:19,850
Remember, Hello is type 1, DBD is Type 2,
etc.

197
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:25,620
Under you can see the Router ID, and notice
the Area ID is written as 0.0.0.0.

198
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:32,829
Well, OSPF Areas are a 32-bit number, like
an IPv4 address, and can be written in dotted

199
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:34,060
decimal like this.

200
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:39,829
So, Area 0 can be written as 0.0.0.0.

201
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:44,480
Going down a bit, you can see the network
mask, the default Hello and Dead timers of

202
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:51,589
10 and 40 seconds, DR and BDR addresses, and
the neighbor’s address.

203
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:54,440
Okay, just wanted to point out a few fields.

204
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,430
Actually, one more field.

205
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:00,880
Look here at the ‘pro’, protocol field
of the IP header.

206
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,680
0x59, what does that mean?

207
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,879
Didn’t I say that OSPF messages have a protocol
number of 89?

208
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:15,680
Well, 0x59 means hexadecimal 5 9, which is
actually equal to 89 in decimal, indicating

209
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,579
an OSPF message is encapsulated in the IP
header.

210
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:24,630
Okay, so in this lab we configured OSPF in
a different way than the last lab, changed

211
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:29,480
the reference bandwidth, advertised a default
route, and took a brief look at some fields

212
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,160
of the OSPF Hello message.

213
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,130
That’s all for this lab.

214
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:38,189
Now let’s take a look at a lab in Boson
NetSim for CCNA.

215
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:45,009
Okay, for today's Boson NetSim lab preview
I have selected OSPF 2.

216
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:49,410
So you can pause the video if you want to
read the objective and get an idea of the

217
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,579
scenario.

218
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:55,690
But basically there is a new router that has
been added to the network, 'Key West', and

219
00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:02,220
we have to configure OSPF here, and also troubleshoot
OSPF elsewhere in the network.

220
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,860
These are the commands you need to know, you
already know all of these commands, so that

221
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,670
shouldn't be a problem.

222
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,290
And the IP addresses on each device.

223
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,470
Okay, now let's look at the lab tasks.

224
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,399
There are three main tasks.

225
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,660
Task 1, examine the initial network configuration.

226
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,069
Task 2, examine the remainder of the topology.

227
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:28,339
And task 3, verify network connectivity.

228
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:33,860
So, for today's lab preview let's just do
task 1.

229
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,740
So once again, you can pause the video here
if you want to read about the scenario, but

230
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,449
I'll get right into step A, part 1.

231
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:45,529
Log on to the Key West router.

232
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:49,879
Okay, so I'll click on the Key West router
here, console.

233
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:51,920
Now I'm in the CLI.

234
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,649
Notice it says right here, all passwords have
been set to cisco.

235
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:59,690
So first we have to log in to the device,
cisco.

236
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:04,910
And then enable, and once again enter the
enable password, cisco.

237
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:10,350
Okay, what command should you issue to display
the routing table on Key West?

238
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:15,850
That's easy, SHOW IP ROUTE.

239
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,709
Examine the output of this command.

240
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:22,639
What conclusion can you draw regarding the
operation of the OSPF routing protocol on

241
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,129
Key West?

242
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:30,100
Okay, so if OSPF is running, it doesn't seem
to be configured correctly because it isn't

243
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,490
receiving any OSPF routes from neighbors.

244
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:38,649
Okay, part B, examine the configuration.

245
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:43,399
What command should you issue to display the
currently executing configuration on Key West?

246
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:47,509
So, the currently executing configuration,
that is the running config.

247
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:54,439
So the command is SHOW RUNNING-CONFIG.

248
00:16:54,439 --> 00:17:01,209
So let's check for any OSPF configuration,
here it is.  Router OSPF 1.

249
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:05,610
There is the router ID, and one NETWORK command.

250
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,670
Okay, step 2.

251
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,440
Review the information you have gathered so
far.

252
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,700
Is the OSPF routing protocol running on Key
West?

253
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,180
How did you determine this?

254
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,340
Well, yes it is running.

255
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:25,690
As you can see here, there is some OSPF configuration,
and if I do SHOW IP PROTOCOLS, yes you can

256
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,630
see OSPF is indeed running.

257
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,550
Okay, step 3.

258
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:35,640
If OSPF is running on Key West, what would
prevent OSPF from detecting the other networks

259
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,850
in the topology?

260
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:42,490
Okay, so I did notice something that could
be a problem, this NETWORK command.

261
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:49,330
0.0.0.0, that's /32 so it matches only 200.120.45.0.

262
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:54,170
Only that one single address, which I believe
is not on any of Key West's interfaces.

263
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:58,640
Let's see, SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.

264
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,200
And indeed it isn't.

265
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:06,310
So this network command does not activate
OSPF on any of the interfaces.

266
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:12,450
Okay step 4, in order for OSPF to send and
receive updates from its neighbors the appropriate

267
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,320
router interfaces must be configured for OSPF.

268
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,280
Examine the configuration and determine whether
this has been done.

269
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,250
What command is missing or configured incorrectly?

270
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,920
Okay, so I just answered that.

271
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,090
The NETWORK command is configured incorrectly.

272
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:33,130
Okay, step C, or part C, step 1.

273
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,490
Examine the information that you have gathered
so far.

274
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,460
Briefly explain the main problem and how you
plan to correct the configuration error you

275
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,610
have found.

276
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:45,220
Okay, so I just explained that, the incorrect
wildcard mask here.

277
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:53,100
So, in order to enable OSPF on these interfaces
let's configure the network command with a

278
00:18:53,100 --> 00:19:01,030
/24 mask, so NETWORK 200.120.45.0 and then
a /24 mask, that's nice and simple.

279
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,760
CONF T. ROUTER OSPF 1.

280
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,450
First I will remove the incorrect command,
DO SHOW RUN, PIPE (|), and then here's a convenient

281
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:17,020
way to filter the output, SECTION OSPF.

282
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:21,890
So now I only see the OSPF configurations
in the running config.

283
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:28,570
NO NETWORK 200.120.45.0, AREA 0.

284
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:33,250
Okay, now let's configure a new network command.

285
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:46,330
NETWORK 200.120.45.0 and a /24 wildcard mask
is 0.0.0.255 AREA 0.

286
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:51,190
Okay, so I corrected the configuration error.

287
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,600
Then part D is 'verify OSPF behavior'.

288
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,680
After you correct the configuration error
you have discovered, reexamine the routing

289
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,060
table on Key West.

290
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,600
What change do you observe?

291
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,180
So, I'll get out of OSPF config mode with
END.

292
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,260
SHOW IP ROUTE.

293
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,950
Okay, I do not notice any changes.

294
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,980
Oh, looks like a neighbor just came up, let's
see.

295
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,260
Okay, no routes yet.

296
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,260
I'll just check a few more times.

297
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,690
Sometimes it can take a little time for the
routes to enter the routing table.

298
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,120
There they are.

299
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:35,130
Okay, looks like the Key West router has formed
an OSPF adjacency with, which router was it?

300
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,160
With the Miami router.

301
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,160
Let's see.

302
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,060
SHOW IP OSPF NEIGHBOR.

303
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:46,680
Indeed, .246, here it is, .246 Miami.

304
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:52,500
Okay, so it formed the OSPF neighbor relationship,
the OSPF adjacency, and now it is receiving

305
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,000
OSPF routes from the Miami router.

306
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,290
Okay, so if you want to try the other steps
in this lab make sure to get a copy of Boson

307
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,390
NetSim for yourself.

308
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,860
I highly recommend it.

309
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:08,260
If you want to get a copy, follow the link
in the video description.

310
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:13,540
Before finishing today’s video I want to
thank my JCNP-level channel members.

311
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,130
Recently I’ve noticed an increase in the
number of channel members, and I’m so thankful

312
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,820
to all of you, both JCNA and JCNP-level members.

313
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,650
Previously I read out the names of all the
JCNP-level members one by one, but the list

314
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,190
is getting longer so I’ll just leave the
list up here.

315
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:34,570
Your support helps me keep making and releasing
these videos every week, I’m really grateful

316
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,550
for your support.

317
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:42,150
This is the list of JCNP-level members at
the time of recording by the way, August 15th

318
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:46,310
2020, if you signed up recently and your name
isn’t on here don’t worry, you’ll be

319
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,070
