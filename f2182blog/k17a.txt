practice lab you can download the lab

file from the link in the description in

this lab we will take a look at port

security port security is a security

function which can be configured on

switch interfaces and controls which MAC

addresses are allowed on which

interfaces MAC addresses are 48 bit

addresses which are tied to the physical

device such as a network interface card

on a computer port security allows us to

ensure that only the intended devices

are allowed to communicate over a given

switchboard we will do a few labs to

practice port security in this first lab

let's look at and configure some basic

functions of port security on two

switches switch 1 and switch 2 which

each have one pc connected to them try

to complete the lab yourself first then

continue watching this video if you have

trouble or watch it after to check your

solution

step1 tells us to find the MAC address

of switch to by using the CLI of switch

one and the reverse so let's go on

switch one first enable use the command

show MAC address - table to display the

list of known MAC addresses on the

switch switch one knows one

MAC address it's type is dynamic meaning

that we didn't manually configure this

MAC address it was learned by receiving

a packet on the port displayed here

fastethernet 0/1 that's the MAC address

of switch - now let's go on switch to

enable show MAC address table this here

is the MAC address of switch 1 learned

dynamically on the fastethernet 0/1 port

step 2 asks us why the MAC addresses of

pc1 & pc2 don't appear in the MAC

address table even though switch 1 and

switch to appear in each other's tables

if you have studied spanning tree

protocol already you know that switches

send each other BPD use bridge protocol

data units at regular intervals the

switches learned each other's MAC

addresses via these bpdu packets however

no traffic has passed from the PCs to

the switches yet so they are unaware of

the PCs MAC addresses at this point

step3 tells us to ping between the PCs

and then check the MAC address tables of

the switches if we ping between the PCs

switch one should have one dynamically

learned MAC address on his Fast Ethernet

0 to port that of PC 1 and to

dynamically learned MAC addresses on his

fastethernet 0/1 port those of switch 2

and PC 2 likewise switch 2 should have

one dynamically learned MAC address on

his Fast Ethernet 0 to port that of PC 2

and to dynamically learned MAC addresses

on its fastethernet 0/1 port those of

switch one and pc 1 so I'll go on PC 1

and ping PC to ping 192.168.1.2 elv

there we go now let's go on switch 1

show MAC address table here is the MAC

address of switch 2 we saw before this

other mac address on fastethernet 0/1

must be PC twos and the MAC address on

Fast Ethernet 0 2 must be PC ones let's

check on switch to also show MAC address

table here switch ones MAC address this

one is also on Fast Ethernet 0 1 so it

must be PC ones and this MAC address

went on Fast Ethernet 0 2 must be PC

twos

step four is to enable port security on

the switch interfaces connected to PCs

so fastethernet 0 2 of each switch in

this lab we will configure the switches

so that switch 1 only accepts traffic

from PC 1 on its Fast Ethernet 0 2

interface and switch 2 only accepts

traffic from PC 2 on its Fast Ethernet 0

2 interface first you must enable it at

the interface level let's go on switch 1

again count 50 interface f02 you can

enable port security with the command

switch port port security but command

rejected Fast Ethernet 0 2 is a dynamic

port what does this mean well one rule

of port security is that it can't be

enabled on a trunk port

it can only be enabled on an access port

although this switch port is currently

functioning as an access port it's

actually in dynamic mode meaning that if

it were to be connected to a switch port

configured as a trunk it would start

functioning as a trunk the switch board

has to be explicitly configured as an

access port if you want to enable port

security on it so switch port mode

access switch port port security that's

it let's go on switch to now compte

interface f02 switch port mode access

switch port port security that's all you

have to do to initially configure port

security

Step five first asks us how many MAC

addresses are allowed on a port security

interface by default

well let's use a show command to find

out since we're already on switch to

let's start here do show port security

look here next to fast ethernet zero to

the max secure address count is 1

remember that for the test that is the

default number of MAC addresses allowed

on the switchboard because this is the

default we don't technically have to

configure this however it's often a good

idea to configure important settings

like this just to be sure and for our

purposes it's good to go through the

motions to practice so use this command

switch port port security maximum one

now let's do it on switch 1 to switch

port port security maximum 1 that's all

for step 5

step six asks us another question what

is the default action in the event of a

port security violation of course when

we configure port security there has to

be some action that the switch takes in

the event that the rules we configured

are violated there are three

possibilities

the first is protect which drops traffic

from any MAC addresses which are not

allowed on the port that's it it doesn't

shut down the interface or display any

messages it doesn't even increase the

violation counter that the switch keeps

the second option is restrict which

again drops all traffic from MAC

addresses which aren't allowed it also

displays a message on the switch and

increases the violation counter on the

switch the third one is shut down which

puts the switchboard into an error

disabled state effectively shutting down

the interface as well as increasing the

violation counter make sure you know the

differences between these three for the

test now as for which one is the default

we can use the same command as before do

show port security here at the end under

security action it says shutdown so

there's our answer the default port

security violation action is shut down

another thing to remember for the test

again even though this is default let's

go through the command to configure it

switch port port security violation now

I'll use the question mark to show you

the options here are the three options I

mentioned earlier protect restrict

shutdown let's go with the default of

shutdown now on switch to switch port

port security violation shutdown

the steps are all complete but I want to

show one more thing let me ping from pc1

to pc2 again ping 192.168.1 12 now I'll

go on switch 1 and show port security

address as you can see this command

shows the MAC address of PC 1 which

switch one has dynamically added as a

secure MAC address on Fast Ethernet 0 -
