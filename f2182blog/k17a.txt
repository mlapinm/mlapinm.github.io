welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab 4.699289you can download the lab

file from the link in the description 8.152395in

this lab we will take a look at port

security 14.009599port security is a security

function which can be configured on

switch interfaces and controls which MAC

addresses are allowed on which

interfaces 23.040544MAC addresses are 48 bit

addresses which are tied to the physical

device such as a network interface card

on a computer 32.017483port security allows us to

ensure that only the intended devices

are allowed to communicate over a given

switchboard 39.973917we will do a few labs to

practice port security 44.447202in this first lab

let's look at and configure some basic

functions of port security on two

switches switch 1 and switch 2 53.28906which

each have one pc connected to them 56.580272try

to complete the lab yourself first then

continue watching this video if you have

trouble or watch it after to check your

solution
65.655241
step1 tells us to find the MAC address

of switch 2 by using the CLI of switch

one and the reverse 75.967893so let's go on

switch one first 78.431218enable use the command

show MAC address - table 84.380305to display the

list of known MAC addresses on the

switch 87.886113switch one knows one

MAC address 91.045349it's type is dynamic meaning

that we didn't manually configure this

MAC address 96.694927it was learned by receiving

a packet on the port displayed here

fastethernet 0/1 101.493692that's the MAC address

of switch 2 104.168739now let's go on switch 2
106.370292
enable show MAC address table 111.772827this here

is the MAC address of switch 1 115.436638learned

dynamically on the fastethernet 0/1 port
119.407023
step 2 asks us why the MAC addresses of

pc1 & pc2 124.908151don't appear in the MAC

address table even though switch 1 and

switch to appear in each other's tables
129.945294
if you have studied spanning tree

protocol already 134.28383you know that switches

send each other BPD use bridge protocol

data units at regular intervals 140.832676the

switches learned each other's MAC

addresses via these bpdu packets 145.726325however

no traffic has passed from the PCs to

the switches yet 150.575194so they are unaware of

the PCs MAC addresses at this point
157.617874
step3 tells us to ping between the PCs

and then check the MAC address tables of

the switches 163.540997if we ping between the PCs

switch one should have one dynamically

learned MAC address on his Fast Ethernet

0 2 port that of PC 1 173.224295and to

dynamically learned MAC addresses on his

fastethernet 0/1 port 177.64034those of switch 2

and PC 2 180.232471likewise switch 2 should have

one dynamically learned MAC address on

his Fast Ethernet 0 to port that of PC 2

and to dynamically learned MAC addresses

on its fastethernet 0/1 port 192.59796those of

switch one and pc 1 so I'll go on PC 1
195.063391
and ping PC 2 198.70861ping 192.168.1.12
206.507604
there we go 208.4092now let's go on switch 1
210.962676
show MAC address table 215.263024here is the MAC

address of switch 2 we saw before 218.586529this

other mac address on fastethernet 0/1

must be PC twos 224.579024and the MAC address on

Fast Ethernet 0 2 must be PC ones 228.828553let's

check on switch 2 also 232.508461show MAC address

table 237.095771here switch ones MAC address 240.169557this

one is also on Fast Ethernet 0 1 242.472752so it

must be PC ones 244.94482and this MAC address

went on Fast Ethernet 0 2 must be PC

twos
250.006647
step four is to enable port security on

the switch interfaces connected to PCs
257.555683
so fastethernet 0 2 of each switch 260.565966in

this lab we will configure the switches

so that switch 1 only accepts traffic

from PC 1 on its Fast Ethernet 0 2

interface 269.669942and switch 2 only accepts

traffic from PC 2 on its Fast Ethernet 0

2 interface 274.372972first you must enable it at

the interface level 279.143081let's go on switch 1

again 281.146321 conf t  interface f02 286.681028you can

enable port security with the command

switch port port security 292.514561but command

rejected Fast Ethernet 0 2 is a dynamic

port 298.154059what does this mean 300.076423well one rule

of port security is that it can't be

enabled on a trunk port
304.979246
it can only be enabled on an access port
307.715738
although this switch port is currently

functioning as an access port 312.249528it's

actually in dynamic mode 314.07877meaning that if

it were to be connected to a switch port

configured as a trunk 318.593697it would start

functioning as a trunk 320.614636the switch board

has to be explicitly configured as an

access port if you want to enable port

security on it 327.059255so switch port mode

access 330.479739switch port port security 333.329003that's

it 334.967179let's go on switch to now 337.153457
conf t

interface f02 342.877647switch port mode access
345.410618
switch port port security 348.367851that's all you

have to do to initially configure port

security
352.069008
Step five first asks us how many MAC

addresses are allowed on a port security

interface by default
360.922013
well let's use a show command to find

out 364.090269since we're already on switch to

let's start here 367.590037do show port security
371.052023
look here next to fast ethernet zero 2
374.375812
the max secure address count is 1
377.251818
remember that for the test 379.574617
that is the

default number of MAC addresses allowed

on the switchboard 383.859935because this is the

default we don't technically have to

configure this 389.278041however it's often a good

idea to configure important settings

like this just to be sure 394.529272and for our

purposes it's good to go through the

motions to practice 398.200707so use this command
400.627074
switch port port security maximum one
404.61179
now let's do it on switch 1 2 407.692691switch

port port security maximum 1 413.597907that's all

for step 5
415.554281
step six asks us another question 420.566403what

is the default action in the event of a

port security violation 425.403929of course when

we configure port security there has to

be some action that the switch takes in

the event that the rules we configured

are violated 433.673372there are three

possibilities
436.351025
the first is protect 
438.567464
which drops traffic

from any MAC addresses which are not

allowed on the port 443.268101that's it it doesn't

shut down the interface or display any

messages 448.258578it doesn't even increase the

violation counter that the switch keeps
452.163884
the second option is restrict 455.362967which

again drops all traffic from MAC

addresses which aren't allowed 459.479384it also

displays a message on the switch and

increases the violation counter on the

switch 463.852395the third one is shut down 468.093768which

puts the switchboard into an error

disabled state effectively shutting down

the interface as well as increasing the

violation counter 475.972885make sure you know the

differences between these three for the

test 480.200904now as for which one is the default

we can use the same command as before 485.355473do

show port security 488.480845here at the end under

security action it says shutdown 493.830381so

there's our answer 496.035242the default port

security violation action is shut down
499.762644
another thing to remember for the test
502.717647
again even though this is default let's

go through the command to configure it
507.384602
switch port port security violation 511.645665now

I'll use the question mark to show you

the options 514.422873here are the three options I

mentioned earlier protect restrict

shutdown 519.33388let's go with the default of

shutdown 522.377044now on switch 2 525.418085switch port

port security violation shutdown
530.725256
the steps are all complete 535.754121but I want to

show one more thing 537.849143let me ping from pc1

to pc2 again 540.805393ping 192.168.1.12 545.294897now I'll

go on switch 1 548.308731and show port security

address 553.169438as you can see this command

shows the MAC address of PC 1 558.08966which

switch one has dynamically added as a

secure MAC address on Fast Ethernet 0 2
