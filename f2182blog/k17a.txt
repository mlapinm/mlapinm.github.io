in this lab we will take a look at port security
14.009599
port security is a security function which can be configured on switch interfaces and controls which MAC addresses are allowed on which interfaces
23.040544
MAC addresses are 48 bit addresses which are tied to the physical device such as a network interface card on a computer
32.017483
port security allows us to ensure that only the intended devices are allowed to communicate over a given switchboard
39.973917
we will do a few labs to practice port security
44.447202
in this first lab let's look at and configure some basic functions of port security on two switches switch 1 and switch 2
53.28906
which each have one pc connected to them
56.580272
try to complete the lab yourself first then continue watching this video if you have trouble or watch it after to check your solution
65.655241
step1 tells us to find the MAC address of switch 2 by using the CLI of switch one and the reverse
75.967893
so let's go on switch one first
78.431218
enable use the command show MAC address - table
84.380305
to display the list of known MAC addresses on the switch
87.886113
switch one knows one MAC address
91.045349
it's type is dynamic meaning that we didn't manually configure this MAC address
96.694927
it was learned by receiving a packet on the port displayed here fastethernet 0/1
101.493692
that's the MAC address of switch 2
104.168739
now let's go on switch 2
106.370292
enable show MAC address table
111.772827
this here is the MAC address of switch 1
115.436638
learned dynamically on the fastethernet 0/1 port
119.407023
step 2 asks us why the MAC addresses of pc1 & pc2
124.908151
don't appear in the MAC address table even though switch 1 and switch to appear in each other's tables
129.945294
if you have studied spanning tree protocol already
134.28383
you know that switches send each other BPD use bridge protocol data units at regular intervals
140.832676
the switches learned each other's MAC addresses via these bpdu packets
145.726325
however no traffic has passed from the PCs to the switches yet
150.575194
so they are unaware of the PCs MAC addresses at this point
157.617874
step3 tells us to ping between the PCs and then check the MAC address tables of the switches
163.540997
if we ping between the PCs switch one should have one dynamically learned MAC address on his Fast Ethernet 0 2 port that of PC 1
173.224295
and to dynamically learned MAC addresses on his fastethernet 0/1 port
177.64034
those of switch 2 and PC 2
180.232471
likewise switch 2 should have one dynamically learned MAC address on his Fast Ethernet 0 to port that of PC 2 and to dynamically learned MAC addresses on its fastethernet 0/1 port
192.59796
those of switch one and pc 1 so I'll go on PC 1
195.063391
and ping PC 2
198.70861
ping 192.168.1.12
206.507604
there we go
208.4092
now let's go on switch 1
210.962676
show MAC address table
215.263024
here is the MAC address of switch 2 we saw before
218.586529
this other mac address on fastethernet 0/1 must be PC twos
224.579024
and the MAC address on Fast Ethernet 0 2 must be PC ones
228.828553
let's check on switch 2 also
232.508461
show MAC address table
237.095771
here switch ones MAC address
240.169557
this one is also on Fast Ethernet 0 1
242.472752
so it must be PC ones
244.94482
and this MAC address went on Fast Ethernet 0 2 must be PC twos
250.006647
step four is to enable port security on the switch interfaces connected to PCs
257.555683
so fastethernet 0 2 of each switch
260.565966
in this lab we will configure the switches so that switch 1 only accepts traffic from PC 1 on its Fast Ethernet 0 2 interface
269.669942
and switch 2 only accepts traffic from PC 2 on its Fast Ethernet 0 2 interface
274.372972
first you must enable it at the interface level
279.143081
let's go on switch 1 again
281.146321
conf t interface f02
286.681028
you can enable port security with the command switch port port security
292.514561
but command rejected Fast Ethernet 0 2 is a dynamic port
298.154059
what does this mean
300.076423
well one rule of port security is that it can't be enabled on a trunk port
304.979246
it can only be enabled on an access port
307.715738
although this switch port is currently functioning as an access port
312.249528
it's actually in dynamic mode
314.07877
meaning that if it were to be connected to a switch port configured as a trunk
318.593697
it would start functioning as a trunk
320.614636
the switch board has to be explicitly configured as an access port if you want to enable port security on it
327.059255
so switch port mode access
330.479739
switch port port security
333.329003
that's it
334.967179
let's go on switch to now
337.153457
conf t interface f02
342.877647
switch port mode access
345.410618
switch port port security
348.367851
that's all you have to do to initially configure port security
352.069008
Step five first asks us how many MAC addresses are allowed on a port security interface by default
360.922013
well let's use a show command to find out
364.090269
since we're already on switch to let's start here
367.590037
do show port security
371.052023
look here next to fast ethernet zero 2
374.375812
the max secure address count is 1
377.251818
remember that for the test
379.574617
that is the default number of MAC addresses allowed on the switchboard
383.859935
because this is the default we don't technically have to configure this
389.278041
however it's often a good idea to configure important settings like this just to be sure
394.529272
and for our purposes it's good to go through the motions to practice
398.200707
so use this command
400.627074
switch port port security maximum one
404.61179
now let's do it on switch 1 2
407.692691
switch port port security maximum 1
413.597907
that's all for step 5
415.554281
step six asks us another question
420.566403
what is the default action in the event of a port security violation
425.403929
of course when we configure port security there has to be some action that the switch takes in the event that the rules we configured are violated
433.673372
there are three possibilities
436.351025
the first is protect
438.567464
which drops traffic from any MAC addresses which are not allowed on the port
443.268101
that's it it doesn't shut down the interface or display any messages
448.258578
it doesn't even increase the violation counter that the switch keeps
452.163884
the second option is restrict
455.362967
which again drops all traffic from MAC addresses which aren't allowed
459.479384
it also displays a message on the switch and increases the violation counter on the switch
463.852395
the third one is shut down
468.093768
which puts the switchboard into an error disabled state effectively shutting down the interface as well as increasing the violation counter
475.972885
make sure you know the differences between these three for the test
480.200904
now as for which one is the default we can use the same command as before
485.355473
do show port security
488.480845
here at the end under security action it says shutdown
493.830381
so there's our answer
496.035242
the default port security violation action is shut down
499.762644
another thing to remember for the test
502.717647
again even though this is default let's go through the command to configure it
507.384602
switch port port security violation
511.645665
now I'll use the question mark to show you the options
514.422873
here are the three options I mentioned earlier protect restrict shutdown
519.33388
let's go with the default of shutdown
522.377044
now on switch 2
525.418085
switch port port security violation shutdown
530.725256
the steps are all complete
535.754121
but I want to show one more thing
537.849143
let me ping from pc1 to pc2 again
540.805393
ping 192.168.1.12
545.294897
now I'll go on switch 1
548.308731
and show port security address
553.169438
as you can see this command shows the MAC address of PC 1
558.08966
which switch one has dynamically added as a secure MAC address on Fast Ethernet 0 2
563.979211
that's all for this lab
