Welcome to Jeremy’s IT Lab.
3.830
This is a complete course for the CCNA, including everything you need to pass the exam, all 100% free.
11.990
Make sure you stay tuned till the end of the video for the quiz to test your knowledge
15.740
of the material in this video.
18.240
Also, remember to download and use the Anki flashcards with the link in the description,
23.900
which will help you very much in your studies. Let’s get started.
29.119
In this fourth lesson, we will finally get started actually configuring some Cisco devices.
35.320
This lesson is about the Cisco IOS CLI.
39.500
Cisco IOS is the operating system used on Cisco devices, like Windows on a PC, or macOS on an imac.
47.629
Keep in mind, Cisco’s IOS is not related to Apple’s iOS for iPhones.
54.199
Now, what is a CLI?
57.629
CLI stands for command-line interface.
61.079
It’s the interface you use to configure Cisco devices, like routers, switches, and firewalls.
68.630
Here’s an image of the Cisco IOS CLI.
72.729
The color scheme can be changed, this is just the default color scheme with the software
76.790
I used when taking this screenshot.
79.280
Now, there is also something called a GUI, which means graphical user interface.
85.229
Here’s an example of a Cisco GUI, from Cisco’s ASDM which can be used to configure Cisco's firewalls.
92.860
However, we won’t cover GUIs in this course, and most network engineers prefer to use the
99.520
CLI over a GUI.
102.840
Now, how exactly do you connect to a Cisco device to configure it with the CLI?
108.770
There are a couple methods, but I’m going to talk about connecting via the console port.
114.869
Connecting to a device via the console port typically involves bringing your laptop to
118.680
the device and connecting to the console port of the device.
123.649
There are also methods to connect to a device remotely, but we’ll cover that later.
127.930
In any case, when you first configure a device, you have to connect to the console port.
135.150
This is an image of a Cisco catalyst switch, and notice the two console ports.
141.879
one of them is an RJ45 port, just like the switch’s network ports.
147.110
The other is a USB mini-b connector.
151.180
You can connect to either of these, but let’s say we’re going to connect to the RJ45 port.
156.190
You’re going to need the proper cable.
159.930
This is the kind of cable you will use.
162.650
Notice one end has an RJ45 connector, just like the Ethernet UTP cables we looked at.
169.090
The other end is a DB9 connector.
172.110
However, most laptops these days no longer have a serial port to plug the cable into,
177.879
so you’ll probably need an adapter, like this, to connect to a USB port on your laptop.
185.069
The actual name of the cable on the left is ‘rollover cable’.
189.459
The name is similar to a crossover cable, but it’s different than an Ethernet UTP crossover cable.
196.430
Like in an Ethernet UTP cable, there are 8 pins on each end that are used.
201.190
However, they connect like this: pin 1 to pin 8, pin 2 to pin 7, pin 3 to pin 6, pin 4 to
212.580
pin 5, pin 5 to pin 4, pin 6 to pin 3, pin 7 to pin 2, and pin 8 to pin 1.
223.780
So, once you’ve connected your computer to the device, how do you actually access the CLI?
230.299
Well, you need to use a terminal emulator, this one here, PuTTy, is a popular choice.
237.549
You can get it at putty.org. select serial, here, and then click open and you should be
244.489
connected to the CLI.
247.360
You should be able to connect with the default settings, but click serial down here, and
253.200
you can view and edit the default settings for the serial connection.
257.770
Note that these settings match the defaults on Cisco devices, so you’ll probably never
262.020
have to change them, but it’s good to be aware of them, and try to remember them for the test.
268.160
The speed, also known as baud rate, is 9,600 bits per second.
274.640
there are 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit.
279.890
Understanding data bits and stop bits is outside of the scope of the CCNA, but basically
284.800
it means that for each 8 bits of data one stop bit is sent, to mark the end of the 8 bits.
292.210
Parity is set to none.
294.230
Parity is used to detect errors.
296.680
And finally, flow control is set to none.
300.460
Flow control is exactly what it sounds like, controlling the flow of data from transmitter
304.390
to receiver, but again you don’t have to worry about the details for the exam.
309.430
Just remember Cisco’s defaults.
311.920
Speed of 9600 bits per second, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, and no flow control.
321.300
Once you connect to the device, you will be greeted with a screen like this.
327.630
Since this is the first time booting up the device, I am asked if I would like to enter
331.800
the initial configuration dialog, and I answer no.
336.570
Then I pressed the enter key to get started, and I’m now free to type commands into the CLI.
343.440
When you first enter the CLI, you will by default be in what’s called ‘user EXEC mode’.
350.250
User EXEC mode is indicated by the ‘greater than sign’ next to the host name of the device.
356.880
Note that the default host name for this device is ‘Router’.
361.310
The text displayed here always indicates the hostname of the device.
366.060
All devices have a hostname, and for a Cisco router the default name is Router.
372.870
User exec mode is very limited.
375.930
Users can look at some things, but can’t make any changes to the configuration.
381.590
Usually you don’t do anything in this mode.
384.520
You also might hear it called just ‘user mode’.
387.180
So, let’s move to a mode with a little more power to make changes to the device.
393.380
If you enter the ‘enable’ command in user EXEC mode, you will be placed in privileged exec mode.
400.280
In privileged exec mode, a pound sign, or hashtag, whatever you want to call it, is displayed.
407.370
Privileged EXEC mode provides complete access to view the device’s configuration, restart the device, etc.
415.020
This is not the mode in which you actually change the configuration, however you can
419.310
change the time on the device, and also save the current configuration file, among many other things.
426.880
This is a comparison of the commands available in user EXEC mode, on the left, and privileged
432.620
EXEC mode, on the right.
434.090
Also, I’m taking these screenshots from Cisco Packet Tracer software.
440.130
Packet tracer is a network simulator.
442.770
It is a fantastic resource for the CCNA, but it is limited beyond the CCNA.
448.560
There are many things which Packet Tracer doesn’t support, so if I were to show these
452.650
commands on a real device, you would probably see even more commands available here.
458.530
I want to repeat, however, that Packet tracer is an excellent resource for the CCNA and
463.400
you don’t really need to use anything else for your CCNA.
467.380
One more thing, notice the command I used to view the available commands.
472.580
You can use a question mark to view the commands that are available to you.
478.630
Now I want to show you a convenient feature of the CLI.
482.140
That is the tab key.
484.530
In the sample output here, notice the first line says en, the second says enable, and
491.470
then I entered privileged exec mode.
493.550
Well, if you press tab, the CLI will automatically complete the word for you, and display the
500.110
complete word on a new line.
502.390
However, another convenient thing is that you don’t even need to complete the command.
508.340
Here I just typed ‘en’, and hit enter, and I was brought to privileged EXEC mode.
514.820
This can really save you a lot of typing when you’re entering many commands.
519.660
There are limits to this, however.
521.940
Although ‘en’ was enough for the router to understand that I meant to use the command
526.000
‘enable’, that’s because it’s the only command that begins with EN that can
530.640
be entered in user EXEC mode.
533.580
If I type just ‘e’, however, we are told that it is an ambiguous command.
538.750
That’s because there’s more than one command that begins with e.
543.780
How can we view the commands that begin with e?
547.050
Well, remember the question mark from before?
549.280
If I type e, followed by a question mark, it displays the possible commands that begin with e.
556.050
There are two, enable and exit, so if I type just ‘e’ and hit enter, the router doesn’t
563.370
know which command I want to use.
565.470
So, the shortest form of the enable command is ‘en’.
569.230
And, the shortest form of the exit command is ‘ex’.
575.140
Now let’s actually make some changes to the router’s configuration.
579.270
To do so, we enter ‘global configuration mode’.
583.670
The command to enter configuration mode is configure terminal.
588.870
When in global configuration mode, config is inserted after the hostname.
594.840
Once again, you don’t have to type the whole word.
598.470
Notice I type con, followed by the question mark, and there are two options, configure and connect.
604.590
So, the shortest possible command for configure is conf, c-o-n-f.
610.120
However, terminal is the only option beginning with T, so all I need to type is CONF T to
618.060
enter global configuration mode.
621.090
From now on, in all of my lab demonstrations and such, I will probably be typing conf t
626.270
instead of configure terminal.
629.490
Try to remember that the full command is configure terminal, but also feel free to use the shortcuts.
635.570
Now, we don’t want just anyone to be able to make changes to the network configuration,
641.560
or even be able to just look at the configuration, because that could be a security risk.
647.180
We can protect privileged exec mode with a password, so that if a user enters the ‘enable’
652.170
command from user EXEC mode, they are asked for the password.
657.160
That is done with the command ‘enable password’ in global configuration mode.
662.170
First, I want to clarify the use of the question mark.
667.070
Notice that I used the question mark with no space after password.
671.070
here is the output.
673.040
If you use the question mark with no space, it shows you all possible completions of that word.
679.050
I already typed the full word password, so it just displays the word again, and there
684.240
are no other words that begin with p-a-s-s-w-o-r-d.
690.700
Next I used the question mark again, this time with a space after password.
695.940
Notice the difference in the output.
698.630
This time it shows all possible options we could enter next in the command.
703.590
In this case, I used the middle one.
706.790
Notice that LINE is in all capital letters.
710.570
That means that you don’t actually type LINE, you type a line which will become the password.
717.740
I typed CCNA in all capitals as the password.
722.700
Note that Password ARE case-sensitive, so CCNA in capital letters and ccna in lower-case
730.120
letters are different passwords.
733.650
Once again I typed the question mark to check if there are any further options.
737.330
This cr means that there are no further options, the only option is to press enter to enter the command.
744.460
I pressed enter, and now the password is set. Let’s test it.
748.860
So, let’s test out our password.
752.620
I type exit to return to privileged EXEC mode. from privileged exec mode, if I type exit
759.110
again I am logged out of the device and see the starting screen again.
764.060
If I press enter here
765.130
I am brought back to user exec mode.
770.050
If I enter the enable command, I am asked for a password.
774.690
No password displays here, but I am brought to privileged exec mode.
778.630
That’s because the password does not display as you type it, for security purposes.
784.250
Also, note that if you enter the wrong password 3 times , you will be denied access for having ‘bad secrets’.
792.110
I think everyone has bad secrets of some kind, but in this case it means an incorrect password.
797.930
Let’s review what we’ve done so far.
802.800
In my experience it was difficult to get used to operating in the CLI when I first started
807.190
learning, so we’ll take it slow and review along the way.
811.370
Also, make sure to check out the next video after you finish this, which will have you doing these same tasks in packet tracer.
819.050
Hands-on practice is absolutely essential to get comfortable with the CLI.
823.150
So, I use the enable command to enter privileged exec mode.
828.740
From privileged exec mode, I use configure terminal to enter global configuration mode.
835.020
In global configuration mode, I use the command enable password CCNA to protect privileged
841.560
exec mode with a password.
843.410
Remember, this password is case-sensitive.
848.230
Then I type exit to return to privileged exec mode.
852.190
And exit again to return to user exec mode.
855.779
I type enable again.
858.060
then I enter the password, which isn’t displayed as I type it, and I am brought back into privileged EXEC mode.
866.460
We confirmed the function of the password, but let’s take a look at the configuration
870.310
file itself to check it.
873.529
First I want to explain the two configuration files kept on the device.
878.220
As I said, there are two separate configuration files kept on the device at once.
883.500
One is the running-config.
886.130
This is the current, active configuration file on the device.
890.590
As you enter commands in the CLI, you edit the active configuration.
896.210
The startup-config is the configuration file that will be loaded upon restart of the device.
902.640
If you reload the device, or shut it down and then turn it on later, the startup-config will be loaded.
910.320
So let’s take a look at the configuration files.
914.300
Use the ‘show running-config’ command in global configuration mode to view the running configuration file.
921.779
There is lots of data in the file by default, so I only included the output up to the command we entered.
927.260
Here’s the command, enable password CCNA, in the running-config.
933.880
How about the startup-config?
936.339
You can view it with the show startup-config command, however as you can see, at this point
942.180
it just displays the message ‘startup-config is not present’.
946.820
This is because we haven’t saved the running configuration yet, so every time we restart
951.680
the router it will load a default configuration, not the startup-configuration.
955.880
Let’s save the configuration file.
960.990
There are actually three ways you can save the running-configuration, to make it the startup-configuration.
967.339
All three of these commands are executed from privileged exec mode.
971.830
The first is ‘write’.
973.920
It says building configuration, and then an OK message to indicate that the configuration was saved.
980.820
The second method is write memory, it performs the same function.
985.990
The third command is copy running-config startup-config.
990.790
This tells the router to copy the running-config file to the startup-config file, again performing
996.620
the same function as the previous two commands.
1000.310
Now if I use the show startup-config command again, it displays the same configuration
1005.180
as the show running-config command.
1008.870
Once again, however, this is only the beginning of the output, there is more below.
1013.660
We’ll check it out in the packet tracer lab video coming up next.
1018.529
Now, you can see the enable password right here, in plain text.
1023.850
This is a security risk, because anyone who simply takes a glance at this password knows
1029.350
how to get into privileged exec mode, and then global configuration mode to make changes to the device.
1034.990
Let’s level up the security a bit.
1038.929
You can do so with the ‘service password-encryption’ command in global configuration mode.
1046.150
Notice I used the short version of configure terminal, conf t, to enter global configuration mode.
1053.179
Remember that all of these commands have shortcuts.
1055.860
I’ll usually use the full command for these instructional videos, but in the labs
1061.360
when I enter the commands live you’ll see me using the shortcuts a lot.
1065.680
Anyway, the service password-encryption command will encrypt all passwords in a jumble of
1071.270
numbers and letters, so that they cannot be easily read.
1075.850
If I enter the show running-config command again, notice that the password ‘CCNA’ has become 08026F6028.
1086.620
The password itself hasn’t changed, it is still CCNA, only the way it is displayed in
1092.059
the configuration has changed.
1094.590
Also, you may notice that a 7 has appeared before the password.
1099.730
This number ‘7’ indicates the type of encryption used to encrypt the password.
1105.060
The number 7 means it is using Cisco’s proprietary encryption algorithm, from the service password-encryption
1110.910
command. Later in this video you will see another number in that place.
1116.970
While using the ‘service password-encryption’ command is more secure than not using it,
1122.470
it’s still not very secure.
1125.500
In this screenshot I simply searched for a cisco type 7 password cracker on google, found
1131.520
this website, and was able to crack the password in a few seconds.
1137.240
The good news, though, is that there is a more secure enable password that can be used
1141.170
on Cisco devices, with a tougher type of encryption.
1145.880
The more secure method is to use the enable secret command, instead of the enable password command.
1153.250
This time I used a password of Cisco, with an upper-case C. Once again, this is case-sensitive.
1161.000
Then I view the running configuration once more.
1164.270
However, since I was still in global configuration mode, I typed ‘do’ in front of the command.
1171.540
This is a convenient trick that allows you to execute privileged exec mode commands like
1175.760
show running-config or show startup-config, in other configuration levels.
1182.370
Also notice I used shortcuts, sh instead of show, and run instead of running-config.
1191.030
Now you can see the enable secret in the running-configuration.
1195.120
Notice the number 5 before the encrypted password.
1199.010
Number 5 indicates MD5 type encryption, which is much more secure than what we got with
1204.170
the service password-encryption command.
1207.480
It can still be cracked, no password is invincible, but its much better.
1213.210
Also notice that the enable password command remains, it isn’t replaced.
1218.370
However, if both the enable secret and enable password commands are configured, the enable
1224.100
password will be ignored, only the enable secret will be valid.
1229.520
One final note, the ‘service password-encryption’ command has NO effect on the enable secret command.
1236.770
The enable secret is always encrypted, whether or not you entered the service password-encryption command.
1242.620
So, really you should always use the enable secret, instead of the enable password, as
1247.771
it is more secure.
1251.280
Now I want to show you one more thing in the CLI before we move on to the quiz for today’s video.
1257.290
That is, how you cancel, or delete, a command that you entered.
1262.320
That is done by typing ‘no’ in front of the command.
1266.710
For example, if I type ‘no’ in front of the service password encryption command, future
1272.390
passwords will no longer be encrypted.
1274.980
However, as you can see here, passwords which are already encrypted will NOT be decrypted
1281.640
by disabling service password-encryption.
1285.049
If I enter a new password, however, it will be in clear text, NOT encrypted.
1290.549
So, let me summarize the service-password encryption command.
1296.240
If you enable service password-encryption.. current passowords will be encrypted.
1303.480
future passwords will also be encrypted.
1307.000
Once again, however, the enable secret will not be affected, it is always encrypted.
1312.740
If you disable service password-encryption... current passwords will not be decrypted, they will remain encrypted.
1321.960
Future passwords will not be encrypted, they will remain in clear-text.
1326.830
The enable secret will not be effected, once again it is always encrypted.
1331.840
Let’s review all of the commands and such we learned in this lesson.
1336.150
First, the different modes of the Cisco CLI we looked at today.
1341.390
First is user EXEC mode, indicated by the greater than sign.
1347.049
Next is privileged exec mode, indicated by a pound, or hashtag.
1352.850
Finally is global configuration mode, indicated by config in brackets, plus the hashtag.
1360.500
Now let’s review some commands.
1362.720
The first is enable, which is used to enter privileged exec mode.
1367.560
Next is configure terminal, which is used to enter global configuration mode.
1373.510
Next is enable password, which configures a password to protect privileged exec mode.
1380.900
The next command is service password-encryption, which encrypts the enable password, as well
1386.740
as other passwords which we can configure on the device.
1389.980
enable secret, which configures a more secure enable password, which is always encrypted.
1398.020
Next is run (ERRATA: should be 'do'), which is used in front of a privileged exec-level command to let you run it in global configuration mode.
1407.970
The next command is no, which is used to remove a command which you previously configured.
1414.500
Next is show running-config, which displays the current, active configuration file on the device.
1422.510
Show startup-config displays the saved configuration file which will be loaded if the device is restarted.
1429.470
Okay, last three, and these are all used to save the current running configuration and
1435.390
make it the startup configuration.
1438.040
They are… write, write memory, and copy running-config startup-config.
1445.880
Okay, let’s move on to this video’s quiz, first up, question 1.
1453.470
What kind of cable is used to connect to a Cisco device via the RJ45 console port? A, rollover cable. B, crossover cable.
1465.610
Or C, USB cable.
1468.919
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1475.570
The answer is A , rollover cable.
1478.010
Let’s check the answers.
1481.330
A crossover cable is used to connect two devices, for example switch and switch, or router and router, or router and PC, etc.) via Ethernet.
1492.650
It is not used to connect to a Cisco device via the RJ45 console port.
1497.790
So b, crossover cable, is incorrect.
1502.070
This picture shows the wiring on an Ethernet crossover cable…
1508.410
Although USB cables can be used to connect to the console of a Cisco device, the USB
1513.500
console port is separate from the RJ45 console port.
1517.990
So c, USB cable, is incorrect.
1522.030
This photo shows the usb and RJ45 console ports on a Cisco switch….

A rollover cable is used to connect to the RJ45 console port on a Cisco device.
1535.360
So A, rollover cable, is the correct answer.
1539.710
This image shows the wiring in a rollover cable, connecting pin 1 on one side to pin
1544.710
8 on the other, pin 2 to pin 7, pin 3 to pin 6, etc.

Let’s go to Question 2.
1554.510
You type enable to enter privileged exec mode on your Cisco router, however the password
1559.870
you enter is not accepted.
1562.299
What could be the problem?
1564.210
A, service password-encryption is enabled.
1568.440
B, service password-encryption is disabled.
1572.950
Or C, Caps Lock is on.
1576.400
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1583.460
the answer is C, caps lock is on. Let’s check.
1589.260
service password-encryption is irrelevant.
1591.850
It doesn’t change the password itself, only how it is displayed in the configuration.
1597.240
So A, service password-encryption is enabled, and B, service password-encryption is disabled, are incorrect.
1606.910
Passwords are case-sensitive, so if caps lock is on it could cause you to enter an incorrect
1611.840
password even if you think you’re entering it correctly.
1615.950
So C, caps lock is on, is the correct answer.
1618.940
Let’s go to question 3.
1623.750
What is the most secure method to protect access to privileged EXEC mode?
1628.340
A, the enable secret command.
1631.590
B, the enable password command.
1635.530
Or C, the enable password command, with service password-encryption.
1640.900
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1646.740
The answer is A, the enable secret command. Let’s check.
1651.809
The enable password command configures a plain-text password, which is not secure as it can be easily read.
1659.130
So B, the enable password, is incorrect.
1665.030
Using service password-encryption encrypts the enable password to make it more secure,
1669.690
but it is a weak form of encryption.
1672.260
So c, enable password with service password-encryption, is incorrect.
1679.560
The enable secret command configures a password that is automatically encrypted.
1684.110
It uses MD5, a more secure form of encryption than the service password-encryption command.
1690.810
So A, the enable secret command, is the correct answer.
1694.430
Let’s go to question 4.
1698.110
If both the enable password and the enable secret command are configured, what will happen
1703.059
when you use enable to enter privileged EXEC mode?
1707.200
A, you must enter the enable password, followed by the enable secret.
1712.890
B, you must enter the enable password only.
1717.420
Or C, you must enter the enable secret only.
1721.340
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1727.460
The answer is C, you must enter the enable secret only.
1731.260
There’s not much else to explain here, the enable secret always takes precedence over
1736.320
the enable password, and you’ll never be asked to enter both.
1740.390
So C, you must enter the enable secret only, is the correct answer.
1745.220
let’s go to the final question.
1749.730
You enter the conf t command to enter global configuration mode.
1754.700
What is the full-length version of the command? A, configuration time. B, configure terminal.
1764.100
Or C, configuration terminal.
1767.690
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1773.660
The answer is B, configure terminal.
1776.500
Again, no special explanation is necessary here.
1780.809
Even though the shortcuts are great to use to reduce the amount of typing you have to
1784.110
do to enter commands, make sure you still know the full-length versions of the commands!
1791.679
In addition to the quiz we just did, there are a couple other supplementary materials
1796.400
to help you remember what you learned.
1799.250
The first is review flash cards, check the link in the description.
1804.150
These flash cards will be extremely helpful when memorizing all of these commands and how they work.
1809.830
In addition, there will also be a packet tracer practice lab, to give you hands-on practice
1815.570
configuring Cisco devices in the CLI.
1818.480
Especially for this video I highly recommend you do the practice lab.
1824.420
It will really help you get used to the CLI.
1827.950
That lab will be in the next video.
1829.809
Thank you for watching.
