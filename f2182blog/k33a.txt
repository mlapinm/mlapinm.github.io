cryptocurrency options in the
description 14.926853 in this lab we will once
again configure NTP Network Time
Protocol 21.221978 unlike last lab however we will
also configure authentication to ensure
that our routers r2 and r3 only sing to
a trusted time source r1
32.913395 first we will once again configure the
time zone and time on r1 38.404103 unable I'll set
the time to 9:00 p.m. jst again like the
previous lab 45.170999 remember the clock set
command we are going to use sets the
timing UTC 51.153332 my time zone is nine hours
ahead of UTC so I have to set the time
to nine hours behind what I actually
want the time to be 58.944915 clock set 12 o'clock
August 22nd 2019 69.048831 now let's set the time
zone
71.486269 conf t clock time zone is jst9 77.235914 now let's
configure NTP 80.224393 first I'll configure it as
an NTP server with a default stratum
level which is 8 86.092747 NTP master now let's
set up NTP authentication 92.528351 the first
command is NTP authenticate 97.253622 now we have
to set up two keys 99.739976 one for r2 and one
for r3 102.546142 we could actually use a single
key for both routers but the
instructions say to use two 108.562288 to make a
key we use this command NTP
authentication key followed by the key
number one md5 then the key string Cisco
1 123.456183 now let's create key number two as
well 126.493558 NTP authentication key to md5
cisco2 133.443745 we're not done yet however let's
configure these as trusted keys 138.160432 ntp
trusted key 1 ntp trusted key 2 144.831682 ok we
have completed the configuration on r1
149.298369 now let's set up r2 153.182660 enable conf t
clock time zones JST 9 161.924929 remember ntp
doesn't sync the time zone 165.688783 so we still
have to configure which time zone we
want to display the time in 169.529137 now let's
setup NTP authentication and then set r1
as the server 175.234220 NTP authenticate NTP
authentication key 1 md5 Cisco 1 186.138740 NTP
trusted key 1 190.094720 now to set R 1 as the
server we have to add something to the
command we used in the previous lab 196.739970 NTP
server 192.168.12.1 key 1 204.303282 we add key
followed by the key number to the end of
the command 209.435657 as I mentioned in the
previous lab NTP can take some time to
synchronize 215.878261 I'm going to configure r3
first before we check on r2
220.334448 then I'll cut the video and wait for
everything to synchronize 224.049302 enable conf t
clock time zone jst 9 NTP authenticate
NTP authentication to md5 Cisco 2 NTP
trusted key 2 245.827135 NTP server 192.168.13.1 key
2 252.737196 now that the configuration is
complete I'll cut the video and wait for
the time to synchronize
259.514946 okay we're back 264.897862 let's check if
everything is good on r2 266.933966 show clock
detail 270.039153 time sources NTP looks good 272.401132 show
NTP associations 277.031507 we are synched to r
one 192.168.12.1 281.702777 its reference clock is a
loopback address on r one 127.127.1.1 and it's stratum level is eight
289.364172 note the asterisk and the tilled on the
Left 293.952817 the tilde indicates that this
association has been configured 297.914129 and the
asterisk essentially means that we're
synced to the pier 301.819921 now let's check on
r3 show clock detail 307.202733 again time
sources NTP show NTP associations 314.631587 our
server is r1 at 192.168.13.1 319.824628 and again
notice the asterisk and tilled on the
Left 323.745420 we have successfully synchronized
the time with NTP 327.180253 that's all for this
