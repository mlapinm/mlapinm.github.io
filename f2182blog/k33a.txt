welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab you can download the lab

file from the link in the description if

you like these labs please consider

supporting me via my patreon or the

cryptocurrency options in the

description in this lab we will once

again configure NTP Network Time

Protocol unlike last lab however we will

also configure authentication to ensure

that our routers r2 and r3 only sing to

a trusted time source r1

first we will once again configure the

time zone and time on r1 unable I'll set

the time to 9:00 p.m. jst again like the

previous lab remember the clock set

command we are going to use sets the

timing UTC my time zone is nine hours

ahead of UTC so I have to set the time

to nine hours behind what I actually

want the time to be clock set 12 o'clock

August 22nd 2019 now let's set the time

zone

comte clock time zone is t9 now let's

configure NTP first I'll configure it as

an NTP server with a default stratum

level which is 8 NTP master now let's

set up NTP authentication the first

command is NTP authenticate now we have

to set up two keys one for r2 and one

for r3 we could actually use a single

key for both routers but the

instructions say to use two to make a

key we use this command NTP

authentication key followed by the key

number one md5 then the key string Cisco

1 now let's create key number two as

well NTP authentication key to md5

go to we're not done yet however let's

configure these as trusted keys ntp

trusted key 1 ntp trusted key - ok we

have completed the configuration on r1

now let's set up our to enable compte

clock time zones AST 9 remember ntp

doesn't sync the time zone so we still

have to configure which time zone we

want to display the time in now let's

setup NTP authentication and then set r1

as the server NTP authenticate NTP

authentication key 1 md5 Cisco 1 NTP

trusted key 1 now to set R 1 as the

server we have to add something to the

command we used in the previous lab NTP

server 192.168 12.1 key 1 we add key

followed by the key number to the end of

the command as I mentioned in the

previous lab NTP can take some time to

synchronize I'm going to configure r3

first before we check on r2

then I'll cut the video and wait for

everything to synchronize enable compte

clock time zone jst 9 NTP authenticate

NTP authentication to md5 Cisco to NTP

trusted key to NTP server 192.168.1 key

to now that the configuration is

complete I'll cut the video and wait for

the time to synchronize

okay we're back let's check if

everything is good on our to show clock

detail time sources NTP looks good show

NTP associations we are synched to our

one 192.168.1.1 its reference clock is a

loopback address on our one one two 7.1

- 7.1.1 and it's stratum level is eight

note the asterisk and the tilled on the

Left the tilde indicates that this

association has been configured and the

asterisk essentially means that we're

synced to the pier now let's check on

our three show clock detail again time

sources NTP show NTP associations our

server is r1 at 192.168.1 and again

notice the asterisk and tilled on the

Left we have successfully synchronized

the time with NTP that's all for this
