Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,770
In this video we’ll look at LAN architectures.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:27,960
By architectures, I mean how devices like
routers, switches, PCs, servers, etc are connected

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,490
together to make networks.

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:38,160
These LAN architectures are exam topics 1.2.a,
b, c, and e. 2 tier, 3 tier, spine-leaf, and

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,480
small office/home office.

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,760
The other topics in 1.2, 1.2.d which is WAN
and 1.2.f which is on-premises and cloud,

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,140
will be covered in separate videos.

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,710
Here’s what we’ll cover in this video.

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,960
Actually, it’s exactly the exam topics I
just pointed out.

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,500
First we’ll cover 2-tier and 3-tier LAN
architectures.

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,670
These are common traditional LAN designs used
in enterprise networks.

18
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,619
Then we’ll cover spine-leaf architecture,
which is a design common in data center environments.

19
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:16,650
Finally I’ll briefly cover SOHO, Small Office/Home
Office networks.

20
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,760
Small networks like this are different than
the others in that they typically have a single

21
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,990
network device acting as router, switch, firewall,
and wireless access point.

22
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,380
Watch until the end of the video for a bonus
practice question from Boson Software’s

23
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,900
ExSim for CCNA, my recommended practice exams
for the CCNA.

24
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,020
Before actually getting into the topics for
this video, let me introduce why this section

25
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,490
of the course is important.

26
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,939
You have studied various network technologies
up to this point in the course, such as routing

27
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:56,110
and switching, STP, EtherChannel, OSPF, FHRPs,
switch security features, etc.

28
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:01,969
So, now let’s look at some basic concepts
of network design and architecture.

29
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:06,390
Network design is a very deep topic and to
be a good network designer, a good network

30
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,150
architect, requires a deep understanding of
general principals as well as the needs of

31
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,520
the specific customer.

32
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,400
Although there are standard best practices
for network design, there are very few universal

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,569
correct answers.

34
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:24,900
The answer to most general questions about
network design is ‘it depends’, because

35
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,879
the requirements of each network are different.

36
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:33,129
Now, in the early stages of your networking
career you probably won’t be asked to design

37
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:34,260
networks yourself.

38
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,440
That’s usually left for the more experienced
engineers.

39
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,290
However, to understand the networks you will
be configuring and troubleshooting it’s

40
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,080
important to know some basics of network design
and architecture.

41
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,090
So, in this video and the next few we’ll
cover some basic concepts.

42
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,260
And now, before introducing the two-tier and
three-tier LAN designs which are the main

43
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,629
topics of this video, I want to briefly introduce
a few common terminologies you might hear

44
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:05,120
and which I might use throughout this video.

45
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,790
These are general terms, not only for LAN
design but for connections between devices

46
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,480
in general.

47
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,900
The first one is called a ‘star’ topology.

48
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,750
When several devices all connect to one central
device we can draw them in a star shape like

49
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,230
below, so this is often called a star topology.

50
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:29,440
In the diagram below, all PCs connect to one
central switch, and I have placed them in

51
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,569
a star shape around the switch.

52
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:36,840
Note that in network diagrams the devices
might not be drawn like this, in the shape

53
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,409
of a star.

54
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:43,430
But if many devices are all connected to one
central device, we can call it a star topology

55
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,909
regardless of how the diagram is drawn.

56
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:51,930
The next term is full mesh, which is when
each device is connected to each other device,

57
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,030
forming a mesh.

58
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,670
Here’s an example.

59
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,360
6 routers, and each router is connected to
each other router.

60
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,090
This is called a full mesh topology.

61
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,519
The last one I want to introduce is partial
mesh, which is when some devices are connected

62
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,519
to each other, but not all.

63
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,940
Here’s an example with four switches.

64
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,519
Notice that the top two switches are both
connected to each other switch, but the bottom

65
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,340
two switches are not directly connected.

66
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,710
This is a partial mesh topology.

67
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,610
Okay, those are the three general terms I
wanted to introduce.

68
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,080
You’ll see examples of them throughout this
video and the next video, so make sure to

69
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,560
remember them.

70
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,090
Now let’s get into the basics of campus
LAN design.

71
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:42,380
By campus LAN, I mean a LAN of devices in
a building, or perhaps multiple buildings,

72
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,960
that are close to each other.

73
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,540
Remember, LAN stands for Local Area Network.

74
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,900
First we’ll look at the two-tier LAN design,
which consists of two hierarchical layers:

75
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,710
the access layer and the distribution layer.

76
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:02,550
The two tier design is also called a ‘collapsed
core’ design because it omits a layer that

77
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,150
is found in the three tier design, the core
layer.

78
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,090
Or more accurately, it combines the two together
into one layer.

79
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,710
So, in the next slide I’ll show you an example
of a two-tier design but first let me summarize

80
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,830
each layer.

81
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,370
First, the access layer.

82
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:25,720
This is the layer that end hosts connect to,
for example PCs, printers, security cameras,

83
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
etc.

84
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,520
They will usually connect to an access layer
switch.

85
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,480
So, typically access layer switches have lots
of ports for end hosts to connect to.

86
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,660
QoS marking is typically done here.

87
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,210
This is the layer that end hosts connect to,
so we usually mark traffic here because it’s

88
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,310
a good practice to mark traffic as early as
possible in the network.

89
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:54,449
Security services like port security, DAI,
etc are typically performed here, too.

90
00:05:54,449 --> 00:06:00,539
Also, switchports might be PoE, Power over
Ethernet-enabled if there are wireless access

91
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,610
points or IP phones in the LAN.

92
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,330
So that’s the access layer, the switches
that end hosts connect to.

93
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,389
Then there is the distribution layer.

94
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:14,710
These switches aggregate connections from
the access layer switches.

95
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:20,130
So, depending on how many end hosts there
are your network might have many access layer

96
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,710
switches.

97
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,490
Those connections are then usually aggregated
to a redundant pair of two distribution layer

98
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,470
switches, as you’ll see in the next slide.

99
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:34,669
Typically, this is the border between Layer
2 and Layer 3 in the network.

100
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:41,050
So, the distribution layer switches run both
Layer 3 protocols such as OSPF and Layer 2

101
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,540
protocols such as spanning tree.

102
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,940
This is not always the case, but usually the
connections from the access layer switches

103
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,860
to the distribution layer switches are Layer
2 connections, and then end hosts use the

104
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,750
SVIs on the distribution layer switches as
their default gateways.

105
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,599
The distribution layer is used to connect
to services such as Internet, WAN, etc.

106
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:05,740
Okay, let’s look at an example.

107
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,199
Here’s a simple two-tier campus LAN network.

108
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:16,009
The two access-layer switches, A1 and A2,
each have some different end hosts connected,

109
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:19,310
and each also has a wireless access point
connected too.

110
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:26,419
D1 and D2 are the distribution layer switches,
and each is connected to both A1 and A2.

111
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:31,020
This provides redundancy, by having extra
connections in case one fails.

112
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:36,400
However, the connections between the access
layer and distribution layer are Layer 2,

113
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,080
and that means loops can occur.

114
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,540
So, spanning-tree protocol disables a few
links to prevent loops.

115
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:50,240
Now, D1 and D2 are multilayer switches, and
the end hosts use the SVIs on D1 and D2 as

116
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,870
their default gateways.

117
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:59,110
So, they will probably be using a first hop
redundancy protocol such as HSRP or VRRP to

118
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:04,379
provide a redundant virtual IP address for
hosts to use as their default gateway.

119
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:09,050
As I said before, the distribution layer is
used to connect to services such as the Internet

120
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,970
or the WAN, as well as other parts of the
LAN.

121
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:17,080
So, here’s the connection to the Internet,
two redundant connections to two different

122
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,510
Internet Service Providers.

123
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,780
And perhaps there’s another set of distribution
and access switches over here, with lots of

124
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,400
servers connected to the access layer switches.

125
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,940
Notice that each distribution layer switch
is connected to each other distribution layer

126
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,570
switch.

127
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:38,649
By the way, in a collapsed core two-tier design
like this, the distribution layer is sometimes

128
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:43,800
called the core-distribution layer, because
it has to fulfill the purpose of both layers.

129
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,890
We’ll see the core layer later.

130
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:52,680
These connections between distribution switches
are Layer 3, no spanning-tree running here.

131
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,960
Routing information can be shared via OSPF,
for example.

132
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,530
So, this is an example of a two-tier network
architecture.

133
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:05,891
The end hosts connect to the access layer
which performs things like QoS marking, security

134
00:09:05,891 --> 00:09:09,140
features like DAI, etc.

135
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,290
The distribution layer switches aggregate
those connections and then connect further

136
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:18,370
to services like the Internet and to other
parts of the LAN.

137
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:23,050
Now let me relate this back to those common
terminologies I mentioned at the beginning.

138
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,830
Although I haven’t drawn the diagram like
a star, at the access layer we have many devices

139
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,649
all connecting to one central device, each
access switch.

140
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:35,560
So, these are four small star topologies.

141
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,720
If I put more end hosts on the diagram and
arranged them around each access switch, it

142
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,640
would look more like a star, but I think you
get the point.

143
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,680
And here we have a couple partial mesh topologies
between the access layers and the distribution

144
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,339
layers.

145
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:55,490
Notice that the distribution switches are
connected to each other and to each access

146
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,880
switch, but the access switches aren’t directly
connected.

147
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,260
So, these are two partial meshes.

148
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,920
And finally, between the four distribution
layer switches we have a full mesh.

149
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,340
Each distribution switch is connected to each
other distribution switch, forming a full

150
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,340
mesh.

151
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:18,279
You’ll see elements of full-mesh, partial-mesh,
and star topologies in all kinds of network

152
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:23,870
designs, and often combinations of them sometimes
called a hybrid topology, so once again make

153
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,280
sure you remember these terms.

154
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,660
Now, if the network gets larger we might have
many distribution layers connecting to different

155
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,310
parts of the LAN.

156
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,680
Do you see anything wrong with this?

157
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,560
In large LAN networks with many distribution
layer switches, for example in separate buildings

158
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,480
across a campus, the number of connections
required between distribution layer switches

159
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,390
grows rapidly.

160
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:52,040
This makes it much more difficult and complicated
to scale the network, to make it bigger.

161
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,430
So, to help scale large LAN networks you can
add a Core Layer.

162
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,640
By the way, Cisco recommends adding a Core
Layer if there are more than three distribution

163
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,870
layers in a single location.

164
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,660
In this case there are 6, so we should add
a core layer.

165
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,380
Here’s how it looks with a core layer added.

166
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:16,380
Each distribution layer connects to the core
layer, no need for a full mesh of direct connections

167
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,399
between the distribution layer switches.

168
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:23,870
These core layer switches are a pair of very
powerful and fast switches.

169
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,720
So let’s take a look at how the core layer
works now.

170
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,529
When we add a Core Layer we now have a three-tier
LAN design, access, distribution, and core.

171
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:36,620
Let’s talk about that core layer.

172
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,930
It connections separate distribution layers
together in large LAN networks.

173
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:45,540
The focus of this layer is speed, you might
hear the term ‘fast transport’ as being

174
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,880
a goal of the core layer.

175
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,540
CPU-intensive operations such as security
features, QoS marking and classification,

176
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,730
etc should be avoided at this Layer.

177
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,930
We just want fast forwarding of packets, nothing
extra.

178
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,370
And the connections are all Layer 3.

179
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,579
We definitely don’t want spanning tree at
the Core Layer.

180
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:11,890
The core layer should maintain connectivity
throughout the LAN even if devices fail.

181
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:17,079
Because it’s the backbone of the LAN, redundancy
of devices and connections is very important.

182
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:21,700
Let’s take a look at the previous topology
with an added core layer.

183
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,740
Here’s how the network might look with the
addition of a core layer.

184
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,600
This time, the core switches connect to the
Internet routers.

185
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,480
And if we have additional distribution and
access layers, where will they connect?

186
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,490
As you know, they will also connect to the
core switches.

187
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,110
So, this is an example of a three-tier campus
LAN.

188
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:48,310
For smaller LANs two tiers is sufficient,
but larger LANs will likely have three tiers

189
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,310
like this.

190
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:54,410
Okay, let’s review those tiers once more
and then move on.

191
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,600
Here are those attributes of each Layer again.

192
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,980
For the access layer, remember that it is
the layer that end hosts connect to and it

193
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:09,829
often performs services like QoS marking,
port security, DAI, DHCP snooping, etc.

194
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:14,070
For the distribution layer, remember that
it is all about aggregating connections from

195
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,889
the access layer and serves as the border
between the Layer 2 network and the Layer

196
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:20,430
3 network.

197
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:25,260
In a two-tier design it connects to services
such as the Internet and WAN, although in

198
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,710
a three-tier network usually those connections
will be to the core layer instead.

199
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:35,880
Notice I added an extra note saying that it
is sometimes called the aggregation layer.

200
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,790
Remember that, as aggregation of connections
is an essential function of this layer.

201
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:46,670
Finally, the core layer is used in large LANs
to connect distribution layers together, and

202
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:53,790
the focus is on speed, so we avoid operations
like security and QoS marking and classification.

203
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,790
All connections here are Layer 3.

204
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:00,010
Okay, that’s all for the two- and three-tier
campus LAN designs.

205
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:05,500
Keep in mind what I said earlier, there are
very few universal correct answers in network

206
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,910
design.

207
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:12,000
Although these two- and three-tier LAN designs
are common practice and recommended by Cisco,

208
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,699
in the real world there are countless variations
depending on the needs of the enterprise.

209
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:22,160
Let’s move on to the topic of Spine-Leaf
architecture.

210
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,410
This photo I’m showing you was taken in
a data center, and the reason why I’m showing

211
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:31,019
you it is because spine-leaf architecture
was designed for data centers.

212
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:36,670
Currently I work for a large data center provider,
so I spend a lot of time in environments like

213
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,670
this.

214
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:41,480
So, what exactly is a data center?

215
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,810
Data centers are dedicated spaces or buildings
used to store computer systems such as servers

216
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,070
and network devices.

217
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:54,019
They typically contain halls of racks, like
the previous photo, and the servers and network

218
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:57,510
devices are mounted onto the racks.

219
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:02,860
Traditional data center designs used a three-tier
architecture, access, distribution, and core,

220
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,830
like we just covered.

221
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:10,019
This traditional design worked well when most
of the traffic in the data center was north-south.

222
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:11,139
What does that mean?

223
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:17,010
Well, if we look at this diagram, north-south
refers to traffic from access layer up to

224
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:21,980
distribution, core, and then perhaps out to
the Internet or back down south to the other

225
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,110
distribution and access layers.

226
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:29,190
These other sections of the LAN are drawn
off to the side so the traffic doesn’t look

227
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:34,149
north-south when drawing the arrows in this
diagram, but this is north-south traffic too,

228
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:35,790
of course.

229
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:40,360
This is in contrast to east-west traffic,
which is for example traffic between these

230
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,940
servers in the same part of the network like
this, the traffic doesn’t go out to other

231
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,019
parts of the LAN or out to the Internet.

232
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:53,130
With the precedence of virtual servers, which
is a topic I’ll cover soon in the course

233
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:59,329
by the way, applications are often deployed
in a distributed manner, across multiple physical

234
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:04,320
servers, which increases the amount of East-West
traffic in the data center.

235
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,250
If you’re not sure what a virtual server
is or you don’t know what virtualization

236
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,870
is, like I said I’ll cover it soon in another
video.

237
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:17,769
Anyway, the point is that with this increase
in east-west traffic, the traditional three-tier

238
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:23,320
architecture led to bottlenecks in bandwidth
as well as variability in the server-to-server

239
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,279
latency depending on the path the traffic
takes.

240
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,529
To solve this, spine-leaf architecture, also
called Clos architecture after the name of

241
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:36,240
one of the designers, has become prominent
in data centers.

242
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,840
Let’s check it out.

243
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,800
Here’s what spine-leaf architecture looks
like.

244
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,339
It’s two-tier, but different than the traditional
two-tier design we looked at before.

245
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:52,750
There are spine switches and leaf switches,
and here are the basic rules about spine-leaf

246
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,980
architecture.

247
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,709
Every leaf switch is connected to every spine
switch.

248
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:04,000
If you look at the diagram below, there are
three spine switches, and each leaf switch

249
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,470
has three uplinks, one to each spine switch.

250
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:12,020
Therefore, every spine switch is connected
to every leaf switch too.

251
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:18,060
However, leaf switches do not connect to other
leaf switches, and spine switches do not connect

252
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,230
to other spine switches.

253
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:25,280
Finally, end hosts, for example servers, only
connect to leaf switches.

254
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,120
They are like the ‘access layer’ of the
spine-leaf architecture.

255
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,010
Okay, those are the main rules of spine-leaf
architecture.

256
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:38,990
The path taken by traffic is randomly chosen
to balance the traffic load among the spine

257
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,170
switches.

258
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:45,169
And each server is separated by the same number
of ‘hops’, except those connected to the

259
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:50,380
same leaf switch which have fewer hops of
course, and this provides consistent latency

260
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,860
for east-west traffic, traffic between the
servers.

261
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:00,169
For example, for this server on the left to
reach this other server the traffic passes

262
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:02,860
through three switches.

263
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,490
And then to reach this other server it once
again has to pass through three switches.

264
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,970
So, that’s spine-leaf architecture.

265
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:15,240
It’s also very simple to scale, because
if you need to add more servers you can just

266
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,240
add another leaf switch and connect it to
the existing spine switches.

267
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,169
As with all topics in the CCNA, there is a
lot more depth to spine-leaf architecture

268
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:29,950
than what I just mentioned, but make sure
you know these basic characteristics of Spine-Leaf

269
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,580
for the CCNA exam, and you should be set.

270
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,230
Now let’s move on to the final topic.

271
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,530
That final topic is SOHO networks.

272
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:46,090
Small Office/Home Office, also called SOHO
refers to the office of a small company, or

273
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,789
a small home office with few devices.

274
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:52,470
Now, it doesn’t actually have to be used
as an office.

275
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,870
If your home has a network connected to the
Internet it is considered a SOHO network.

276
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,260
SOHO networks don’t have complex needs,
so all networking functions are typically

277
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:07,820
provided by a single device which is often
called a home router or wireless router.

278
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,480
There is no need for a dedicated device for
each function.

279
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,390
This one device can serve as a router, connecting
the home network to the Internet.

280
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:20,929
Also a switch, as there are usually a few
switchports on the back to connect other devices

281
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:22,520
to.

282
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,260
Also there are usually simple firewall functions,
typically configured to block all connections

283
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:32,419
coming from the outside network, but to allow
connections to the Internet from internal

284
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:33,770
devices.

285
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:38,670
It also serves as a wireless access point,
allowing you to connect your laptop or phone,

286
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,590
for example, to the network using WiFi.

287
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:47,260
Also in some cases it can serve as a modem
too for cable internet, although sometimes

288
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,380
the modem is a separate device.

289
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:55,490
Here’s an example of a simple home router,
although they come in all shapes and sizes.

290
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:00,059
For very small networks, there’s no need
to have a separate device dedicated to routing,

291
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:06,240
a device dedicated to switching, a device
dedicated to providing wireless access, etc.

292
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,690
This one device can do it all.

293
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,990
So, although an enterprise network would have
these all as separate devices, the home router

294
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,640
combines them all into one small device.

295
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,110
Now, throughout this course we are focusing
on enterprise networking.

296
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:26,350
Very small companies or home offices don’t
have the need, or probably the resources,

297
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,559
to hire a dedicated network engineer.

298
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:34,680
So, they often just rent a wireless router
from the ISP and that serves their purposes.

299
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,750
Here’s a review of what we covered in this
video.

300
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:43,250
First, traditional 2-tier and 3-tier LAN architecture.

301
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:50,240
Make sure you know the three layers, access
distribution and core, and their basic characteristics.

302
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,450
Then I introduced spine-leaf architecture,
which is common in modern data center environments.

303
00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:01,080
Again, make sure you know the basic rules
of spine-leaf and its characteristics.

304
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,710
Finally we took a brief look at SOHO, Small
Office/Home Office, networks.

305
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,830
They are small networks that typically have
a single networking device that provides them

306
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:14,590
with routing, switching, security, and wireless
access.

307
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:19,530
As always, watch until the end of the quiz
for a bonus practice question from Boson Software’s

308
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:24,100
ExSim for CCNA, my recommended practice exams
for the CCNA.

309
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,850
Okay, let’s go to quiz question 1.

310
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,740
Which Layer typically serves as the boundary
between Layer 2 and Layer 3 in a traditional

311
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,230
2-tier or 3-tier network?

312
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:42,870
Pause the video now to select the best answer.

313
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,289
The answer is B, distribution.

314
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:50,289
Typically, the connections from access layer
to distribution layer are Layer 2 and they

315
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:52,429
run spanning tree protocol.

316
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:55,570
The connections from distribution to core
are Layer 3.

317
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:00,490
So, the distribution layer serves as the boundary
between Layer 2 and Layer 3.

318
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,790
Okay, let’s go to question 2.

319
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,530
Which of the following would you NOT expect
to find in the Core Layer of a traditional

320
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,150
3-tier LAN?

321
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:14,710
Pause the video now to select the best answer.

322
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:21,390
Okay, the answer is B, STP, spanning tree
protocol.

323
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,570
Because the connections at the Core Layer
are all Layer 3, spanning tree protocol should

324
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,230
not be running in the core layer.

325
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:31,669
Okay, let’s go to question 3.

326
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:37,630
At which layer would you expect to find PoE-enabled
switchports in a traditional 3-tier LAN?

327
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:42,100
Pause the video now to select the best answer.

328
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:47,500
Okay, the answer is A, Access.

329
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:53,289
Devices that use PoE like wireless access
points, IP phones, and IP security cameras

330
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:58,340
all connect to the access layer, so that’s
where PoE-enabled ports can often be found.

331
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,950
Okay, let’s go to question 4.

332
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,210
In a Spine-Leaf architecture, which of the
following should not be connected to a Leaf

333
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,210
switch?

334
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:14,429
Pause the video now to select the best answer.

335
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:17,320
The answer is B, a leaf switch.

336
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,990
Endpoints like servers can connect to leaf
switches, and each leaf switch should connect

337
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:26,309
to all spine switches, but leaf switches should
not connect to each other.

338
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:30,940
Okay, let’s go to question 5.

339
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,600
Which of the following functions might be
included in the device known as a wireless

340
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,700
router?

341
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,929
Pause the video now to select the best answer.

342
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:47,570
Okay, the answer is F. A wireless router,
also known as a home router, is a multipurpose

343
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:53,601
network device that can provide routing, switching,
wireless access, security features, etc for

344
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:55,350
a small network.

345
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:00,090
This kind of device is often used in SOHO,
Small Office/Home Office, networks.

346
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,679
Okay, that’s all for the quiz.

347
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:07,747
Now let’s take a look at a bonus question
in Boson Software’s ExSim for CCNA.

348
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,920
There are supplementary materials for this
video.

349
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,590
There is a flashcard deck to use with the
software ‘Anki’.

350
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:31,279
There will also be a packet tracer practice
lab, so you can get hands-on practice.

351
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,590
In this case, although we didn’t cover any
configurations in this video I will take the

352
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:40,370
opportunity to demonstrate an important concept
for LANs regarding the interaction between

353
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:45,220
spanning tree protocol and FHRPs such as HSRP.

354
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,340
That will be in the next video.
