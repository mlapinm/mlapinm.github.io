==================== 
7.725266 
hi there my name is Ken Mayer and I'm going to be your instructor for this course 
12.605372
over the last thirty plus years I have worked in a variety of different fields in the world of IT 
17.390206
of course that does include the routing the switching in the security world both for small enterprises large enterprises fortune 100 companies 
25.254877
and over the last 15 years have had the opportunity as a consultant 
29.733738
or as a contractor to be able to work with most of the larger service providers around the world 
33.515313
now I'm hoping that I'll be able to take all of that experience both in the real world 
and in the instructional capability 
40.015012
and be able to give you the information you need to be successful at working with Cisco's routers and switches 
45.837998
so let's first talk about exploring the functions of networking 
51.65428
that means of course to understand the basics about our communications 
55.754434
when we talk about a network what we're talking about is a way for different endpoints to be able to communicate with each other 
63.009497
when I talk about an endpoint I'm talking about a device like a laptop like a computer sitting on your desk 
69.307788
that is not going to take and receive transmissions and then send those transmissions out to a different device 
76.242047
right it's the beginning of a conversation or it's the end of a conversation we call that the endpoint 
81.739262
now that endpoint can be anywhere it could be at a home office a 
small office it could be a user whose 
mobile in today's world it could be part of what we call BYOD bring your own device your smart phones your tablet's all are designed as endpoints 
95.918333
now what we need is to find a way to be able to help facilitate that communications from one endpoint to another 
103.00822
whether it's at a branch office a headquarter or main office 
106.164308
and so that's what we call a network 
108.199228
a network is a the ability for these endpoints to be able to talk to each other 
113.347489
by the way some of the other endpoints that I haven't mentioned are obviously things like your servers
118.355641
your file servers your print servers your email servers 
121.503982
we just call them a server because they are designed to share resources from multiple endpoints 
127.616411
or I guess we'll all just call workstations 
130.556991
so what we're going to do is find a way to be able to make that Communications go back and forth 
136.01063
whether it's from the use of radio frequencies like a wireless network 
141.156341
whether it's the use of copper cables sending electrons or fiber cables sending photons or light down that wire 
148.742168
we're gonna look at the ways in which we can make that connection to help facilitate the communications to get the message from the source to its destination 
157.633904
so in reality as I said before we're looking at the variety of endpoints that we want to have communications work with 
166.682217
and endpoints don't mean again that it's the end of the communication it means they could start or end the communication 
173.363709
but that they're not helping facilitate the communications between each other 
177.676544
in other words if my computer wanted to have this user send a print document 
182.987189
they would send it through a network device 
186.020603
that would look at the address that it wants to be communicated and width 
186.020603
and then help facilitate that communication to the device 
194.133852
so that if the print job could work 
196.039576
so that's where we're looking at the interconnection right here from the switch layer on up 
201.874134
and we'll break this down a little bit to talk about these different layers 
205.409239
but typically we talk about this as the access layer because that the access layer what we're doing is we're making sure 
212.768024
that we are able to access the endpoints 
216.71003
and then of course the larger our network grows the more that we need to have the ability to do what we call scaling of communications 
224.573266
we may start using routers 
226.433002
now I'll explain all about the reason why you would use a router 
over a switch 
231.216297
as we get into the discussion of broadcast domains and so many other things 
235.206713
but we often call that the distribution layer 
238.2557
and we again use it to help facilitate the communications from one place to another 
244.227396
a router can help us within a local office a router can help us in being able to get out to the world of the Internet as well 
252.361885
so as long as these symbols make sense to you 
255.473728
and we'll keep showing these as parts of our diagrams 
258.712506
then I think you'll do OK 
at being able to understand or hopefully interpret the information that I'm trying to share with you 
264.558109
again as we're trying to interpret these diagrams 
270.349595
it's important to remember that whenever you see a PC a server or some other end point 
274.978909
that it's generally going to have an Ethernet connection remember the straight lines where Ethernet cables connecting to us a network device 
284.264008
most often we're connecting to a switch 
286.933581
at the local level again the switch with the square with the arrows moving out 
291.494788
and as we're looking at these diagrams you're seeing the port numbers 
296.547737
and the type of ports that they are that the devices are connecting to 
301.735258
for example F a generally stands for fast ethernet 
307.346578
and when we get into the speeds of Ethernet you'll see that that's generally speed that we always measure in megabits or actually in bits per second 
315.676938
but generally megabits per second 
317.434752
and fast ethernet is designed to be 100 megabits per second 
322.741183
so this is port 0 5.07 port 0 11 now we have another indicator here for a different type of interface 
331.377926
which is one we would call a gigabit 
333.492537
gigabit is again a factor of 10 times faster than fast ethernet 
338.990579
and so gigabit would generally be listed as one gigabit per second 
345.265833
again we're talking about the types of interfaces that were connecting to and that's what it's showing us in the diagram 
353.55571
now when we look at moving through layer 3 
357.715849
we haven't got to the OSI model yet but layer 3 deals with IP addresses 
362.189052
so far everything over here can deal with a layer 2 address 
365.552799
that we call a MAC address 
367.520275
and I promise we're going to get in more discussions about that 
370.240201
but at layer 3 we do need an IP address so generally speaking you're going to see the network address 
376.417859
the 
network address will generally end with a 0 
380.769758
but we have to still talk about the subnet mask 
383.108169
or variable length subnet masking soon 
385.534367
and then specifically we have the host address 
388.398971
that dot 1 means that it would actually replace that 0 
391.707015
and that would be the specific address of that port that is connecting on the 
switch 
398.145023
a dot 2 to replace that 0 the address on the router 
403.59449
and again that is a gigabit connection 
405.474872
and the ports again are designed to just show you which port numbers they are 
410.515563
basically the port number is the last indicator 
413.951043
the first indicator generally is for a multi chassis or multi designed chassis having multiple switches in one box 
423.287958
another and we'll talk more about that in other words if I had a very large switch I may have several of these line cards 
431.485017
and each line card could have multiple ports 
433.268934
and so the first number is telling me which line cards starting with one going or zero going through one two and three 
441.226165
and that would be that first zero that you're seeing here 
444.195838
and then on that line card which port number we're talking about starting with port zero port one etc 
450.615769
and then some communications that we use may use some other medium besides Ethernet 
456.923577
and so this is an example of a serial interface  
460.714438
serial is still about communicating traffic 
it's just using a different protocol 
and a different type of cable for a variety of different reasons to be able to make the communications 
471.610359
now when we are designing a network 
475.307749
you really want to make sure that you understand how user applications can affect your designs 
481.309785
for 
example we have a group of things we may call a batch application 
486.06466
batch applications are generally applications that might require a lot of bandwidth 
491.268171
bandwidth or speed is about how much information I can send down a cable at any one time 
498.130783
and even though they require a lot of bandwidth 
501.223692
they don't necessarily worry about how long it takes for the data to transfer 
505.715486
as long as the data does transfer 
508.197742
in other words I could start some of these applications like a file transfer FTP 
513.700636
the File Transfer Protocol or TFTP the trivial File Transfer Protocol or maybe it's a database doing an inventory update 
522.026288
but I'm sending a large amount of information 
524.532855
and it may 
be okay if some of that transfer is interrupted by other traffic coming through because it's not important 
532.246116
that it gets there in a continuously same speed type of fashion 
538.022096
now these generally have no direct human interaction 
540.795535
we start the programs they start sending out their information and then they finish and report to us when they're done 
547.584194
now there may be some interactive applications where the time it takes to get that information could be important
554.426518 
it could be somebody hitting a webpage 
557.508233
trying to get information from our database about what items we have in inventory 
561.742873
so in that case we have that human to machine interaction 
565.776383
somebody clicked on that request 
567.578706
we're expecting to see the results come back 
569.550267
and we don't want to wait a lot of time to be able to do that 
572.07857
where we actually worry about how long it takes for other people waiting for the response 
577.861818
and response time although important not quite so critical that it can't have a couple of delays in their 
583.948544
real-time applications like voice over IP or video streaming 
588.116254
we do care about
589.47992
because if we're making a phone call over our network 
592.528746
and we have a lot of delay it'll suddenly sound like we're on a CB radio 
596.23208
instead of actually on a phone 
598.168472
or if there's a problem with the transfer of video and we're starting to see delays 
601.784849
and skips making the video experience very bad 
604.710843
or having a problem with the video and the voice coming together at the right time making your video look like a badly dubbed movie 
612.226557
then that causes a lot of problems 
614.666882
that 
is usually a human to human interaction doing voice or video phone calls 
619.991249
and so it's very important that we don't have any delays 
622.624206
and so all of these are considerations you have to come through 
626.558926
when making the design of your network
628.084853 
so we're going to talk about the characteristics of a network 
632.477485
the next couple of our slides are going to talk about the logical and physical topology 
637.502841
but basically the topology is how do we connect one PC to another PC 
644.183992
or to a printer or something else 
646.707137
and that means there has to be some sort of a wire 
649.449351
some sort of a device that can help make what we call a forwarding decision 
653.41888
because there may be more than one destination 
656.146506
and we need to make sure we get our traffic to the right destination 
659.452757
so that we'll look at that topology information in just a little bit 
662.851705
this by the way is my drawing of a switch 
665.79307
I just didn't put all the extra arrows I guess I could therefore you 
668.795623
there we go 
669.494333
so one of the things we do look at a network is speed
672.495455 
speed is sometimes called bandwidth 
675.70529
it's about how much data can I send over this physical cable 
680.175899
there's also the use of cost cost is also important because we'll talk about a variety of speeds 
686.999988
but the faster you want the speed of not only the traffic going over the cable 
691.433297
but the speed in which the device that you use a switch or router can help you in forwarding traffic can also become more expensive generally speaking 
702.41592
we also look at the cost of how many devices can we connect with this switch or router 
708.064626
security is always going to be an issue security is about making sure there's not some hacker out here 
714.694059
that might be a part of your network 
717.066923
that's trying to make a connection and steal communications or break into other people's devices 
723.390306
or even change the way in which your traffic moves across your network 
727.480297
so we are going to talk about some of those issues as well 
730.173697
security not only for the people who are trying to happily use the network 
734.643332
but also security about the device itself that their inter connecting through 
739.436847
availability is our discussion of what we sometimes call the mean time between failure so 
748.900101
what's the odds of a cable breaking what would that do to us 
752.680337
what if the entire switch or router failed how would that affect communications 
757.123138
do we have a plan for having alternate paths 
760.228779
scalability is when we decide to increase the size of our network 
763.998492
scalability would be the discussion of should I add another switch 
768.901292
so I can add a few more endpoint devices into my network 
774.303423
and what would that do to the bandwidth utilization or the amount of traffic that exists on there 
781.722613
as well as reliability reliability still comes back to kind of like availability 
787.908415
letting us get a good understanding of can we suffer a single point of failure in other words if one cable went down again would we have as good of a network 
799.57874
the other part of reliability is what happens when I start introducing voice-over-ip 
804.321852
somebody having a telephone which by the way I draw my telephones like the old dial telephones with a headset on the top 
810.252954
and how would that affect my communications in my network if I don't have either the availability or the reliability of being able to avoid congestion 
822.252208
one of our 
earliest topologies was what we call the bus topology 
827.761553
each of these little spots actually represent an end point basically a computer laptop or something like that 
834.27675
and what a bus topology was known for was that if any message was sent by a computer 
839.391019
it was just a physical cable 
841.846667
kind of like if you've ever plugged a power strip into a wall 
846.070984
instead of having one electrical outlet then you have six electrical outlets everybody gets to share 
851.026525
that energy being sent through and so a bus would basically send your message out to everyone so everybody got to hear it 
859.827579
if 
you go back long enough in time we often call that a party line 
864.060522
or if you have more than one actual landline in your house if you actually have phones that are landlines not cellular 
870.658008
then that was generally a bus topology as well everybody got to hear your conversations 
875.391362
so think of it as a bus line then right we came in there it was like a bus route you hit all of the stops 
882.392307
the star topology was a way of connecting multiple devices 
888.007457
and I'm not quite so sure I like this little circle being in the middle 
890.942829
because generally we had it like a switch even a hub in the older days 
895.58287
that were in the center of this 
897.328566
but all the devices would connect to ports in this in this switch 
901.583852
and so you coming gave you the impression that everything radiated out from the central part kind of where the star topology came from 
910.988746
depending on the actual device if it was a switch and we'll talk about these differences 
917.349217
if a communication went in that device would only send it out to the recipient 
922.132072
and not repeat that information for everybody that's on there 
925.570769
a mesh topology is where I am not connected to any one central device 
931.853862
but whether we have basically let's say maybe a switch or a router
936.442518
that has more than one connection to be able to send traffic so that if any one interface goes down then I still have another way of being able to send my traffic 
946.208038
now the Internet is it a great example of a mesh topology 
949.815344
all of the service providers talk to each other 
953.309702
the service providers have their customers you and I and they facilitate the ability for you and I to talk to customers in their network 
960.935449
or to send our traffic to another service provider 
963.213824
so we can talk to their customers 
966.36563
and so when we look at service providers we often think of them as little clouds 
970.582635
and so again we have all of these little clouds talking to each other 
976.507476
now I'm not going to try to promote any one service provider 
979.135329
but you know who you use for your own internet at home they are a service provider 
983.232285
and the idea of the mesh is that we make sure there's not just one way to get from where we are to where we want to go 
989.209641
it gives us a little bit of fault tolerance 
991.572541
so those are the three primary there is another one that often is talked about it's called a hybrid 
997.341128
a hybrid is sometimes a combination of connecting maybe a bus to a star 
1004.972642
so you have both types of topologies set up for you 
1007.805013
one 
of the most important parts about topologies is what I just talked about was a physical topology 
1015.794269
how the actual cables were laid out 
1017.906087
a logical topology talks about the paths the signals used to travel from one point of a network to another 
1025.165518
and so I want to kind of talk a little bit about that 
1028.486904
and go back in a bit of time 
1030.047624
for example a switch is designed to be a star topology physically and logically 
1036.232576
but before we use switches we used a device called a hub 
1039.462762
and for many of you who are new to this industry a hub and a switch might look very similar to you 
1046.425296
in that it's a a single box with multiple ports 
1050.080617
and our goal was to connect our pcs to each of these ports 
1055.142846
now physically this hub would look like a star 
1060.087529
write it all radiates out from a center device 
1062.903342
but 
actually inside the way in which they were electrically connected was a hub
1070.193972
so that if any transmission went into the switch or hub excuse me 
1075.043343
let me put hub here just so I keep remembering 
1077.407814
it would exit every single port in that device 
1080.837154
so logically it operated like a bus 
1084.402001
physically it looked like a star 
1087.322797
so what we are interested in is both the physical layout physical topology and the logical 
1094.012808
how the paths are used for the signals that are being sent in 
1099.467416
and how they are forwarded and how they travel basically from one point of the network to another 
1104.805983
well the goal of this lesson was to talk about how a network is basically a connection of different devices 
1112.948856
that are designed to communicate with each other what we called endpoints 
1116.658499
there were four major categories of the physical components in a computer network 
1121.839669
those were the endpoints that I called the computers the way in which they were interconnected with the physical cables the switches and the routers 
1129.520674
now of course we can get into detail about any of the ways in which switches and routers work specifically 
1135.393763
but we're just looking at the diagrams 
1137.352866
we talked about the icons that are going to be used to represent these different components of the network 
1141.230314
and we also talked about some of the types of applications 
1144.379439
we want to be able to plan for whether 
1146.664665
they are a batch applications interactive or real-time like voice over IP or video 
1153.054314
we looked at the way in which we describe networks both physically and logically 
1157.919157
as far as the way in which they are designed 
1160.666963
that's what we call the topology 
1162.508323
now within that of course 
we also needed to talk about some of the other ideas between speed cost security availability scalability and reliability 
1171.431511
now remember a physical topology is the way in which the wiring is laid out 
1176.725883
a logical topology was about the paths that the traffic took
