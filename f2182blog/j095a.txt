00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,470
Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:24,150
If you want more labs like this, I highly
recommend Boson Software’s NetSim for CCNA.

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,689
NetSim is a network simulator like Packet
Tracer, but it’s far more powerful and contains

9
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:33,970
over 100 detailed guided labs covering the
CCNA exam topics.

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,240
If you want to get NetSim, follow the link
in the description.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,520
In this video we’ll configure port security
on SW1 and SW2.

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,360
We’ll configure it on SW1’s interfaces
connected to the PCs, and on SW2’s G0/1

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,980
interface, connected to SW1.

14
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,070
Some of the commands I introduced in the lecture
video aren’t supported in packet tracer,

15
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,890
but the most important ones are.

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,170
So, first let’s configure SW1.

17
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:05,530
On the F0/1, 2, and 3 interfaces we’ll enable
port security with the shutdown violation

18
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:12,470
mode, 1 MAC address allowed, sticky learning
disabled, and an aging time of 1 hour.

19
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,590
ENABLE.

20
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,610
CONF T. The port security configuration of
each interface will be the same, so let’s

21
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,950
do INTERFACE RANGE F0/1 – 3.

22
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,909
By default, the violation mode is shutdown,
and the maximum number of MAC addresses allowed

23
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:30,880
is also 1.

24
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,511
Sticky MAC address learning is also disabled
by default, so we don’t have to configure

25
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,640
any of those.

26
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,060
Let’s just set the aging time to 1 hour.

27
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,270
With the default time of 0 minutes, secure
MAC addresses will never age out.

28
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:50,180
SWITCHPORT PORT-SECURITY AGING TIME, and then
enter the time in minutes, 60.

29
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,130
Now, port security itself isn’t actually
enabled yet, so I’ll enable it.

30
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,610
SWITCHPORT PORT-SECURITY.

31
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,479
But the command is rejected, a common mistake
when configuring port security.

32
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,670
These interfaces have the default administrative
mode of DYNAMIC AUTO.

33
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,910
Let’s check one of them.

34
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,319
DO SHOW INTERFACES F0/1 SWITCHPORT.

35
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,200
Up here you can see it, administrative mode
dynamic auto.

36
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,290
To enable port security, the interface must
be manually configured as an access port or

37
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,640
trunk port.

38
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,510
So, SWITCHPORT MODE ACCESS.

39
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,950
Now let’s try again.

40
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,810
SWITCHPORT PORT-SECURITY.

41
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,970
Okay, it should be enabled.

42
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,520
I’ll check one of the interfaces.

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,319
DO SHOW PORT-SECURITY INTERFACE F0/1.

44
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:47,650
Okay, port security is enabled and the default
setting of the violation mode is shutdown.

45
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,900
The aging time of 60 minutes I configured
is shown here.

46
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,740
That’s all we need to configure on SW1.

47
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,560
So let’s move on to SW2.

48
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,599
We’ll configure port security on G0/1 with
the Restrict violation mode, a maximum of

49
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,840
4 addresses, and sticky MAC address learning
enabled.

50
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,410
Why 4 addresses, even though there are only
3 PCs in the network currently?

51
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:19,240
It’s because SW2 will be receiving CDP messages
from SW1, so it will learn SW1’s MAC address

52
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
too.

53
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,819
Okay, let’s configure it.

54
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,209
ENABLE.

55
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,900
CONF T. INTERFACE G0/1.

56
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,959
The default port security violation mode is
shutdown, so let’s configure restrict mode.

57
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,940
SWITCHPORT PORT-SECURITY VIOLATION RESTRICT.

58
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,629
And then the maximum number of addresses.

59
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:45,160
SWITCHPORT PORT-SECURITY MAXIMUM 4.

60
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,099
And then enable sticky MAC address learning.

61
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:52,550
SWITCHPORT PORT-SECURITY MAC-ADDRESS STICKY.

62
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,830
Finally let’s enable port security.

63
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:00,269
There is only 1 VLAN in the network, VLAN
1, so I’ll just configure G0/1 as an access

64
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:03,170
port, although trunk is an option too.

65
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,570
SWITCHPORT MODE ACCESS.

66
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,540
Now I’ll enable port security.

67
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,050
SWITCHPORT PORT-SECURITY.

68
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,880
Okay, let’s check those settings.

69
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,620
DO SHOW PORT-SECURITY INTERFACE G0/1.

70
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,800
Okay, port security is enabled, the violation
mode is restrict, and the maximum number of

71
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,370
addresses is 4.

72
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,530
As for sticky learning, we’ll test that
now.

73
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:35,830
I’ll ping from each PC to R1 so that SW1
and SW2 can learn their MAC addresses.

74
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,419
PC1 first.

75
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:40,950
PING 10.0.0.254.

76
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:47,010
Okay, then PC2.

77
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:51,570
PING 10.0.0.254.

78
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,160
And finally PC3.

79
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,530
PING 10.0.0.254.

80
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:03,160
Okay, now let’s check on SW2.

81
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,760
DO SHOW PORT-SECURITY INTERFACE G0/1.

82
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:14,270
So, the total MAC addresses learned is 4,
PCs 1, 2, 3, and SW1.

83
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,640
And all 4 of those MAC addresses are sticky.

84
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,210
Let’s check the config of G0/1.

85
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,190
DO SHOW RUN.

86
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:29,850
Scroll down to G0/1, and here we can see the
MAC addresses of PC1, PC2, PC3, and this one

87
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,180
here must be SW1.

88
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,740
And let’s check the MAC address table.

89
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,940
DO SHOW MAC ADDRESS-TABLE.

90
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,919
Okay, there are the same 4 MAC addresses.

91
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,440
Notice the type of STATIC, even though they
were dynamically learned.

92
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,470
That’s because of sticky learning.

93
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,830
And one more command, DO SHOW PORT-SECURITY.

94
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:59,300
So, G0/1 has a maximum of 4 secure MAC addresses,
it currently has learned 4, there are 0 security

95
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,840
violations, and the security action is restrict.

96
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,860
Now let’s trigger some violations and see
what happens.

97
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,180
First, I’ll trigger a violation on SW2.

98
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:17,130
To do that, I’ll go on SW1 and configure
the VLAN 1 SVI.

99
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,730
INTERFACE VLAN1.

100
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:24,690
IP ADDRESS 10.0.0.10 255.255.255.0.

101
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,400
NO SHUTDOWN.

102
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,110
Okay, so if SW1 tries to ping R1, the source
MAC address will be the MAC address of the

103
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,070
VLAN 1 SVI.

104
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:40,960
SW2 learned the MAC address of SW1’s G0/1
interface, but it doesn’t know the MAC address

105
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,050
of the VLAN 1 SVI.

106
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,229
So let’s try that ping.

107
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:48,370
DO PING 10.0.0.254.

108
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,130
Okay, the ping isn’t working.

109
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:58,270
That’s because SW2 is blocking the pings
because of the unauthorized source MAC address.

110
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,910
Let’s check on SW2.

111
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,350
DO SHOW PORT-SECURITY INTERFACE G0/1.

112
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:11,669
Okay, notice the port status is still secure-up,
but the violation counter has been incremented.

113
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:17,980
There haven’t been any syslog messages,
that might be an issue with packet tracer.

114
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,550
By default, a syslog message should be displayed
in the console.

115
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,080
Anyway, that’s the restrict mode.

116
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,460
Now let’s trigger a violation on SW1.

117
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,550
To do that, I’ll change the MAC address
of PC1.

118
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:39,069
To do that in packet tracer, go to the config
tab of PC1, click on FastEthernet0, and then

119
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:40,990
change the MAC address here.

120
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,680
I’ll change the last ‘1’ to an ‘A’.

121
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,520
And let’s try to ping R1.

122
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,580
PING 10.0.0.254.

123
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,419
Okay, it doesn’t work this time.

124
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:55,050
Let’s take a look on SW1.

125
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:01,381
Okay, here syslog messages have been shown
for the F0/1 interface being shutdown, but

126
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:04,669
no actual port security related syslog messages.

127
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:08,050
Anyway, let’s check the interface.

128
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,040
DO SHOW PORT-SECURITY INTERFACE F0/1.

129
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:18,210
Okay, the state is secure-shutdown, and the
security violation count is 1.

130
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:23,860
Now, errdisable recovery isn’t available
in packet tracer so if you want to re-enable

131
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,650
the interface, you’ll need to do it manually.

132
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:31,889
Anyway, in this lab we did some basic port
security configurations and observed how the

133
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:34,440
shutdown and restrict violation modes work.

134
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,899
That’s all for this lab.

135
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:43,360
Next, let’s take a look at a bonus lab in
Boson Software’s NetSim for CCNA.
