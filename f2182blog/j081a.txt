of the lab files for this course, so you&nbsp;
can try it out yourself in packet tracer.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,520
If you want more labs like these, I highly&nbsp;
recommend picking up Boson’s NetSim for the CCNA,&nbsp;&nbsp;

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,160
click the link in the video description to check&nbsp;
it out. It’s a network simulator like packet&nbsp;&nbsp;

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,720
tracer, but it’s even better, and it includes&nbsp;
all of these guided labs to not only help you get&nbsp;&nbsp;

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,680
hands-on practice configuring and troubleshooting,&nbsp;
but also deepen your understanding of the exam&nbsp;&nbsp;

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,480
topics. If you want to get NetSim, please&nbsp;
follow the link in the video description.

11
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,880
In this lab we will use Laptop1 to connect to SW2,&nbsp;
a new switch which has not yet been configured.&nbsp;&nbsp;

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,480
Now, in reality you would probably configure&nbsp;
the switch before connecting it to the network,&nbsp;&nbsp;

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:11,440
but I’ve already connected SW2 to R2. So, let’s&nbsp;
get right into it. Step 1 says to connect Laptop1&nbsp;&nbsp;

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,760
to SW2’s console port and perform some basic&nbsp;
configurations. So, from ‘connections’ I’ll select&nbsp;&nbsp;

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:25,600
the console cable, it’s this light blue one. Then,&nbsp;
connect it to Laptop1’s RS232 port, and finally to&nbsp;&nbsp;

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,880
SW2’s console port. Now let’s go on to Laptop1,&nbsp;
and from the desktop tab click on terminal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

17
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,080
These default terminal settings are correct,&nbsp;
so click on OK. And now I’m in the CLI of SW2.

18
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,520
Now let’s perform some basic&nbsp;
configurations. First up, the host name.&nbsp;&nbsp;

19
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:53,840
ENABLE. CONF T. HOSTNAME SW2. Okay, you&nbsp;
can see here the host name has changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

20
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,680
Next let’s set an enable secret. If no enable&nbsp;
secret is set, when you connect via Telnet or SSH&nbsp;&nbsp;

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,960
it won’t let you access privileged exec mode. Now,&nbsp;
there is a way to change that, you can manually&nbsp;&nbsp;

22
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,320
set a high privilege level on the user you create,&nbsp;
but I’ll cover that in a later video on security.&nbsp;&nbsp;

23
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,160
For now just make sure you have an enable secret&nbsp;
configured, so you can access privileged exec mode&nbsp;&nbsp;

24
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,680
when connecting remotely. So, ENABLE SECRET ccna.&nbsp;
These passwords are case-sensitive, by the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

25
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,920
Next, let’s create a login account. I’ll&nbsp;
cover more details about user accounts in&nbsp;&nbsp;

26
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,000
the security section, but the basic command is&nbsp;
USERNAME, then the username, jeremy in this case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

27
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,840
then either PASSWORD or SECRET, I’ll use&nbsp;
SECRET, and finally the password itself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

28
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:51,120
ccna. As I mentioned earlier in the course, if you&nbsp;
use PASSWORD the password is stored in plain text,&nbsp;&nbsp;

29
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,920
not encrypted. Even if you use the&nbsp;
SERVICE PASSWORD-ENCRYPTION command,&nbsp;&nbsp;

30
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,200
the encryption isn’t as strong&nbsp;
as if you use SECRET instead.

31
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,120
Next let’s configure SW2 for remote management&nbsp;
by configuring an IP address on its VLAN1 SVI.&nbsp;&nbsp;

32
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:19,520
INTERFACE VLAN1. IP ADDRESS 192.168.2.253&nbsp;
255.255.255.0. In packet tracer, at least&nbsp;&nbsp;

33
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:25,280
this model of switch, the SVI is shutdown by&nbsp;
default, so let’s enable it with NO SHUTDOWN.&nbsp;&nbsp;

34
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:32,320
Then we get two Syslog messages saying the&nbsp;
interface came up. Okay, finally I’ll configure&nbsp;&nbsp;

35
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:43,360
SW2’s default gateway. EXIT. IP DEFAULT-GATEWAY&nbsp;
192.168.2.254. If a host is in SW2’s local subnet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,200
SW2 can communicate directly with it. However&nbsp;
to communicate with hosts outside of the local&nbsp;&nbsp;

37
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,240
subnet, SW2 needs to know its default gateway,&nbsp;
so that’s why we have to use that command.

38
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,080
Next, in step 2 we’ll configure a few&nbsp;
security settings on the console line.&nbsp;&nbsp;

39
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,920
LINE CONSOLE 0. There is only one&nbsp;
console line, so the number is always 0.&nbsp;&nbsp;

40
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,000
Now let’s configure local authentication. LOGIN&nbsp;&nbsp;

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,920
LOCAL. So, to connect to the console line a user&nbsp;
will have to use the account we configured before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

42
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:24,720
Then, I’ll set the exec timeout. EXEC-TIMEOUT 5.&nbsp;
Note that you don’t have to specify 0 seconds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

43
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,440
you can just specify 5 minutes and then hit enter.&nbsp;
Now to test the local authentication I’ll use END&nbsp;&nbsp;

44
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,000
to return to privileged exec mode, and then&nbsp;
EXIT to log out. Hit enter, and now I’m asked&nbsp;&nbsp;

45
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,880
for a username, jeremy, and a password,&nbsp;
ccna. ENABLE. And again, password of ccna.

46
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,640
Okay, now step 3 is to configure&nbsp;
SW2 for remote access via SSH.&nbsp;&nbsp;

47
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,680
First, let me try to generate&nbsp;
RSA keys. CONF T. CRYPTO KEY&nbsp;&nbsp;

48
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,720
GENERATE RSA. Since SW2 doesn’t have a domain&nbsp;
name yet, it can’t generate the keys. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

49
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,120
let’s specify the domain name.&nbsp;
IP DOMAIN NAME jeremysitlab.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;

50
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:18,320
And now I’ll try to generate the keys again.&nbsp;
CRYPTO KEY GENERATE RSA. And I’ll specify&nbsp;&nbsp;

51
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:26,160
the key modulus size of 2048 bits, and it works.&nbsp;
RSA keys are used for encryption and decryption,&nbsp;&nbsp;

52
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,760
by the way. I’ll give some more detail in&nbsp;
the security section of the course. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

53
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,840
now before configuring the VTY lines I’m going&nbsp;
to configure an ACL to limit access to PC1 only.&nbsp;&nbsp;

54
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:48,800
I’ll just use a simple standard ACL. ACCESS-LIST&nbsp;
1 PERMIT HOST 192.168.1.1. I want to limit access&nbsp;&nbsp;

55
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,680
to SSH only, no Telnet, but we can do that with&nbsp;
the TRANSPORT INPUT SSH command so there isn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

56
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:05,840
actually any need to specify the port in the ACL.&nbsp;
Now I’ll configure the VTY lines. LINE VTY 0 15.&nbsp;&nbsp;

57
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,880
First I’ll configure local authentication. LOGIN&nbsp;
LOCAL. And the same 5 minute exec timeout as&nbsp;&nbsp;

58
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:22,080
on the console lines. EXEC-TIMEOUT 5. Then I’ll&nbsp;
restrict access to SSH only, TRANSPORT INPUT SSH.&nbsp;&nbsp;

59
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,440
And finally, apply the ACL I configured&nbsp;
before. ACCESS-CLASS 1 IN. That’s it.

60
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,480
So, let’s test it out. First, I’ll try from R2,&nbsp;
which shouldn’t be able to connect because of&nbsp;&nbsp;

61
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:50,080
the ACL. First, I’ll try a ping. ENABLE. PING&nbsp;
192.168.2.253. Okay, so R2 is able to ping SW2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

62
00:06:50,880 --> 00:07:02,320
How about SSH? SSH -L jeremy 192.168.2.253.&nbsp;
And the connection is refused by SW2. Perfect.&nbsp;&nbsp;

63
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,880
Next I’ll try from PC1, which should be able&nbsp;
to SSH because the ACL permits PC1 only.&nbsp;&nbsp;

64
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,840
First I’ll try to ping SW2&nbsp;
from PC1. PING 192.168.2.253.&nbsp;&nbsp;

65
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:24,240
The ARP process can be slow in packet tracer, so&nbsp;
a few pings might fail, but after that the pings&nbsp;&nbsp;

66
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:38,320
will succeed. So, PC1 can reach SW2 with ping,&nbsp;
how about SSH? SSH -L jeremy 192.168.2.253. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

67
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:46,080
enter the password of ccna and we’re in. So, PC1&nbsp;
was able to connect to the CLI of SW2 using SSH.

68
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,480
In this lab we configured&nbsp;
some console line security,&nbsp;&nbsp;

69
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,520
and enabled SW2 for remote access via SSH.&nbsp;&nbsp;

70
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:00,640
That’s all for this lab. Now let’s take a look at&nbsp;
a bonus lab in Boson Software’s NetSim for CCNA.

71
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,080
Okay here's today's Boson NetSim practice lab.&nbsp;
The lab I have selected is configuring SSH.&nbsp;&nbsp;

72
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,720
So, we will configure SSH here on Router1 in this&nbsp;
lab. These are the commands you need to know.&nbsp;&nbsp;

73
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,000
We covered almost all of the commands, but there&nbsp;
is one or two that I didn't cover in the lecture&nbsp;&nbsp;

74
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,080
video. Okay, so those are the commands, and&nbsp;
the lab tasks. There are two tasks with quite&nbsp;&nbsp;

75
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,760
a few steps but they're all pretty quick so&nbsp;
I think we'll do the whole lab in this video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

76
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,760
So let's get right to it. First, from PC1 we'll&nbsp;
attempt to ping this subinterface on Router1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

77
00:08:44,400 --> 00:09:00,000
So, 10.10.0.1. And okay, so two of&nbsp;
them timed out and then the others&nbsp;&nbsp;

78
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,040
went through. So PC1 does have&nbsp;
reachability, it can ping Router1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

79
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,800
Next, in step 2 we will attempt to&nbsp;
Telnet to that same interface. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

80
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,840
Okay, looks like it works. What is the&nbsp;
password? It says right here, boson.&nbsp;&nbsp;

81
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,120
Okay, so we are able to Telnet to Router1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

82
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:35,760
And then for step 3 I exited out of that Telnet&nbsp;
session. Step 4, we will try to SSH to Router1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

83
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:52,160
And the connection is refused by Router1. Okay,&nbsp;
so the SSH session fails. And step 5, on Router1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

84
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,320
okay let me open up a connection, determine&nbsp;
whether SSH is enabled or disabled. Okay so the&nbsp;&nbsp;

85
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:13,120
command is SHOW IP SSH. And it is disabled. Okay,&nbsp;
attempt to enable SSH version 2. Was it enabled?&nbsp;&nbsp;

86
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:23,280
Let me see, IP SSH VERSION 2 is the command. And&nbsp;
it tells us to create RSA keys to enable SSH.&nbsp;&nbsp;

87
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:35,440
Okay, so next in step 7 let's create those RSA&nbsp;
keys. CRYPTO KEY GENERATE RSA. But it doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

88
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:42,960
work because Router1 does not have a domain name&nbsp;
configured. So I'll configure that. IP DOMAIN NAME&nbsp;&nbsp;

89
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:53,680
boson.com. And then one more time, in step 9 we&nbsp;
will create those RSA keys. And it works. So the&nbsp;&nbsp;

90
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:04,480
modulus size is 1024 bits, okay. Next, step 10.&nbsp;
Configure an SSH session timeout of 90 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

91
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,600
Okay, so this is a command I didn't&nbsp;
mention in the lecture video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

92
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,800
It is..actually first, let me check&nbsp;
the second part. What is the default&nbsp;&nbsp;

93
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:22,480
and maximum timeout value? You can view that&nbsp;
with this command again. Here, 120 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

94
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,880
So, to configure it it's IP SSH&nbsp;
TIME-OUT, and we'll set it to 90.&nbsp;&nbsp;

95
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,560
Okay, and then finally enable SSH&nbsp;
version 2. I think it already is enabled,&nbsp;&nbsp;

96
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:46,160
it says it here. But I'll enter that&nbsp;
command once more. IP SSH VERSION 2, okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

97
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,520
Okay, step 12. Configure a local username that has&nbsp;
a password of boson and privilege level 15. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

98
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,200
so we will configure a privilege level. I didn't&nbsp;
mention this yet, but the command is USERNAME&nbsp;&nbsp;

99
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:13,040
admin PRIVILEGE 15, that's the maximum, and it&nbsp;
says PASSWORD, so not SECRET, PASSWORD boson.&nbsp;&nbsp;

100
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:23,840
Okay and then step 13, we will configure&nbsp;
the VTY lines to allow only SSH. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

101
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:40,240
0 15. And TRANSPORT INPUT SSH. Okay so now let's&nbsp;
try that SSH again in task 2, verify SSH access.&nbsp;&nbsp;

102
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,720
So from PC1 let's try that again. Same command,&nbsp;
and it works. We are asked for the password. That&nbsp;&nbsp;

103
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:56,080
means we were able to connect. The password is&nbsp;
boson, and there we go. Oh, no password set,&nbsp;&nbsp;

104
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:04,480
okay. While, the SSH session is active, verify the&nbsp;
SSH version and key size used for the session. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

105
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,680
we didn't set an enable password, so I can't&nbsp;
enable. I could go straight to Router1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

106
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:20,640
Here, I'll tell you what. ENABLE SECRET boson.&nbsp;
And then go back to the SSH session here on PC1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

107
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:30,800
And now we are able to use ENABLE. The&nbsp;
password is boson, there we go. SHOW SSH&nbsp;&nbsp;

108
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,880
gives us information about the current SSH&nbsp;
sessions. So this is different than SHOW&nbsp;&nbsp;

109
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:44,480
IP SSH. SHOW SSH tells you about the current&nbsp;
connections. So, connection 0 is using version&nbsp;&nbsp;

110
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:51,520
2. This is the kind of encryption used. It gives&nbsp;
us information about the state, and the username.&nbsp;&nbsp;

111
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,720
Okay, while the SSH session is active, determine&nbsp;
the username, okay I just pointed that out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

112
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:09,840
it's here, admin. Exit the SSH session.&nbsp;
And then attempt to Telnet. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

113
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:16,880
so we configured TRANSPORT INPUT SSH,&nbsp;
so this should fail. TELNET 10.10.0.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

114
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,080
And the connection is refused. Okay, so that was&nbsp;
a quick look at Boson Software's NetSim for CCNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

115
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,800
As you can see here there are tons&nbsp;
of practice labs for the CCNA,&nbsp;&nbsp;

116
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,400
so if you want some extra guided, detailed&nbsp;
practice labs I highly recommend Boson&nbsp;&nbsp;

117
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,720
NetSim. If you want to get NetSim, please&nbsp;
