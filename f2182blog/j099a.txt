6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,440
Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:24,439
If you want more labs like this, I highly
recommend Boson Software’s NetSim for CCNA.

8
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,949
NetSim is a network simulator like Packet
Tracer, but it’s far more powerful and contains

9
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,050
over 100 detailed guided labs covering the
CCNA exam topics.

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,360
If you want to get NetSim, follow the link
in the description.

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,440
In this lab we’ll practice some of the dynamic
ARP inspection configurations we looked at

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,290
in the lecture video.

13
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,230
Unfortunately, packet tracer doesn’t support
all of the DAI commands we covered, but we

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,360
can still set up the basics.

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,829
Before that, we’ll configure R1 as a DHCP
server and also enable DHCP snooping on SW1

16
00:00:57,829 --> 00:00:59,510
and SW2 for review.

17
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:06,500
So, let’s get right into step 1 and configure
R1 as a DHCP server.

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,850
ENABLE.

19
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,870
CONF T. First, I’ll configure the range
of excluded addresses, since it’s configured

20
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:20,750
separately from 
the DHCP pool.

21
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,870
IP DHCP EXCLUDED-ADDRESS 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.9.

22
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,750
Okay, now the pool.

23
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,970
IP DHCP POOL POOL1.

24
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,729
First, the address range.

25
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:38,020
NETWORK 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0.

26
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,159
And then I’ll configure R1 as the default
gateway.

27
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,780
DEFAULT-ROUTER 192.168.1.1.

28
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,369
Okay, that’s all I’ll configure on R1.

29
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:53,689
Next up, I’ll configure DHCP snooping on
SW1 and SW2.

30
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:59,909
I don’t specify the exact settings you should
use, so let’s just configure the basics.

31
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,460
Enable it, and configure the appropriate trusted
ports.

32
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,820
SW1 first.

33
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,010
ENABLE.

34
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:11,090
CONF T. IP DHCP SNOOPING.

35
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,360
That command enables it globally, but it also
needs to be enabled per VLAN.

36
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,470
IP DHCP SNOOPING VLAN 1.

37
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,220
And then I’ll remove option 82.

38
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,800
NO IP DHCP SNOOPING INFORMATION OPTION.

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,140
Finally, I’ll configure G0/2 as a trusted
port.

40
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,360
INTERFACE G0/2.

41
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,510
IP DHCP SNOOPING TRUST.

42
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,700
EXIT.

43
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,860
Now, as for G0/1 it could be either trusted
or untrusted.

44
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,340
Untrusted is more secure since it could catch
any DHCP messages that might have slipped

45
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,520
past SW2, perhaps due to a misconfiguration.

46
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,350
But it also takes more processing power on
SW1.

47
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:59,970
I’ll leave it as untrusted as I recommended
in the DHCP snooping videos.

48
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,370
Okay, now SW2.

49
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,260
ENABLE.

50
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,360
CONF T. IP DHCP SNOOPING.

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,230
IP DHCP SNOOPING VLAN 1.

52
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,450
And remove option 82.

53
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,670
NO IP DHCP SNOOPING INFORMATION OPTION.

54
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,620
And then I’ll trust G0/1.

55
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,650
INTERFACE G0/1 IP DHCP SNOOPING TRUST.

56
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,800
EXIT.

57
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,920
Okay that’s all for DHCP snooping.

58
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,680
Since I’m on SW2, I’ll configure DAI here
first.

59
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,190
IP ARP INSPECTION VLAN 1.

60
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,900
Okay, it’s enabled for VLAN 1.

61
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,690
Now, the instructions say to enable all additional
validation checks, so I’ll do that now.

62
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:51,280
IP ARP INSPECTION VALIDATE, and let me check
the options.

63
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,580
As I demonstrated in the lecture video, to
enable all three checks you have to enter

64
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,010
them in a single command, although the order
doesn’t matter.

65
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,110
So, DST-MAC, IP, SRC-MAC.

66
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,250
Okay, I’ll confirm in the running config
later.

67
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,730
Now I’ll trust SW2’s G0/1 interface since
it’s connected to SW1.

68
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,570
INTERFACE G0/1.

69
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,280
IP ARP INSPECTION TRUST.

70
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,830
Okay that’s all, so I’ll use END to return
to privileged exec mode.

71
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,400
Let’s check the configuration.

72
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,410
SHOW RUN.

73
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:33,660
Right here at the top, we can see the DAI
configuration, and the DHCP snooping configuration.

74
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:40,060
And if I look down at G0/1, it is trusted
for both DHCP snooping and DAI.

75
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,950
Now let’s check a DAI show command.

76
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,630
SHOW IP ARP INSPECTION INTERFACES.

77
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:51,940
Okay, notice that all interfaces are untrusted
by default, only G0/1 is trusted because we

78
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,210
configured it.

79
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,850
However, there is a difference here.

80
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,350
Rate limiting is enabled at 15 packets per
second on the untrusted ports, but on the

81
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,360
trusted port too.

82
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,710
This is different than what I showed in the
lecture video.

83
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,310
According to Cisco’s documentation, as well
as my own physical and virtual switches that

84
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,350
I tested it on, rate limiting should not be
enabled on trusted ports by default.

85
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:20,750
So, I’m not sure if this is an error in
packet tracer or perhaps it’s due to a different

86
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,560
IOS version.

87
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,280
But as I said, Cisco documentation states
that rate limiting should be disabled by default

88
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,700
on trusted ports, and my own testing on multiple
switches had the same results, so I think

89
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,630
this is an error in packet tracer.

90
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,990
Anyway, let’s move on to SW1.

91
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,480
I’ll do the same DAI configurations.

92
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,920
IP ARP INSPECTION VLAN 1.

93
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:50,960
IP ARP INSPECTION VALIDATE DST-MAC, IP, SRC-MAC.

94
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,290
In SW1’s case, I’ll configure both G0/1
and G0/2 as trusted ports.

95
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,800
INTERFACE RANGE G0/1 – 2.

96
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,270
IP ARP INSPECTION TRUST.

97
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,270
END.

98
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,460
Let’s check the config.

99
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,460
SHOW RUN.

100
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:13,030
There’s the DAI and DHCP snooping configs,
let’s look at the interfaces.

101
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:20,360
Notice G0/2 is trusted for both DAI and DHCP
snooping, but G0/1 is trusted only for DAI.

102
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,920
That’s just how I set up the network, but
there are other options too.

103
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,450
The most important thing is to make sure that
the interface connected to the router, G0/2,

104
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:36,521
is trusted for both DAI and DHCP snooping,
but G0/1 could be trusted or untrusted, that

105
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,300
choice is up to you.

106
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:45,210
Finally, let’s see if the PCs can successfully
get IP addresses via DHCP and then ping the

107
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,230
default gateway.

108
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:53,840
So, I’ll go into PC1 and change this gateway
setting from static to DHCP, and that should

109
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,630
automatically change the FastEthernet0 setting
to DHCP too, and it does.

110
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,610
Now I’ll do that on PC2.

111
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,080
Change from static to DHCP.

112
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,230
And on PC3, too.

113
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,400
Change from static to DHCP.

114
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,990
Now I’ll go into the CLI of PC1.

115
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:20,800
And here we can see its IP address, so it
has successfully gotten an IP address via

116
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
DHCP.

117
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,330
Let’s see if it’s allowed to ping.

118
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,980
If not, there is likely a problem with DAI.

119
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,639
I’ll ping R1.

120
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,220
PING 192.168.1.1.

121
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,590
Okay it works, looks good.

122
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:43,230
So, in this lab we configured DHCP, DHCP snooping,
and then dynamic ARP inspection.

123
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:48,260
As I said at the beginning, unfortunately
not all commands are supported in packet tracer,

124
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,889
but you can still practice the basics.

125
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:52,199
That’s all for this lab.

126
00:07:52,199 --> 00:08:03,780
Now let’s take a look at a lab in Boson
Software’s NetSim for CCNA.
