Thanks for your help. Let’s get started.
22.560
In this lab you’ll practice and develop your understanding of some of the concepts
26.130
learned in the day 5 and day 6 videos on Ethernet LAN Switching.
31.800
As you can see, the network topology we will use in this lab is like the example network
36.460
I used in those previous lecture videos, with two switches, each with 2 PCs connected to them.
43.289
Let’s get started and go through the steps.
47.390
First off, there is a note saying that both switches have an empty MAC address table,
52.199
and all PCs have an empty ARP table.
55.359
Keep that in mind as you try to answer step 1, which asks us, if PC1 pings to PC3, what
62.350
messages will be sent over the network, and which devices will receive them?
66.700
So, if PC1 wants to send a ping to PC3, it has to know PC3’s MAC address.
74.229
We can type ping 192.168.1.3 on PC1 to send a ping, but until PC1 knows PC3’s MAC address,
84.079
it can't send the ping.
86.240
That means PC1 will have to send an ARP request.
89.030
So, that’s the first message.
91.789
Now, which devices will receive the ARP request?
95.040
Well, the ARP request is a broadcast message, so ALL devices on the local network will receive
100.390
it, except for PC1 of course, which sends the message.
104.750
PC2 and PC4 will ignore the message, but then PC3 will send an ARP reply, which is the second message.
113.159
Unlike the ARP request, which is a broadcast message, the ARP reply is a unicast message,
119.409
so the message will be sent through SW2 and SW1, and then be received by PC1 only, no
125.601
copies of the message will be sent to PC2 or PC4.
129.429
Then, PC1 will be able to add PC3’s MAC Address to its ARP table, and use that information
136.180
as the destination address of its ping.
139.040
So, the third message that will be sent is an ICMP echo request, from PC1.
145.480
This is a unicast message that will be received by PC3 only.
150.000
Then, PC3 will send an ICMP echo reply, which is also a unicast message that will be received
156.890
by PC1 only, after passing through SW2 and SW1 of course.
162.320
So, that’s it, those are the messages that will be sent over the network if PC1 pings PC3.
168.030
Now, there won’t be just one ping, PC1 will send multiple pings, 4 by default from a windows PC.
176.940
Step 2 asks us to send the ping and use Packet tracer’s ‘simulation mode’ to verify our answer.
183.470
First, let me click on simulation mode here in the bottom right.
187.930
Then, to send a ping from a PC in packet tracer, click on the PC, click on desktop, and click on command prompt.
197.760
Now just type in the command.
199.500
PC3’s IP address is 192.168.1.3, so the command is ping 192.168.1.3.
209.000
Immediately, you can see that both an ICMP message, the ping, and an ARP message appear.
216.900
I’ll click on the ICMP message, and then click on Layer 2.
222.530
Look at the info here.
224.510
The next-hop address is a unicast.
227.870
The ARP process looks it up in the ARP table, but the next-hop IP address is not in the ARP table.
235.579
The ARP process tries to send an ARP request for that IP address and buffers this packet.
241.840
Buffers means it holds the packet, so it can send it later.
246.170
Now let’s click on the ARP message, and look here at the information.
250.590
This time I’ll click on ‘Outbound PDU details’, which shows us detailed information
255.360
about the frame. Do you recognize these fields?
259.640
Preamble, SFD, destination address, source address, type, data, which is the encapsulated
268.630
packet, and then FCS.
271.690
If you watched my last two videos, you should recognize all of these fields of the Ethernet header and trailer.
278.400
Notice in particular the TYPE field of 0806, which indicates ARP, and the destination MAC
286.009
address of all F’s, which is the broadcast address.
289.889
Okay, now I’ll exit from here and click through the process...the ARP reaches SW1,
297.229
is broadcast to PC2 and SW2, and then broadcast to PC3 and PC4.
304.900
Only PC3 replies, this time with a unicast message which arrives at SW2, then SW1, and then PC1.
313.070
PC1 can then, finally, send its ICMP echo request, which is unicast and goes to SW1,
320.840
SW2, and then PC3.
323.760
PC3 then sends the ICMP echo reply back through SW2, SW1, and then arriving at PC1.
332.400
I’ll just press this play button, and you can see the rest of the pings being sent between PC1 and PC3.
341.900
There should be 4 in total, as these Packet Tracer PCs operate like windows PCs.
348.389
Cisco devices, however, send 5 pings by default.
351.930
Now, Step 3 tells us to generate network traffic and allow the switches to learn all MAC address of the PCs on the network.
360.960
Remember, switches dynamically learn and enter MAC addresses into their MAC address table
366.690
by looking at the source address field of frames they receive.
370.230
So, since we just pinged between PC1 and PC3, both switches should know their MAC addresses,
377.210
but just in case I’ll switch back to realtime mode...and send one more ping from PC1 to PC3,
383.640
because sometimes Packet Tracer has problems with simulation mode.
388.789
Okay, next let’s send a ping from PC2 to PC4 so that the switches can learn their MAC addresses.
396.300
I’ll go on PC2, and now I’ll ping PC4. Ping 192.168.1.4.
408.360
Step 4 asks us to use show commands on the switches to identify the MAC address of each PC.
415.030
Because the interface each PC is connected to is displayed on the network diagram, if
419.851
we look for that interface in the MAC address table we will be able to identify the MAC
424.540
address of each PC.
425.759
I’ll go on SW1.
429.360
We have to be in privileged exec mode to view the MAC address table.
433.060
So, use the command enable, or just 'en'.
438.539
The command to view the mac address table is show mac SPACE address HYPHEN table.
444.110
Make sure you don’t mix up the space and hyphen.
448.699
Okay, first of all let’s find PC1, which is attached to the fastethernet 0/1 interface.
455.199
Here it is, and you can see the MAC address here.
460.069
Note that the MAC address in your lab maybe different, I’m not sure if packet tracer
463.879
keeps the MAC addresses consistent if you load the labs up on another computer. How about PC2?
470.930
Well, its connected to Fastethernet0/2, so here is PC2’s MAC address.
477.759
Now, as for PC3 and PC4, we have a problem.
482.349
SW1 only knows that it can reach these two MAC addresses via gigabit ethernet 0/1.
488.569
Just by looking at this MAC table, we don’t know which address belongs to PC3 and which belongs to PC4.
495.000
So, let’s go on to SW2. Once again, I’ll enter privileged exec mode, enable.
504.669
Now let’s view the MAC address table. Show mac address-table.
509.389
PC3 is connected to fastethernet 0/1, so this must be its MAC address, and PC4 is connected
518.160
to fastethernet 0/2, so this must be its MAC Address.
523.420
We have successfully used the show mac address table command to identify the MAC address of each PC.
530.480
Now let’s do step 5, which is to clear the dynamic MAC addresses from the mac address table of each switch.
536.690
Since I’m already on SW2, I’ll start here.
541.190
The command is clear mac address-table dynamic, but before I hit enter, I want to show you something.
548.370
I’ll use the question mark, which is also known as 'context-sensitive help'.
554.270
As you can see, it doesn’t display any additional options here.
558.080
If you remember from the day 6 lecture video when I did the demonstration in GNS3 I could clear
564.031
specific MAC addresses by specifying the address or interface.
569.340
Packet tracer, however, does not support this option, you have to clear all MAC addresses.
575.060
So I enter the command, then I’ll use the up arrow on the keyboard to go back to the
580.270
show mac address-table command, enter it once more, and you can see the mac address-table is now empty.
586.640
I’ll do the same on SW1.
591.310
Clear mac address-table dynamic.
594.220
Press the up arrow twice to go back to the show mac address-table command, hit enter,
600.200
and there we go, the address table is now empty.
603.370
We have successfully completed this lab.
