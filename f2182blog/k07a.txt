welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab you can download the lab

file from the link in the description in

this lab we will be working with one

router r1 2 switches switch 1 and switch

2 and 4 pcs pc-1 pc2 pc 3 and PC 4 we

will configure these pcs to be in two

separate VLANs and then configure

routing between them through the method

known as router on a stick the host

names of the router and switches the IP

addresses of the pcs and their default

gateways have been pre-configured try to

complete the lab yourself first and then

continue watching if you have trouble or

watch it after to check your solution

step one is to ping between the PCs

things between PC one and PC through

should succeed because they are in the

same subnet likewise pings between PC 2

and pc 4 should succeed because they are

also in the same subnet other pings

should fail let's ping from pc1 first

let's ping PC to ping 1000 130 the ping

fails next let's ping PC 3 ping 1000 3

the ping works as expected

finally let's ping PC for ping 1000 131

the ping fails by the way I'm using the

up arrow to access previous commands and

just edit the last few numbers next

let's try to ping from PC to first PC 1

ping 1000 to the ping fails next PC 3

ping 1000 3

the pin fails finally pc4 ping 1000 dot

131 the ping works that's step one step

two is to assign pc1 & pc2 VLAN 13 & pc2

and pc 4 to VLAN 24 let's configure

switch 1 first enable compte interface

f01 switch port mode access switch port

access VLAN 13 that's for a pc 1 next

for pc 2 interface f0 to switch port

mode access switch port access VLAN 24

next let's configure switch to enable

compte interface f01 switch port mode

access switch port access VLAN 13 that's

pc 3 next let's configure the interface

connected to pc 4 interface f0 to switch

ports mode access switch port access

VLAN 20 for step two is now complete

step three is to create a trunk link

between switch 1 and switch to remember

we need to configure a trunk link to

allow the connection between switch 1

and switch two to carry traffic from

multiple VLANs in this case the

interfaces are assigned to the native

VLAN VLAN 1 however our pcs are assigned

to either VLAN 13 or VLAN 24 therefore

no traffic from these pcs will be able

to pass between the switches even in the

same VLAN I'll just do one ping to prove

this from pc1 to pc2 are in the same

VLAN ping 1000 3 as you can see the ping

which succeeded previously now fails

let's create a trunk now I'll configure

switch 1 first interface g0 to switch

port mode trunk that's it

on this switch model we don't have to

configure the encapsulation type next

let's configure switch to interface g0 1

switch port mode trunk that's step 3

step four is to configure inter VLAN

routing by creating sub interfaces on r1

currently because we created a trunk

between switch 1 and switch 2 pcs in the

same VLAN can ping each other again I'll

ping once more from pc1 to pc2 show this

ping 1000 3 as you can see there are

once again no problems

however pings to a different VLAN should

not work let's just ping from pc1 to pc2

check King 1000 131 as you can see the

ping fails now one way of configuring

inter VLAN routing the one we will be

using in this lab is called router on a

stick as you can see there is only one

connection between r1 and switch one

however we will configure two sub

interfaces using the single connection

and each sub interface will have a

separate IP address which serves as the

default gateway for the pcs in each VLAN

note that I have already configured the

pcs with their default gateways so let's

configure r1 enable comte first I will

turn on the Gigabit Ethernet 0 0

interface which is shut down by default

interface G 0 0 no shutdown next let's

configure the sub interface for VLAN 13

first type interface G 0 0 as normal

then dot 13 as you can see we are in sub

interface configuration mode I'll set

the IP address to 1001 so IP address

1001 with the subnet mask of

255.255.255.0

is equivalent to

25 but the command doesn't work we have

to configure this sub interface as part

of a VLAN first that is done with this

command encapsulation dot1q 13 now we

can configure the IP address IP address

1000 1 255.255.255.192 face for VLAN 24

interface g0 0.24 we will use an IP

address of 1000 1 2 9 and a subnet mask

of 255.255.255.0 - we have to configure

the encapsulation encapsulation dot1q 24

IP address 1000 dot 1 to 9 255 dot 255

dot 255 dot 1 to 8 the configuration of

r1 is now complete however there is one

more final step remember that switch

ones interfaces are access ports in the

native VLAN VLAN 1 by default that

includes Gigabit Ethernet 0 1 which is

connected to r1 so it can't send traffic

from VLAN 13 or VLAN 24 to r1 let's make

it a trunk interface g0 1 switch port

mode trunk ok

step 4 is complete

finally let's test this small Network

all pcs should be able to ping each

other even though they're in separate

VLANs

as in the beginning of the lab helping

each other PC from pc1 and from PC to to

check let's go to PC one first

first I'll paint PC to ping 1000 130 it

works

next I'll ping pc3 ping 1000 3 it works

as well and finally PC for ping 1000 won

3-1 it works ok next let's ping from PC

to first up in PC 1 ping 1000 2 and it

works next PC 3 ping 1000 3 it works as

well and finally PC for ping 1000 131 it

works too

we have successfully configured inter

VLAN routing
