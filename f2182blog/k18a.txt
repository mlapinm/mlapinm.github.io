welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab 4.345563you can download the lab

file from the link in the description 7.628451in

this lab we will take another look at

the port security function of Cisco

switches 13.375586specifically we will learn

about the sticky MAC address function
18.143208
the sticky MAC address function of port

security saved secure MAC addresses into

the switch configuration 24.561384when they are

dynamically learned on a switch port

with port security enabled 28.865184try to

complete this lab yourself first 32.105499then

continue watching this video if you have

trouble or watch it after to check your

solution 37.100898there are a few more steps in

this lab than in my previous labs 41.728882but

these are all pretty short steps 43.440883step

one is to enable port security on the

switch ports connected to end hosts
49.305773
let's go on switch one first 52.136987enable

counf T interface F 0 2 59.324556remember we have

to set the interface as an access port

first 63.868451so switch port mode access 67.024898switch

port port security 69.564311that's all for switch

1 now let's do the same on switch 2
73.686722
enable conf t interface F 0 2 switch

port mode access 82.548547switch port port

security 84.993764now let's go straight into step

2 88.467634which is to ping from pc1 to pc2 91.469396to

generate traffic between them 93.620753remember

that no traffic is passing between these

pcs by default 98.490261so the switches won't

learn the MAC addresses of the PCs 101.751385until

we send some traffic between them 103.983482I'll

ping from PC one 106.340348ping 192.168.1.12

there we go 114.831355step 3 is to view the secure

MAC addresses on switch 1 120.817022I'll go back

to switch 1 123.037859and now I'll use the command

show port security address 130.401318as in the

previous lab
131.868589
as you can see there is a dynamically

learned secure MAC address on the Fast

Ethernet 0 2 interface 138.927039which must be PC

ones 141.475942step four says to check the

configuration of switch ones Fast

Ethernet 0 to interface in the running

configuration 150.981838show running config 154.028618here

it is as you can see there are only the

two commands we entered before 160.911008switch

port mode access and switch port port

security 164.928422remember this as we will

contrast it with sticky mag address

configuration later 170.861465step 5 is to save

the running config and reload the switch
175.782073
I'll use write to save then reload 180.11067ok

now the switch is reloading 184.704112step 6 is to

view the secure MAC addresses on switch

1 again 195.112728do you think PC ones MAC address

will still be saved as a secure MAC

address 200.722924we saved the running

configuration but PC ones MAC address

wasn't anywhere in the running

configuration 208.361641so let's check the port

security address table again 213.068455enable show

port security address 217.6333as you can see PC

ones MAC address is no longer present
222.268412
dynamically learned secure MAC addresses

will not be retained when you restart

the switch 227.983235even if you save the running

configuration because the address isn't

actually entered into the runner

configuration when it is dynamically

learned 235.363753step 7 is to enable the sticky

secure MAC address feature on switch

ones

f02 interface 244.266878conf t interface f0 2 249.13973now

this feature is enabled with this

command 252.65166switch port port security MAC

address sticky 258.736498that's it
260.519249
now let's ping between the PCs again to

generate traffic
264.368246
on PC one ping 192.168.1.11 271.617883that's all

for step 7 274.760441step 8 is to view the secure

MAC addresses of switch 1 281.388544then the

running config 283.143796so on switch 1 show port

security address 288.849657there is PC ones MAC

address again 291.802717this time it is listed as

a secure sticky address 295.151737what's the

difference well let's check the running

configuration 300.03205show run as you can see in

addition to the three commands we

manually configured on the interface
309.1951
there is a fourth one which we didn't

configure 311.926622switch port port security MAC

address sticky 316.075433followed by PC ones MAC

address 318.387568this is because we enabled the

sticky feature 322.326921when this feature is

enabled the switch saves dynamically

learned secure MAC addresses to the

running configuration of the switch 329.909723step

nine is to save the running

configuration and reload again 335.938255let's do

that 337.229666 write reload
340.319308
step 10 is to view the secure MAC

addresses on switch one once again 351.921145this

time do you expect to see PC ones MAC

address in the table 357.277171PC ones MAC address

was saved to the running configuration

of switch 1 361.95219and we saved the running

configuration before reloading 365.295647so it

should be in the table even after

restarting 368.594705let's check 371.021187enable show port

security address 376.133495as expected PC ones MAC

address is still saved as a secure MAC

address on the f02 interface 384.595637so to

review without the sticky feature

enabled dynamically learned secure MAC

addresses are not retained when the

switch is reloaded 393.555175the sticky MAC

address learning feature however

automatically saves these addresses to

the running configuration 400.4179and thus will

be retained upon reload if the runner

configuration is saved 404.812631that's all for
