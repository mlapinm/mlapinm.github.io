welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab you can download the lab

file from the link in the description in

this lab we will take another look at

the port security function of Cisco

switches specifically we will learn

about the sticky MAC address function

the sticky MAC address function of port

security saved secure MAC addresses into

the switch configuration when they are

dynamically learned on a switch port

with port security enabled try to

complete this lab yourself first then

continue watching this video if you have

trouble or watch it after to check your

solution there are a few more steps in

this lab than in my previous labs but

these are all pretty short steps step

one is to enable port security on the

switch ports connected to end hosts

let's go on switch one first enable

count T interface F 0 2 remember we have

to set the interface as an access port

first so switch port mode access switch

port port security that's all for switch

1 now let's do the same on switch to

enable con 40 interface F 0 to switch

port mode access switch port port

security now let's go straight into step

2 which is to ping from pc1 to pc2 to

generate traffic between them remember

that no traffic is passing between these

pcs by default so the switches won't

learn the MAC addresses of the PCs until

we send some traffic between them I'll

ping from PC one paying 192.168.1.2 elv

there we go step 3 is to view the secure

MAC addresses on switch 1 I'll go back

to switch 1 and now I'll use the command

show port security address as in the

previous lab

as you can see there is a dynamically

learned secure MAC address on the Fast

Ethernet 0 2 interface which must be PC

ones step four says to check the

configuration of switch ones Fast

Ethernet 0 to interface in the running

configuration show running config here

it is as you can see there are only the

two commands we entered before switch

port mode access and switch port port

security remember this as we will

contrast it with sticky mag address

configuration later step 5 is to save

the running config and reload the switch

I'll use write to save then reload ok

now the switch is reloading step 6 is to

view the secure MAC addresses on switch

1 again do you think PC ones MAC address

will still be saved as a secure MAC

address we saved the running

configuration but PC ones MAC address

wasn't anywhere in the running

configuration so let's check the port

security address table again enable show

port security address as you can see PC

ones MAC address is no longer present

dynamically learned secure MAC addresses

will not be retained when you restart

the switch even if you save the running

configuration because the address isn't

actually entered into the runner

configuration when it is dynamically

learned step 7 is to enable the sticky

secure MAC address feature on switch

ones

f02 interface con 40 interface f0 to now

this feature is enabled with this

command switch port port security MAC

address sticky that's it

now let's ping between the PCs again to

generate traffic

on PC one ping 192.168.1.1 that's all

for step 7 step 8 is to view the secure

MAC addresses of switch 1 then the

running config so on switch 1 show port

security address there is PC ones MAC

address again this time it is listed as

a secure sticky address what's the

difference well let's check the running

configuration show run as you can see in

addition to the three commands we

manually configured on the interface

there is a fourth one which we didn't

configure switch port port security MAC

address sticky followed by PC ones MAC

address this is because we enabled the

sticky feature when this feature is

enabled the switch saves dynamically

learned secure MAC addresses to the

running configuration of the switch step

nine is to save the running

configuration and reload again let's do

that right reload

step 10 is to view the secure MAC

addresses on switch one once again this

time do you expect to see PC ones MAC

address in the table PC ones MAC address

was saved to the running configuration

of switch 1 and we saved the running

configuration before reloading so it

should be in the table even after

restarting let's check enable show port

security address as expected PC ones MAC

address is still saved as a secure MAC

address on the f02 interface so to

review without the sticky feature

enabled dynamically learned secure MAC

addresses are not retained when the

switch is reloaded the sticky MAC

address learning feature however

automatically saves these addresses to

the running configuration and thus will

be retained upon reload if the runner

configuration is saved that's all for
