lab we will take a look at two methods

of inter VLAN routing using two small

networks one is known as router on a

stick which we already covered in the

icnd1 labs but we will do a little

review here the other method is using

SBI's on a multi-layer switch which is a

switch with routing capabilities let's

get started first let's configure switch

1 for inter VLAN routing using s vis

switch 1 isn't connected to a router in

this small network and even if it were

it might be preferable for a switch 1 to

rub between VLANs itself without having

to send the traffic to a router now pc1

& pc2 shouldn't be able to ping each

other at the moment let's try from PC 1

ping 1002 10

doesn't work let's go on switch one and

make it work an able coffee tea ok the

first step is to enable IP routing on

the switch which is done with the

command IP routing this enables the

layer 3 capabilities of this multi-layer

switch next we just have to configure

the VLANs with IP addresses interface

VLAN 10 I configured each PC to use the

dot 1 address of their subnet as a

default gateway

so for VLAN 10 IP address 1001 one

255.255.255.0 also SV eyes are shut down

by default so remember no shutdown now

let's configure VLAN 20 interface VLAN

20 IP address 1002 one 255.255.255.0 no

shutdown that's all there is to it

keep in mind I already configured switch

ones interfaces connected to a PC one

and PC two to be in VLAN 10 and VLAN 20

do show VLAN brief there you go

now let's try our ping once more from PC

one ping 1000 two 1000 all there is to

inter VLAN routing using SBI's for a

quick review enable IP routing on the

multi-layer switch create the

appropriate SV eyes with the interface

VLAN command configure IP addresses on

the SV eyes and enable them with no

shutdown next let's configure inter VLAN

routing in our other small network using

the router on a stick method by using

sub interfaces r2 can act as a default

gateway for multiple subnets using a

single physical interface again I

already configured the switch to

interface

is connected to a PC 3 and PC for to be

in VLAN 30 and VLAN 40 so we just have

to configure the connection between

switch 2 and R 2 let's just show that PC

3 and PC for can't pin each other at the

moment

upping from PC 3 to PC for ping 1004 10

doesn't work

first let's go on switch to enable golf

tee all we have to do here is configure

g0 one as a trunk interface g0 1 switch

port mode trunk

that's all now let's go to our to enable

golf tee let's enable the g00 interface

interface G 0 0 no shutdown now let's

create a sub interface for VLAN 30

interface G 0 0 30 next specify this sub

interface as being before VLAN 30

encapsulation dot1q 30 next we just add

the IP address IP address 1003 1 255 255

255 0 that's all now let's make another

sub interface for VLAN 40 and do the

same interface G 0 0.40 encapsulation

dot1q 40 IP address 1004 1 255.255.255.0

that's all there is to router on a stick

let's try that ping again from pc 3 ping

1004 1

okay there we go

in this slob we looked at two methods of

inter VLAN routing SV eyes and router on

a stick that's all for this lab thank
