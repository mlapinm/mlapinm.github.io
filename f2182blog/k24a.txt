description 15.795921 in this lab we are going to
configure static routing to allow pc1 &
pc2 to communicate with each other
24.299320 static routing as opposed to dynamic
routing involves manually configuring
routes to networks that you want to
reach 32.266722 as a network grows it quickly
becomes unfeasible to manually configure
both primary and backup routes to each
destination network 40.845451 however for small
networks like this example here it is no
problem 45.373223 even in large networks you will
often want to use static routes in
combination with dynamic routing
protocols like ERG RP and OSPF which we
will practice in future labs 57.061157 try to
complete the lab yourself first then
continue watching if you have trouble or
63.041728 watch the video after to check your
solution 66.034348 if you haven't learned the
required commands to complete this lab
yet in your studies feel free to watch
this video to learn them 73.526449 note that no
static routes have been pre-configured
in this lab 77.619929 I have only configured the
default gateways of pc1 & pc2 being the
g0 one interfaces of their respective
routers 85.588898 step one is to configure the G
zero zero and G zero one interfaces of
r1 and r2 according to the network
diagram 96.370854 and enable the interfaces 98.209211 there
are three subnets in this network
101.539471 192.168.1.0 / 24 which includes pc 1
switch 1 and r ones g0 one interface
110.416806 also 10.0.0.0 / 24 which includes the G 0 0
interfaces of r1 and r2 118.965802 also
192.168.20.10 /24
Artoo's G 0 1 interface 128.401893 let's configure
r1 first
131.538455 enable conf t interface g00 IP
address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0 no shut down
146.847428 okay so that's our ones g00 interface
which is connected to our two 153.069223 now let's
do the G zero one interface interface 155.503941 G
0 1 IP address 192.168.1.1
255.255.255.0 no shutdown 166.127653 now let's
configure r 2s interfaces 169.327316 enable conf t interface G 0 0 IP address 10.0.0.2
255.255.255.0 no shutdown 185.217701 interface G 0
1 IP address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0 no
shutdown 195.590304 that's all for step 1
197.425261 step two is to ping from pc1 to our ones
g0 one interface 205.245964 then progressively ping
toward PC two and see which pings
succeed and which fail 210.543976 let's try that
212.740343 first our ones g0 one interface ping
192.168.1.1 it works
225.498901 next our ones G 0 0 interface ping 10.0.0.1
it works too
234.948164 now let's try our two SG 0 0 interface
238.565099 ping 10.0.0.2
this pink fails 249.429052 I won't bother pinging
beyond here those things will fail as
well 253.634072 why is that 255.310926 well for a pin to
succeed
you need to weigh connectivity 260.216557 PC one
needs to be able to reach the
destination and the destination needs to
know how to reach PC one to send the
reply to the ping 268.570853 the first two pings we
send to satisfy both requirements thus
they worked 273.837192 PC one and our ones G zero
one interface are part of the same
network 278.557256 thus they can reach each other
280.518528 PC one isn't part of the same network as
our ones G zero zero interface 285.995634 but it
sends the packet to its default gateway
288.992486 which I pre-configured as our ones G
zero one interface 292.380386 then our one of
course knows the destination because
it's one of its other interfaces 297.901111 it can
then send the ping back to PC one which
is again directly connected to the same
network as its G zero one interface
305.289800 that's why the first two pings worked
307.694434 now why did the third ping fail 311.203748 let's
think about the path the ping takes 314.082751 PC
one sends the ping to its default
317.867565 gateway our ones G zero one interface
320.041834 the destination is 10.0.0.2 which our one
knows the way to because it's part of
the same network as its G zero zero
interface 329.147195 the 10.0.0.0 / 24 network 332.456081 so it
sends the ping out of its G zero zero
interface toward our two 338.267975 now the ping
reaches our two however our two doesn't
know how to send the reply back to PC
one 346.056864 r2 has no route back to the
192.168.1.0 / 24 network 353.544302 because we
haven't configured any reps yet and 356.315147 it's
not a directly connected network 358.594721 so
that's why the ping fails 361.124319 I'll go on are
too quickly to check 363.560034 exit show IP ripped
369.233707 as you can see the 192.168.1.0 network
is not present
378.103293 now let's move on to step three
383.077619 basically we are going to do the same
thing but from PC 2 387.028697 can you guess which
pings will work 389.889384 let's check on PC 2
392.051580 first ping 192.168.2.1 397.086695 r2 is g0 one
interface 398.900305 it works next ping 10.0.0.2 R 2
s G zero zero interface it works also
409.837997 now
ping 10.0.0.1 414.112686 r1s G zero zero
interface 416.257940 it fails this is for the same
reason as before 425.587432 PC 2 sends the ping to
r2 which then sends it to r1 but r1
doesn't have a route back to PC 2 subnet
in its routing table 435.410698 so the ping ends
there
437.320954 step four is to configure static routes
on r1 and r2 to allow PC one to reach PC
two and vice versa
448.602044 we should also make sure we configure
the route to the subnets meaning
192.168.1.0 / 24 and 192.168 2.0 /24 to the
other PC meaning 192.168.1.11 / 32 and
192.168 1 12 / 32 471.901731 in this very small
Network we only have to create one
static route on each router 477.122616 on r1 we
need a route to 192.168.2.0 / 24 485.109118 okay

let's do that on r1 first 494.723567 exit now we
create a static route with the command
IP route 502.753170 now I'll use the question mark
to show what comes next
505.851118 first is the destination prefix in this
case it's 192.168.2.0 513.266181 ? again
514.474509 destination prefix mask 517.282627 it's slash 24 so
that equals 255 255 255 0 523.444446 question mark
one more time 525.809463 now we have a list of
options 528.250252 but really there are just two
530.304308 the option at the top of the list
forwarding routers address means the
next hop address in the route 537.583194 make sure
this is an address the router knows how
to get to 541.201691 if the router can't reach the
next hop address it obviously can't
reach the destination 546.028631 if we choose this
option the next hop address will be r2
SG 0 0 interface 10.0.0.2 554.102057 the other
options are to specify an interface
558.927235 meaning the exit interface we will send
the packets out of on the way to the
destination 563.012428 if we choose this option we
will use gigabit gigabit ethernet 0 0
568.909460 let's go with the first option of the
next hop IP address
573.111302 10.0.0.2 okay
that's it 577.881884 now let's check the routing
table 581.172356 do show IP route 583.795675 here with an S
indicating static we see our route to
the 192.168.2.0 / 24 network
592.324551 to the next hop address 596.493612 since we're
looking at the table anyway
600.118678 notice these other routes have C or L
next to them 603.647085 C refers to a connected
network 607.686280 in this case that 10.0.0.0 / 24
network 612.527726 and 192.168.1.0 24 network 615.861231 l
refers to a local address on the router
itself 621.010114 10.0.0.1 and 192.168.1.1 the IP
addresses of the G 0 0 and G 0 1
interfaces 629.740014 ok now let's configure the
route on r2 635.268797 ip routes 192.168.1.0
255.255.255.0 646.231031 and now let's configure
the exit interface instead of the next
hop address just to try it 651.358922 out G 0 0 653.534294 ok
now we should be able to ping from pc1
to pc2 659.401708 let's go on pc 1 and try it 662.699544 out
ping 192.168.2.11
668.691237 there we go 685.062991 the ping worked that's all
