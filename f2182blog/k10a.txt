welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab you can download the lab

file from the link in the description

in this short lab we will connect to r1

via the console port and configure

usernames and passwords particularly

it's important to know whether usernames

and passwords are case sensitive so

we'll experiment with that in this lab

try to complete the lab on your own

first then continue watching this video

if you have trouble or watch it after to

check your solution

step one is to use PC one to access r1

via the console port PC one is already

connected to our ones console port so

let's click on PC one then click desktop

and terminal accept the default

configurations here and now we're on our

one next is to create two users on our

one CCNA in lowercase letters with the

password Cisco in lowercase letters and

CCNP in lowercase with the password

Cisco in uppercase so let's go to global

config mode and able compte you can

create users with this command username

CCNA password Cisco that's it now let's

create the second user username CCNP

password Cisco with Cisco being an

uppercase this time now if we log out of

the router and then access it again we

still won't be asked to use a username

and password we have to tell the console

port to require a username and password

so let's do that

line console 0 if you remember when we

configured the line password on the

console we use the command login to make

it required to access the console port

this time however we want to instruct

the router to use the local user

database instead that is done with this

command login local so that's step 2 and

step 3

step four is to log out of the router

and log in again with each account we're

going to test whether or not the

usernames and passwords are case

sensitive so I'll type end to return to

privileged exec mode and then log out

let's try the CCNA a user with the

password cisco in lower case as we

configured it works let's log out again

now I'll try the username in all caps

with the password in lower case again as

you can see it lets us log in so the

username is not case-sensitive now let's

check the password I'll use the CCNA

username again doesn't matter if you

type in a lowercase or uppercase but

this time I'll type the password in all

caps although you can't see the

characters as I type it fails I'll try

again in case I hit a wrong key doesn't

work so the password is case-sensitive

let's quickly try again with the CCNP

username again to confirm I'll type the

username alternating upper and lower

case just to prove the point and I'll

type the correct password which is all

uppercase it works

log out again this time I'll type the

password in lowercase doesn't work

so to summarize usernames are not case

sensitive but passwords are case

sensitive

next I'll do one more demonstration even

though this isn't part of the lab let me

login again then enable show run look at

the usernames and passwords here we're

going to add a new user named CCNA with

all capitals if we are correct about

user names not being case sensitive it

should replace the current user rather

than actually creating a new user compte

user named CCNA password router do show

run as you can see it didn't actually

create a new user it still displays the

user name in the lower case even though

I typed in an upper case but the

password is now router instead of Cisco
