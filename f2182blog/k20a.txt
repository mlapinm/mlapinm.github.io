description this lab xx of these free

labs I've created for YouTube will serve

as a review of several of the topics

we've covered in the previous 19 I plan

to do these at various points in this

series although you could just go back

and redo previous labs to serve as

review my regular configuration labs

tend to focus on just one technology at

a time such as VLANs or port security I

think that labs like this one involving

multiple technologies are also

beneficial in this lab we will configure

host names the enable secret VLANs

trunks port security and inter VLAN

routing with router on a stick try to

complete the lab yourself first then

continue watching this video if you have

trouble or watch it after to check your

solution step one is to configure host

names for each of the networking devices

are one switch one and switch to this is

done with a single command host name

let's go on our one first an able compte

host named r1 next switch one enable

compte host name switch one finally

switch to enable coffee/tea host name

switch two that's it for step one

step two is to configure an enable

secret of CCNA for each networking

device this is another fairly simple

step

remember the enable secret is an

encrypted password that protects

privileged exec mode of the router

requiring a password to use the enable

command we could also configure an

enable password and then encrypt it with

the service password encryption command

however the encryption of the enable

secret is more secure so you'll always

want to use that instead

let's do switch to first since we're

here enable secret CCNA remember

passwords are case sensitive so make

sure CCNA is all capitals now let's use

the same command on switch 1 enable

secret CCNA and finally r1 enable secret

CCNA that's all for step 2

step three is to configure the switch

ports to which pcs are connected as

access ports in specific VLANs pc1 & pc2

VLAN 13 & pc2 and pc 4 in VLAN 24 let's

start on switch one PC one is connected

to f0 two so interface f0 to switch port

mode access now that we've explicitly

configured it as an access port let's

put it in VLAN 13 switch port access

VLAN 13 now let's configure f03

which pc 2 is connected to to be in VLAN

24 interface f03 switch port mode access

switch port access VLAN 24 that's it for

switch 1 next let's hop on switch to

interface f0 to switch port mode access

PC 3 is connected to this interface so

switch port access VLAN 13 now f03

which pc 4 is connected to interface f03

switch port mode access switch port

access VLAN 24 that's all for step 3

step four is to configure a trunk

between switch 1 and switch to remember

switch ports by default function as

access ports in VLAN 1 pcs 1 2 3 & 4 are

in VLAN 13 and 24 so even pcs in the

same VLAN won't be able to communicate

with each other across these two

switches currently the two switches will

only carry traffic in VLAN 1 between

them let's configure this trunk to

change that now which interfaces do they

use to connect to each other let's use

one CDP command to find out on switch to

first since we're already here do show

CDP neighbors as it shows here switch 2

is connected to switch 1 using the F 0 1

interface it also shows that switch 2 is

connected to switch ones F 0 1 interface

here so we don't need to use this

command on switch 1 let's configure the

trunk down interface F 0 1 switch port

mode trunk that's it on this switch

model we don't have to configure the

encapsulation type of dot1q if we did we

would use the command switch port trunk

encapsulation dot1q now let's go to

switch 1 to do the same interface F 0 1

switch part mode trunk let's use a show

command to confirm do show interface

trunk as you can see

f 0 1 is indeed trunking now pc 1 should

be able to pin PC 3 but not pc 2 and pc

4 likewise pc 2 should be able to pin pc

4 but not pc 1 in pc 3 let's try on pc 1

first ping 1001 12 the ping to pc -

doesn't work now - pc 3 ping 1000 13

it works let's confirm on PC to ping

1000 11 the ping to PC 1 doesn't work

now let's ping PC for which should work

ping 1001 14 it works our trunk has been

successfully configured

now Step five is to configure port

security on the switch ports connected

to PCs we need to enable sticky MAC

address learning and change the default

violation action of shutdown to restrict

let's go on switch one will be using the

same commands for each interface so

let's be more efficient by configuring

an interface range instead of doing each

one separately interface range f0 2 to 3

now we're in interface range

configuration mode both interfaces are

already explicitly configured as access

ports so we don't have to do that this

time switch port port security

now port security is enabled let's

configure sticky MAC address learning

switch port port security MAC address

sticky finally let's change the

violation action to restrict which

blocks offending traffic but does not

shut down the port that is done with

this command switch port port security

violation restrict now let's do the same

on switch to again I'll configure an

interface range interface range F 0 2 to

3 switch port port security switch port

port security MAC address sticky switch

port port security violation restrict

there we go step 5 is now complete

step six is to configure inter VLAN

routing with the router on a stick

method router on a stick

involves configuring sub interfaces on a

router one for each VLAN required we'll

do that on our ones g00 interface which

is connected to switch ones g0 one

interface we also must configure switch

ones g0 one interface as a trunk so

let's do that first interface g0 one

switch port mode trunk okay that's all

we need to do on switch one let's go to

r1 now interface G zero zero now router

interfaces are shutdown by default as

you may have noticed from the red port

lights on the link between r1 and switch

1 so first I'll type no shutdown to

enable it you could also do this at the

end of the configuration now let's

create the sub interface for VLAN

thirteen interface g0 0.13 note that the

sub interface name doesn't actually have

to match the v/line number but it's good

practice to do so to avoid confusion now

first we have to set the encapsulation

and VLAN encapsulation dot1q thirteen

okay now let's set the IP address

according to our instructions and the

default gateway addresses i've pre

configured on the pcs in this lab let's

set it to IP address 1001 255.255.255.0

okay that's it now let's configure the

sub interface for VLAN 24 interface g0

0.24 encapsulation dot1q 24 IP address

1001 one 255.255.255.0 our inter VLAN

routing is now complete

finally let's ping between pcs to make

sure everything works we should now have

full connectivity between all pcs to

check I'll ping from PC 1 and then from

PC 2 on PC 1 let's ping PC 2 first ping

1001 12 it works next PC 3 ping 1000 13

it works

finally PC for ping 1001 dot 14 it works

as well now let's do the same on PC to

first stop in PC 1 ping 1000 11 it works

PC 3-pin 1000 13 it works too

finally I'll ping PC for ping 1001 14 it

works as well

we have full connectivity between all

computers that's all for this lab
