description 15.390226this lab xx of these free

labs I've created for YouTube will serve

as a review of several of the topics

we've covered in the previous 19 24.832042I plan

to do these at various points in this

series 29.30156although you could just go back

and redo previous labs to serve as

review 34.699568my regular configuration labs

tend to focus on just one technology at

a time such as VLANs or port security 41.114527I

think that labs like this one involving

multiple technologies are also

beneficial 46.998558in this lab we will configure

host names the enable secret VLANs

trunks port security and inter VLAN

routing with router on a stick 58.427102try to

complete the lab yourself first 61.309243then

continue watching this video if you have

trouble or watch it after to check your

solution 66.58394step one is to configure host

names for each of the networking devices
72.395519
r one switch one and switch 2 75.877368this is

done with a single command 78.577624host name
79.792302
let's go on r one first 82.288748 enable conf t

host named r1 88.501488next switch one 90.893059enable

conf t host name switch one 95.925156finally

switch 2 98.266837 enable conf t host name

switch two 103.825952that's it for step one
105.738412
step two is to configure an enable

secret of CCNA for each networking

device 114.616132this is another fairly simple

step
117.335663
remember the enable secret is an

encrypted password that protects

privileged exec mode of the router
123.827327
requiring a password to use the enable

command 127.138543we could also configure an

enable password and then encrypt it with

the service password encryption command
133.571733
however the encryption of the enable

secret is more secure 137.574847so you'll always

want to use that instead
139.85111
let's do switch to first since we're

here 143.213483enable secret CCNA 146.374858remember

passwords are case sensitive so make

sure CCNA is all capitals 151.322811now let's use

the same command on switch 1 155.070335enable

secret CCNA 158.386667and finally r1 enable secret

CCNA 164.91777that's all for step 2
166.783774
step three is to configure the switch

ports to which pcs are connected as

access ports in specific VLANs 176.492922pc1 & pc2

VLAN 13 & pc2 and pc 4 in VLAN 24 183.09766let's

start on switch one 185.59947PC one is connected

to f0 two so interface f0 2 192.630888switch port

mode access 194.660238now that we've explicitly

configured it as an access port let's

put it in VLAN 13 200.195033switch port access

VLAN 13 203.144313now let's configure f03

which pc 2 is connected to to be in VLAN

24 209.133615interface f03 switch port mode access

switch port access VLAN 24 217.094483that's it for

switch 1 next let's hop on switch 2
221.777834
interface f0 2 switch port mode access
226.813212
PC 3 is connected to this interface so

switch port access VLAN 13 233.221732now f03

which pc 4 is connected too 237.514995interface f03

switch port mode access switch port

access VLAN 24 245.245238that's all for step 3
249.159886
step four is to configure a trunk

between switch 1 and switch 2 255.774305remember

switch ports by default function as

access ports in VLAN 1 261.376121pcs 1 2 3 & 4 are

in VLAN 13 and 24 266.862756so even pcs in the

same VLAN won't be able to communicate

with each other across these two

switches 272.730842currently the two switches will

only carry traffic in VLAN 1 between

them 278.482151let's configure this trunk to

change that 281.711431now which interfaces do they

use to connect to each other 285.945086let's use

one CDP command to find out 288.663991on switch 2

first since we're already here 293.136909do show

CDP neighbors 296.663197as it shows here switch 2

is connected to switch 1 using the F 0 1

interface 303.017659it also shows that switch 2 is

connected to switch ones F 0 1 interface

here 308.819796so we don't need to use this

command on switch 1 311.882595let's configure the

trunk down 314.822903interface F 0 1 switch port

mode trunk 319.690695that's it on this switch

model we don't have to configure the

encapsulation type of dot1q 325.867183if we did we

would use the command switch port trunk

encapsulation dot1q 333.830376now let's go to

switch 1 to do the same 337.062025interface F 0 1

switch part mode trunk 342.986842let's use a show

command to confirm 346.40453do show interface

trunk 349.945845as you can see

f 0 1 is indeed trunking 353.730241now pc 1 should

be able to pin PC 3 357.648823but not pc 2 and pc

4 360.276045likewise pc 2 should be able to pin pc

4 but not pc 1 in pc 3 366.742355let's try on pc 1

first 369.523253ping 10.0.1.12 the ping to pc 2

doesn't work 376.173696now to pc 3 ping 10.0.0.13
381.429038
it works 384.025984let's confirm on PC 2 387.321826ping

10.0.0.11 390.756389the ping to PC 1 doesn't work
395.144521
now let's ping PC 4 which should work
397.975496
ping 10.0.1.14 it works 405.461493our trunk has been

successfully configured
408.034864
now Step five is to configure port

security on the switch ports connected

to PCs 416.515786we need to enable sticky MAC

address learning and change the default

violation action of shutdown to restrict
423.845611
let's go on switch one 426.832016will be using the

same commands for each interface 429.683164so

let's be more efficient by configuring

an interface range instead of doing each

one separately 436.031805interface range f0 2 to 3
440.827983
now we're in interface range

configuration mode 444.336898both interfaces are

already explicitly configured as access

ports 448.962244so we don't have to do that this

time 450.67712switch port port security
453.907902
now port security is enabled 456.35315let's

configure sticky MAC address learning
458.88629
switch port port security MAC address

sticky 462.401569finally let's change the

violation action to restrict 466.524584which

blocks offending traffic but does not

shut down the port 470.065533that is done with

this command 472.388084switch port port security

violation restrict 477.385688now let's do the same

on switch 2 480.128705again I'll configure an

interface range 483.593192interface range F 0 2 to

3 488.191279switch port port security switch port

port security MAC address sticky 494.642262switch

port port security violation restrict
498.383218
there we go step 5 is now complete
502.305852
step six is to configure inter VLAN

routing with the router on a stick

method 510.707798router on a stick

involves configuring sub interfaces on a

router 






515.274418

one for each VLAN required we'll

do that on our ones g00 interface which

is connected to switch ones g0 one

interface we also must configure switch

ones g0 one interface as a trunk so

let's do that first interface g0 one

switch port mode trunk okay that's all

we need to do on switch one let's go to

r1 now interface G zero zero now router

interfaces are shutdown by default as

you may have noticed from the red port

lights on the link between r1 and switch

1 so first I'll type no shutdown to

enable it you could also do this at the

end of the configuration now let's

create the sub interface for VLAN

thirteen interface g0 0.13 note that the

sub interface name doesn't actually have

to match the v/line number but it's good

practice to do so to avoid confusion now

first we have to set the encapsulation

and VLAN encapsulation dot1q thirteen

okay now let's set the IP address

according to our instructions and the

default gateway addresses i've pre

configured on the pcs in this lab let's

set it to IP address 10.0.1. 255.255.255.0

okay that's it now let's configure the

sub interface for VLAN 24 interface g0

0.24 encapsulation dot1q 24 IP address

10.0.1. 255.255.255.0 our inter VLAN

routing is now complete

finally let's ping between pcs to make

sure everything works we should now have

full connectivity between all pcs to

check I'll ping from PC 1 and then from

PC 2 on PC 1 let's ping PC 2 first ping

10.0.1.12 it works next PC 3 ping 10.0.1.13

it works

finally PC for ping 10.0.1.14 it works

as well now let's do the same on PC to

first stop in PC 1 ping 10.0.1.11 it works

PC 3-pin 10.0.1.13 it works too

finally I'll ping PC for ping 10.0.1.14 it

works as well

we have full connectivity between all

computers that's all for this lab
