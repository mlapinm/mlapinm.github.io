welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab you can download the lab

file from the link in the description in

this lab we will review the creation of

a local user database on the router and

introduced the banner function this will

be a fairly short lab but try to

complete it on your own first and then

continue watching this video if you have

trouble or watch it after to check your

solution step one is to use PC one to

connect to r1 via the console port

they're already connected by a cable so

let's click on PC one desktop terminal

and press ok to accept the default

configurations step two is to create two

users on our one last time we created

user accounts with passwords this time

we will use secrets same as with the

enable password and an able secret

passwords are not encrypted but secrets

are encrypted by default an able conf t

username CCNA secret Cisco with a

capital C remember that user name isn't

case sensitive but the password or

secret is next user username CCNP secret

Cisco I'll quickly type do show run to

check that their encrypted as you can

see they are encrypted by default step 3

is to set the console port to use the

local database to authenticate users

line console 0 login local that's it

step four is to set a message of the day

banner of welcome to packet racer and a

login banner of authorized users only

banners are messages that display before

or after users log in in this case the

message of the day banner will be

displayed above the login banner and

both will be displayed before our user

logs in so exit to make the banner of

the day we use this command banner motd

then I'll use the question mark to show

the next option as you can see we need

to enter a delimited character to

indicate the start and end of the

message if you type the message directly

it will think that the first character

is the delimiting character and it will

be excluded from the message itself you

can use whatever you want but I'll use

an asterisk asterisk

welcome to packet tracer asterisk okay

now the same process for the log in

banner banner login asterisk authorized

users only asterisk now we've set up the

two banners finally let's log out and

see if our messages work and logout

there we go

before we log in you can see our message

of the day and then our log in banner
