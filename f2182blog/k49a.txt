description also please subscribe to the

channel for more labs like this this lab

will be a little different than other

labs there will be no configurations

although we will use show commands later

to confirm our answers using the

information on the lab topology here we

must answer these questions in this

topology of 4 switches we must identify

the root bridge and then which ports are

route ports designated ports and

alternate or blocked ports across all

these switches this should test your

knowledge of STP and how STP elections

actually work there could very well be

questions similar to this on the test as

well so make sure you can solve problems

like this let's get started which switch

is the root bridge the switch with the

lowest bridge ID will become the root

bridge remember the bridge ID consists

of the priority and the MAC address of

the switch so the switch with the lowest

priority will become the root or if

there is a tie the switch with the

lowest MAC address well all four

switches have the same priority of 3 to

769 so let's compare the MAC addresses

by looking at the first four characters

of each mac we can rule out - switch -

and switch 4 neither of them has the

lowest MAC address switch 1 and switch

two have the same first 4 characters but

if you look at the next 4 you can tell

that switch 1 has the lowest Mac so let

me type in the answer which switch is

the root bridge switch 1 now on the root

bridge all ports are designated ports so

I'll type those in as well

designated ports switch 1 F 0 1 F 2 0 2

okay now let's continue

each of the other three switches will

set their interface with the lowest cost

to the root as a report on switch to

that's obviously f02 and on switch three

that's F 0 1 let me write those down now

on switch for which port is it well F 0

1 is a fast ethernet interface so the

spanning tree cost will be 19 to switch

to plus 19 to switch 1 so 38 G 0 1 is a

Gigabit Ethernet interface so the cost

will be 4 to switch 3 plus 19 to switch

1 so 23 therefore G 0 1 will be the

route port on switch for now the

interface across from a root port has to

be designated so a switch 3 SG 0 on

interface will be designated also now

the question is which port is blocked

switch to sf0 one interface or switch 4

Zepp 0 one interface to determine this

we first compare the route cost the

total cost to the root bridge switch 2

has a lower cost to the root bridge so

it's f0 one interface will be designated

and switch 4 is f0 one interface will be

blocked

ok let's check our answers with some

show commands I'll go on switch one

first enable show spanning tree this

bridge is the root and F 0 1 and F 0 2

are indeed designated ports next let's

go on switch to enable show spanning

tree F 0 1 is designated and F 0 2 is

the root port great now let's check on

switch 3 enable show spanning tree F 0 1

is the report and G 0 1 is designated

finally let's check on switch for enable

show spanning tree F 0 1 is alternate

meaning it is blocked and G 0 1 is the

root port ok our answers are correct

this has been a fairly short lab but

hopefully you're able to improve your

understanding of spanning tree protocol

that's all for this lab thank you for
