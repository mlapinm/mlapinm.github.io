lab we will once again configure a IG RP

this time in a network that uses ipv6

configuring a IG RP for ipv6 is very

similar to configuring OSPF v3 for ipv6

rather than using the network command in

Eid RP configuration mode you can figure

it directly on the interfaces aside from

that there isn't much different between

configuring a EIGRP for ipv6 and for

ipv4 let's get started the first step is

to configure loopback interfaces on each

router these will become the EIG RP

router IDs like OSPF v3 for ipv6 ERG RP

for ipv6 uses a 32-bit router ID in the

form of an ipv4 address although it

doesn't have to actually be an address

on the device you can manually configure

the ID however if you don't the highest

ipv4 address on a loopback interface

will become the router ID if there is no

loopback interface the highest ipv4

address on a regular interface will

become the router ID I think I've

configured enough loopback interfaces

for these videos by now so just for this

video I've already configured that

loopback interfaces on are two three

four and five let's just quickly do it

on our one enable compte interface l0 IP

address 1.1 1.1 255.255.255.0 5 ok

that's all next is to configure a IG RP

on this network let's start here on r1

to configure a IG RP for ipv6 just put

ipv6 in front of the usual command

ipv6 router EAG RP and once again we'll

use the a s number 100 now as I

mentioned before we don't actually

activate ERG RP on the interfaces from

here however one of the requirements for

the lab is to make our ones

g02 interface passive previously we use

this command to suppress advertisements

on loopback interfaces because there's

no point in sending advertisements on

interfaces leading to nowhere in this

case however we want to advertise the

network on the g02 interface into EIGRP

but want to suppress advertisements on

the interface because of possible

security risks of sending AI GRP

advertisements out towards the internet

the command is the same as with ipv4

passive interface g02

okay now let's activate a IG r p on the

interfaces interface g00 ipv6 zi g RP

followed by the a.s number 100 that's

all there is to it interface G 0 1 IP v6

z IG RP 100 interface G 0 to ipv6 AI g

RP 100 ok we've activated AI g RP on all

of our ones interfaces do show run

here's the EIG RP configuration but

what's this shut down yes ERG RP for

ipv6 has a shutdown feature I think that

whether the process is shut down by

defaults depends on either the OS

version or the router model in this case

it's shut down by default so let's go

back to a IG RP configuration mode and

activate it ipv6 router ew g RP 100 no

shutdown now I'll go through and do the

same thing on the other routers are to

next enable coffee tea

now we don't actually have to create the

EIG RP process here we can go directly

to the interface and if we activate AIG

our pas 100 on that interface the router

will create the eigrp process for us

interface g00 ipv6 AIG RP 100 interface

G 0 1 IP v6 AIG RP 100 ok so that

activates AI gr p on the interfaces and

creates the EIGRP process however we

haven't gotten any messages about an

adjacency with our one yet why is that

once again the shut down feature to be

honest from my CCNA and CCNP studies I

don't remember having to enable AIG RP

for ipv6 with no shutdown but it seems

some routers require that by default so

for the test and real world situations

just be aware that EA GRP for ipv6 has a

shutdown feature ipv6 router AIG RP 100

no shutdown next let's go to our 3

enable compte ipv6 router AIG RP 100 no

shutdown interface G 0 0 ipv6 AIG RP 100

interface G 0 1 IP v6 g IG RP 100

interface g 0 to ipv6 ERG RP 100 ok

let's go on our 4 enable compte ipv6

router AIG RP 100 no shutdown interface

g 0 0 ipv6 AIG RP 100 interface g 0 1 IP

v6 e IG RP 100 finally r 5 enable compte

ipv6 router AIG RP 100 interface g 0 0

ipv6 AIG RP 100 ok we've configured ew g

RP on all of the routers let's go back

on R 1 and see if we have all of the

roads do show ipv6 route looks like

we've got the 23 34 and 35 networks we

want next we have to advertise a default

route to the internet from R 1 now ew g

RP doesn't have the default information

originated command that OSPF has so how

can we go about this well we can

advertise the default route as a summary

route on the g 0 0 & g 0 1 interfaces

let's try on our one interface g 0 0 the

command is the same as for ipv4 just use

ipv6 at the beginning instead of IP ipv6

summary address ew g RP 100 and remember

the default route for ipv6 is colon

colon slash 0 now let's go on g 0 1 and

do the same interface g 0 1 IP v6

summary address key ID RP 100 colon

colon slash 0 let's go check on one of

the routers i'll check on our v because

if our v has the route r2 r3 and r4 a

must as well do show ipv6 red there it

is right at the top ok in this slab we

configured AI GRP for ipv6 the

configuration is similar to EIGRP for

ipv4 however remember you must configure

it at the interface level that's all for
