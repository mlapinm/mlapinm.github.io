studying for the CCNA in this lab we

will configure BGP the border gateway

protocol

unlike rip AIG RP and OSPF which are

iGPS or interior gateway protocols BGP

is an eg P an exterior gateway protocol

while I GPS are used for routing within

an organization eg PS are used for

routing between organizations and these

days BGP is really the only EGP in use

the extent to which you have to know BGP

is fairly limited for the CCNA you can

go deeper into BGP by continuing to the

ccnp or by looking at the service

provider track of certifications for the

CCNA routing and switching you have to

be able to configure external bgp or

ebgp for single home to branch

connectivity single home means a single

connection to a single internet service

provider as is the case here in this

network our organization is using BGP

autonomous system number 65,000 and is

connected to an Internet service

provider in a s60 5001 we will create a

bgp peering between r1 and SPR 1 so r1

will learn various desired routes from

SP r1 and r1 will advertise our internal

networks out to the service provider in

this case we will test by pinging to an

external server at 1500 won let's get

started first I'll go on r2

enable show IP route as you can see r2

has already learned various routes from

OSPF which is used within the

organization and has learned a default

route to the internet from r1 which use

the default information originated

command in OSPF however a ping to the

external server

15:01 won't work let's try ping 1500 dot

1 as expected the ping fails this is

because we haven't advertised our

internal networks to the service

provider so the pings have no return

path so let's go on r1 and configure BGP

enable con 47 mode type router bgp

followed by the a s or autonomous system

number in this case 65,000 a s numbers

are very important for BGP so make sure

you type them correctly now unlike OSPF

and EIGRP which dynamically discover

neighbors by being activated on

interfaces and sending multicast

messages in BGP we must manually specify

each neighbor and a TCP connection is

then made to form the peering you can do

that with this command neighbor 101 that

being the IP address of SP r1 the

service provider router and that next

remote - a s followed by the a s number

of the neighbor 65,000 won in this case

again a s numbers are very important for

BGP so make sure you enter your own a s

number correctly when entering BGP mode

and make sure you type the neighbors a s

number correctly when using the neighbor

command next let's move on to

advertising networks to review the

Network statement used in a EIGRP and

OSPF

the network command doesn't actually

specify which networks to advertise it

specifies which interfaces to activate

the protocol on and then those

interfaces networks are advertised so

when using the network command you don't

have to enter the exact network prefix

and mask however BGP is different in BGP

you have to enter the exact network and

mask and a matching route must be in

your routing table for example our one

has a loopback of 1.1.1 1/32 if I enter

100 with a / 8 mask in the network

command it won't work I have to enter

the exact 1.1.11

/ 32 network to advertise it so let's

advertise the loop Beck's do show IP

route as you can see I have rights to

1.1.11 / 32 - 2 - 2 / 32 and 3.33 3/32

so I can advertise them in BGP the BGP

Network command goes like this

Network 1.1.11 mask 255.255.255.0 5 you

have to type mask in the command and

also it's not a wildcard mask like in

Eid RP and OSPF it's a standard Network

mask okay let's do the others Network -

- - - mask 255.255.255.0 5 Network 3 3 3

3 mask 255.255.255.0 5 ok the next step

is to advertise a summary of the Tendo

12/30 10.23 o / 30 and 10.30 know / 30

networks with a single Network command

using a slash 16 mask now this is a

problem I said before there has to be a

match in the route table to advertise

something in BGP

do show IP route there is no 1000 2/16

network in the routing table here I'll

do the network command network 10000

mask 255.255.255.0

it still doesn't work because r1 is in

advertising that 1000 / 16 Network yet

because it doesn't have the route in its

route table so let's go back to our 1

and make a route exit IP route 10000 255

255 0 0 now what should we enter next

the answer is null 0 the null 0

interface essentially discards anything

that is sent to it why would we want to

use that well we wanted to create the

route to advertise it in BGP do show IP

route there's the 10000 / 16 route and

here are our more specific routes any

traffic that comes for the Tendo 12/30

10.30 no / 30 or 10.23 o / 30 networks

will be sent out their appropriate

interfaces because these have a more

specific meaning a longer network mask /

30 vs / 16 however if something comes

for the 1001 o / 24 Network for example

it won't match any of those and will

instead be sent to the null 0 interface

and discarded this is good because the

10.10 / 24 network isn't present in our

internal network so there's no point in

sending a packet destined for that

network any further than our one the use

of that null 0 interface can be a little

difficult to understand feel free to ask

questions if you're not sure about it

this use of a null interface is often

called a discard route by the way anyway

now the 10000 / 60 network is present in

our Rev table so that means r1 will be

advertising it to the service provider

so if we send a ping to the remote

server from r2 the ping reply should be

able to find its way back now let's try

on r2 ping 1500 won

there we go the ping works this time so

in this lab we configured an external

bgp neighbor advertised our internal

networks and looked at the idea of a

discard route that's all for this lab
