welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab you can download the lab

file from the link in the description if

you like these labs please consider

supporting me via my patreon or the

cryptocurrency options in the

description this lab uses the same

topology as the previous lab number 20

whereas lab 20 had you configured

various technologies this lab requires

you to troubleshoot several

configuration errors to restore

connectivity between pcs 1 2 3 & 4

troubleshooting is a valuable skill and

also good practice for the exam as you

will most likely encounter some sort of

troubleshooting lab in your exam in this

video I won't go through the exact

troubleshooting method I would use to

fix the topology there is somewhat of an

art to troubleshooting and you can go

about it in many ways instead I will

just show you the configuration errors

one by one however it is important to

have some sort of system to troubleshoot

try to complete the lab yourself first

then continue watching this video if you

can't find and fix all of the

configuration errors or watch it after

to check your solution first let's try

to ping from pc1 and see if it can reach

the other pcs paint no.1 dot 12 can't

reach PC 2 ping 1000 13 can't reach PC 3

and paint no.1 14 can't reach PC 4 so PC

1 can't reach any of the other pcs there

are multiple miss configurations in this

lab and they all contribute to that but

let's look at one of them I'll go on

switch one password out of CCNA enable

if you use the command shell port

security

notice that the security violation count

is not zero this is because our pings

have been triggering port security

violations

so run look here under f02 sticky MAC

address learning is supposed to be

configured but instead a secure MAC

address of áááá áááá áááá is configured

let's fix that con 14 interface f0 - no

switch port port security MAC address

eh-eh-eh-eh eh-eh-eh-eh eh-eh-eh-eh ok

that remove the configuration now lets

enable sticky mac learning switch port

port security MAC address sticky ok now

let's try to ping from pc1 again just a

PC to ping 1001 dot 12 it doesn't work

but let's go back to switch 1 again do

show port security notice that the

security violation counter hasn't

increased so PC one isn't triggering

anymore port security violations but

there are still problems elsewhere

next let's check our inter VLAN routing

since PC one can't pin PC to let's go on

our one password of CCNA enable show run

look at the two sub interfaces of G zero

zero there is one miss configuration on

each on the g0 0.13 sub-interface the IP

address is incorrect it should be 10.1

which is the default gateway set on the

pcs in VLAN 13 not 10.2 also the v/line

of the g0 0.24 sub interface is

incorrect it should be 24 not - lets fix

those errors con 40 interface G 0 0 13

IP address 1001 255.255.255.0 note that

you don't have to remove the previous IP

address first this overrides it next

interface G 0 0 24 encapsulation dot1q

24 ok that should fix it now PC one

should be able to paint PC 2 there are

still problems on switch 2 which will

prevent it from reaching PC 3 and PC for

however because pc1 & pc2 are connected

to the same switch and we fixed the

inter VLAN routing they should be able

to reach each other I'll go on PC one to

try paying 1000 1.12 there we go just to

confirm

let's try pc3 to ping 1000 13 doesn't

work

now let's go on switch to password of

CCNA enable let's check if the trunk

between switch 1 and switch 2 is working

show interfaces trunk nothing appears

that's a problem we could use show run

to check but let's try another command

just to get familiar with the various

show commands available show interfaces

f01 switch port take a look at all the

info here and familiarize yourself with

it for this lab what we want to look at

is here the administrative and

operational mode is static access

meaning it has be configured as an

access port not a trunk let's fix that

conf T interface f01 switch port mode

trunk okay that solves that however one

more problem remains on switch to do

show VLAN brief look here f03 is in VLAN

24 as it should be however the f02

interface is in VLAN 23 which is not

correct it should be in VLAN 13 let's

fix that interface f0 to switch port

access VLAN 13 okay that's all the

misconfigurations

that should restore full connectivity

between the four pcs it can take some

time for a spanning tree to reconverge

so things might not work immediately if

you haven't studied spanning 4 yet don't

worry about it yet but after changes the

configuration like we just did it can

take some time for the switches to

communicate the changes to each other

and for those changes to take effect

across the network hopefully enough time

has passed so let's go on pc-12 tests

I'll ping PC 2 first although we already

tested before and it worked

ping 1001 12

the ping works again next let's ping pc3

which didn't work previously because of

the misconfigurations on switch to ping

1000 13 now the ping works and finally

I'll ping PC for pin 1001 14 it works as

well this lab is now complete
