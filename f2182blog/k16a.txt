welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab 5.480994you can download the lab

file from the link in the description 8.454609in

this lab we will configure loopback

interfaces on two routers r1 and r2
16.736868
loopback interfaces are logical

interfaces 21.021283meaning that they are not

interfaces that physically exist on the

router 25.486237they can be used for testing

purposes among others 29.353279another important

characteristic is that a loopback

interface never goes down unlike a

physical interface which can fail
37.153608
loopback interfaces are something we'll

be using a lot in future labs 42.241351so I want

to use this simple lab to introduce them
45.566424
try to complete the lab on your own

first 48.590203then continue watching this video

if you have trouble or watch it after to

check your solution
54.434513
step one is to set the IP addresses of

the interfaces connecting the two

routers and to enable them 65.914952let's hop on

r1 first 68.821056enable conf t both routers

are connected using their gig 0 0

interfaces 78.500477so interface gig 0 0 82.320225now

let's set the IP address 85.547967IP address

192.168.1.1 89.825134with the subnet mask of

255.255.255.0 95.188923ok now we have to enable

the interface 98.369577no shutdown 100.217359there we go

our one is done 102.460883now let's go to r2
104.368105
enable conf t interface g00 IP address

192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 120.277656no shut ok let's

ping to check 125.013648do ping 192.168.1.1 the

ping works 134.011035step 2 is to create a

loopback interface on each router 1.1.1.1

 & 2.2.2.2 145.198528they should

each use a / 32 subnet mask 149.524752which is

equivalent to 255 255 255 255 155.119661ok

let's go on r1 to create a loopback

interface just enter interface

configuration mode for the loopback

interface 165.474578interface loopback 0 168.678192note that

you can shorten it to interface l0 172.568854so

we have now created the loopback

interface 175.992272the loopback interface is up

by default and will never go down
180.488595
however you can still issue the shutdown

command to administrative lead issei

belit 185.366319now let's set the IP address 188.799318IP

address 1.1 1.1

255 255 255 255 196.28518ok now let's go on r2 
198.790761interface l0 IP address 2 2 2 2 255

255 255 255 210.886671we have successfully created

a loopback interface on each device
215.366654
step three is to ping both the local

loopback interface and the loopback

interface of the remote device from each

router 225.88773the router should be able to ping

its own loopback interface with no

issues by default 231.290868however it has no way

of knowing about the loopback interface

of the remote router by default 236.363551the

routers can pin each other's physical

interfaces because they are part of a

connected network which they share
243.846666
however the loopback interfaces are on

separate networks 247.661056because we haven't

done any labs for IP ropes yet I

pre-configured static routes on each

router beforehand 254.864724this isn't a topic for

this lab but let me show you the IP

route table 260.733203let me hop on r1 263.337018and show IP

route 267.95312you see here the C indicating

connected of the 192.168.1.0 Network 276.116495and

the l indicating local of the

192.168.1.1 address configured on the

gig 0/0 interface 283.292259above that is an S

indicating static 287.648635this is the route I

pre-configured to the loopback of r2
291.874642
also at the top is the loopback here on

r1 296.107289now let's try the pings which both

should be successful 300.727298first the local

loopback 303.94082ping 1.1.1.1

it works 310.722019now our twos ping 2.2.2.2 315.089141it

works as well 317.140025now let's do the same on

r2 320.332206end

ping 2.2.2.2 it works 328.234023ping 1.1.1.1 it

works as well
335.025811
step four is to remove the loopback

interfaces 342.98689this is just to point out a

difference between physical interfaces

and loopback interfaces 348.310591you can't delete

a physical interface using the command

line 352.686503let's confirm that 354.160709first on our two

conf T no interface G zero zero 361.269642we get

the message

removal of physical interfaces is not

permitted 366.150851now let's do the same thing ad

no in front of the interface command for

loopback zero 372.220037first however let's use

the do show IP interface brief command
377.316643
there is gig zero zero which we were

unable to delete before and loopback

zero 384.724192now let's try to delete it 386.868471no

interface l0 390.283007do show IP interface brief
393.495554
as you can see we are able to delete

loopback interfaces and loop X zero is

no longer listed here 400.971342let's do the same

on r1 403.806206show IP interface brief there's

loopback zero 409.602943conf t no interface l0 414.459122do

show IP interface brief 417.7599we have

successfully removed the loopback

interface of each router 422.086975that's all for

this lab
