file from the link in the description in

this lab we will configure loopback

interfaces on two routers r1 and r2

loopback interfaces are logical

interfaces meaning that they are not

interfaces that physically exist on the

router they can be used for testing

purposes among others another important

characteristic is that a loopback

interface never goes down unlike a

physical interface which can fail

loopback interfaces are something we'll

be using a lot in future labs so I want

to use this simple lab to introduce them

try to complete the lab on your own

first then continue watching this video

if you have trouble or watch it after to

check your solution

step one is to set the IP addresses of

the interfaces connecting the two

routers and to enable them let's hop on

our one first enable compte both routers

are connected using their gig 0 0

interfaces so interface gig 0 0 now

let's set the IP address IP address

192.168.1.1 with the subnet mask of

255.255.255.0 ok now we have to enable

the interface no shutdown there we go

our one is done now let's go to our to

enable compte interface g00 IP address

192.168.1.1 55.2 55.0 no shut ok let's

ping to check do ping 192.168.1.1 the

ping works step 2 is to create a

loopback interface on each router 1.1.11

on our 1 & 2 - 2 - on our 2 they should

each use a / 32 subnet mask which is

equivalent to 255 dot 255 255 255 ok

let's go on our one to create a loopback

interface just enter interface

configuration mode for the loopback

interface interface loopback 0 note that

you can shorten it to interface l 0 so

we have now created the loopback

interface the loopback interface is up

by default and will never go down

however you can still issue the shutdown

command to administrative lead issei

belit now let's set the IP address IP

address 1.1 1.1

255 255 255 255 ok now let's go on our

to interface l0 IP address 2 2 2 2 255

255 255 255 we have successfully created

a loopback interface on each device

step three is to ping both the local

loopback interface and the loopback

interface of the remote device from each

router the router should be able to ping

its own loopback interface with no

issues by default however it has no way

of knowing about the loopback interface

of the remote router by default the

routers can pin each other's physical

interfaces because they are part of a

connected network which they share

however the loopback interfaces are on

separate networks because we haven't

done any labs for IP ropes yet I

pre-configured static routes on each

router beforehand this isn't a topic for

this lab but let me show you the IP

route table let me hop on r1 and show IP

route you see here the C indicating

connected of the 192.168.1.0 Network and

the l indicating local of the

192.168.1.1 address configured on the

gig 0/0 interface above that is an S

indicating static this is the route I

pre-configured to the loopback of r2

also at the top is the loopback here on

r1 now let's try the pings which both

should be successful first the local

loopback ping 1.1.11

it works now our twos ping - - - - it

works as well now let's do the same on

our two end

ping - two - - it works ping 1.1.11 it

works as well

step four is to remove the loopback

interfaces this is just to point out a

difference between physical interfaces

and loopback interfaces you can't delete

a physical interface using the command

line let's confirm that first on our two

conf T no interface G zero zero we get

the message

removal of physical interfaces is not

permitted now let's do the same thing ad

no in front of the interface command for

loopback zero first however let's use

the do show IP interface brief command

there is gig zero zero which we were

unable to delete before and loopback

zero now let's try to delete it no

interface l0 do show IP interface brief

as you can see we are able to delete

loopback interfaces and loop X zero is

no longer listed here let's do the same

on r1 show IP interface brief there's

loopback zero compte no interface l0 do

show IP interface brief we have

successfully removed the loopback

interface of each router that's all for

this lab
