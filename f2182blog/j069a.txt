00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,440
get all of the lab files for this course, so&nbsp;
you can try it out yourself in packet tracer.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,320
If you want more labs like these, I highly&nbsp;
recommend picking up Boson’s NetSim for the CCNA,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,640
click the link in the video&nbsp;
description to check it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,320
It’s a network simulator like packet tracer, but&nbsp;
it’s even better, and it includes all of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,120
guided labs to not only help you get hands-on&nbsp;
practice configuring and troubleshooting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,640
but also deepen your understanding of the exam&nbsp;
topics. I used it myself when studying for my&nbsp;&nbsp;

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,560
certifications, so I feel confident&nbsp;
about recommending it to all of you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,680
If you want to get your own copy of NetSim,&nbsp;
please follow the link in the video description.

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,840
In this lab we will use CDP to map out a network&nbsp;
topology, and then disable CDP and switch the&nbsp;&nbsp;

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,400
network to LLDP. As you can see, there are&nbsp;
currently no IP address or interface labels&nbsp;&nbsp;

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,480
in this network. In this lab you will use CDP show&nbsp;
commands, and some other commands, to map out this&nbsp;&nbsp;

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,320
network. For the purpose of this video, I have&nbsp;
pre-made all of the labels, just to make the video&nbsp;&nbsp;

17
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,520
go more smoothly. But in the lab file I’m sharing&nbsp;
with you, you’ll have to make the labels yourself.

18
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,960
There are 4 steps, but they can be divided&nbsp;
into two parts. Steps 1 and 2 involve some&nbsp;&nbsp;

19
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:46,080
CDP configurations and using CDP to map out the&nbsp;
network. Then, in steps 3 and 4 we will disable&nbsp;&nbsp;

20
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:54,160
CDP and enable LLDP instead. These network&nbsp;
devices are all Cisco devices, so CDP is fine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

21
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,680
but perhaps we are switching over to LLDP to&nbsp;
prepare for adding devices from another vendor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

22
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,600
I was planning to have you configure the&nbsp;
CDP and LLDP timers in this lab, too,&nbsp;&nbsp;

23
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,720
but actually those configurations&nbsp;
aren’t supported in packet tracer!&nbsp;&nbsp;

24
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:17,280
Still, remember those commands, CDP TIMER,&nbsp;
CDP HOLDTIME, LLDP TIMER, LLDP HOLDTIME,&nbsp;&nbsp;

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,360
and LLDP REINIT. Okay, now I’ll do&nbsp;
steps 1 and 2 on each device first.

26
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,840
I’ll start on PC1. Although this PC can’t use CDP,&nbsp;&nbsp;

27
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,840
we need to add its IP address to this network&nbsp;
diagram. So, I’ll go to the CLI of PC1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

28
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,440
Then I’ll use the command IPCONFIG, and now&nbsp;
we get a few pieces of information. PC1’s IP&nbsp;&nbsp;

29
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:53,200
address is 192.168.1.1, and the subnet mask is&nbsp;
/24, so that means this LAN is 192.168.1.0/24.&nbsp;&nbsp;

30
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:01,920
Also, the default gateway is 192.168.1.254,&nbsp;
which must be R1’s IP address. So, let me add&nbsp;&nbsp;

31
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:13,760
those labels. Network address of 192.168.1.0/24.&nbsp;
.1 for PC1’s address. And .254 for R1’s address.

32
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:22,000
Now I’ll move to SW1. So, we need to add&nbsp;
interface labels for step 1, and disable CDP on&nbsp;&nbsp;

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,040
the interface connected to PC1 for step 2. First&nbsp;
let’s add the interface labels. ENABLE. So, let’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

34
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:39,520
check the CDP neighbor table. SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS.&nbsp;
Okay, so we can see that SW1’s Gig0/1 interface&nbsp;&nbsp;

35
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:49,840
is connected to R1’s Gig0/2 interface. Let me add&nbsp;
those labels now. G0/1 for SW1, and G0/2 for R1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

36
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,360
Now, how about the interface connected to&nbsp;
PC1? PC1 doesn’t use CDP, so we have to use a&nbsp;&nbsp;

37
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:04,400
different method. If there were many PCs connected&nbsp;
to SW1, we could check the MAC address of each PC,&nbsp;&nbsp;

38
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,600
and then look at SW1’s MAC address table to see&nbsp;
which interface is assigned to which MAC address.&nbsp;&nbsp;

39
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,640
However, I’m keeping it simple in this lab, only&nbsp;
1 PC is connected to each switch, so instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

40
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:25,600
let’s just check which interface of SW1 is in a&nbsp;
‘connected’ state. SHOW INTERFACES STATUS. Gig0/1&nbsp;&nbsp;

41
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,360
is connected to R1, and the only other interface&nbsp;
in a ‘connected’ state is FastEthernet0/10,&nbsp;&nbsp;

42
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:41,200
so that must be connected to PC1. I’ll add that&nbsp;
label now, F0/10 connected to PC1. But we’re not&nbsp;&nbsp;

43
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:48,960
done with SW1 yet, let’s return to the CLI. Next&nbsp;
I’ll disable CDP on F0/10, as stated in step 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:59,920
CONF T. INTERFACE F0/10. First let’s check&nbsp;
with this command, DO SHOW CDP INTERFACE F0/10.&nbsp;&nbsp;

45
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:07,360
So, CDP is enabled on the interface.&nbsp;
Now let’s disable it. NO CDP ENABLE.&nbsp;&nbsp;

46
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,840
Remember, CDP RUN is used in global config&nbsp;
mode to enable or disable CDP itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

47
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,360
CDP ENABLE is used in interface config mode to&nbsp;
enable or disable CDP on individual interfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;

48
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,440
Okay, let’s check that it was disabled. DO&nbsp;&nbsp;

49
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,240
SHOW CDP INTERFACE F0/10. And now there is no&nbsp;
output, so CDP was disabled on the interface.

50
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:43,040
That’s all for SW1, now I’ll go on R1. ENABLE.&nbsp;
First I’ll add interface labels by checking&nbsp;&nbsp;

51
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:53,600
SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS. We already labeled G0/2 and&nbsp;
SW1’s G0/1. So, R1’s G0/0 is connected to R3’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

52
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:06,080
G0/1, let me label those. G0/0 for R1, and G0/1&nbsp;
for R3. Then, R1’s G0/1 interface is connected&nbsp;&nbsp;

53
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:17,760
to R2’s G0/0 interface, I’ll label them. G0/1 for&nbsp;
R1, G0/0 for R2. So, we’ve added interface labels,&nbsp;&nbsp;

54
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:24,000
now let’s check R1’s IP address.&nbsp;
First I’ll use SHOW INTERFACES G0/0.&nbsp;&nbsp;

55
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,240
Up here at the top you can see both the IP&nbsp;
address and the /30 prefix length. SHOW IP&nbsp;&nbsp;

56
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,760
INTERFACE BRIEF is a convenient way to check IP&nbsp;
addresses, but it doesn’t show the prefix length.&nbsp;&nbsp;

57
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:45,840
So, I’ll add the 10.0.13.0/30 network label&nbsp;
for this connection between R1 and R3,&nbsp;&nbsp;

58
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:54,880
and .1 for R1’s IP address. Now, because&nbsp;
this is a /30 subnet, there is only one more&nbsp;&nbsp;

59
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:02,240
valid host address in the network, that is .2.&nbsp;
So, I’ll add that label for R3’s interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;

60
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:10,240
However, just to practice CDP let’s confirm R3’s&nbsp;
address here on R1. Use the command SHOW CDP ENTRY&nbsp;&nbsp;

61
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:18,160
R3. Up here under the device name you&nbsp;
can see R3’s IP address, 10.0.13.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

62
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:29,840
Now let’s check R1’s G0/1 interface. SHOW&nbsp;
INTERFACES G0/1. The IP address is 10.0.12.1/30,&nbsp;&nbsp;

63
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,880
so let’s add those labels. 10.0.12.0/30&nbsp;
for the network address, .1 for R1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

64
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,720
and once again this is a /30 network&nbsp;
so we know that R2’s address is .2.

65
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,400
Okay, let’s speed things up for the remaining&nbsp;
labels. I’ll do PC2, SW2, and R2 next,&nbsp;&nbsp;

66
00:07:52,400 --> 00:08:04,560
first PC2. From the CLI of PC2, use IPCONFIG.&nbsp;
So, PC2’s address is 192.168.2.1/24, and R2’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

67
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:15,200
address is 192.168.2.254. Let’s add those labels.&nbsp;
First, the network address of 192.168.2.0/24. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

68
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:27,920
.1 for PC2 and .254 for R2. Next I’ll move on to&nbsp;
SW2. ENABLE. Let’s check CDP. SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

69
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,640
Okay, here we can see that SW2’s G0/2&nbsp;
interface is connected to R2’s G0/1 interface,&nbsp;&nbsp;

70
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:46,480
let’s add those labels. G0/2 for SW2, and&nbsp;
G0/1 for R2. Sorry for the messy diagram,&nbsp;&nbsp;

71
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,800
sometimes it’s difficult to make all of&nbsp;
the text big enough for everyone to see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

72
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,240
while still fitting it all on one screen.&nbsp;
Now, which interface is connected to PC2?&nbsp;&nbsp;

73
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,280
SHOW INTERFACES STATUS. The&nbsp;
FastEthernet0/1 interface is ‘connected’,&nbsp;&nbsp;

74
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:10,160
so I’ll add that label, F0/1. Finally&nbsp;
let’s disable CDP on that interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;

75
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:18,880
CONF T. INTERFACE F0/1. NO CDP&nbsp;
ENABLE. Okay, that’s all for SW2.

76
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:28,320
Next, R2. All we need to check is the&nbsp;
connection between R2 and R3. ENABLE.&nbsp;&nbsp;

77
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:37,200
SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS. So, R2’s G0/2 interface&nbsp;
is connected to R3’s G0/2 interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;

78
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,000
I’ll add those labels now, G0/2 for both routers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

79
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,560
Now, how about the IP addresses?&nbsp;
Let’s check. SHOW INTERFACE G0/2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

80
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:59,360
Okay, R2’s IP address is 10.0.23.1/30.&nbsp;
So, we know the network address is&nbsp;&nbsp;

81
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:06,960
10.0.23.0/30, and R3’s address must&nbsp;
be 10.0.23.2. Let’s add those labels.&nbsp;&nbsp;

82
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:17,840
10.0.23.0/30 for the network, .1 for&nbsp;
R2 and .2 for R3. That’s all for R2.

83
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:30,160
Next I’ll do the same for PC3, SW3, and R3.&nbsp;
PC3 first. From PC3’s CLI use IPCONFIG. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

84
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:38,960
PC3’s IP address is 192.168.3.1/24,&nbsp;
and R3’s IP address is 192.168.3.254.&nbsp;&nbsp;

85
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:52,160
Let’s label them. 192.168.3.0/24 for the network,&nbsp;
.1 for PC3 and .254 for R3. Next I’ll go on SW3.&nbsp;&nbsp;

86
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:04,960
ENABLE. SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS. Okay, SW3’s G0/1&nbsp;
interface is connected to R3’s G0/0 interface,&nbsp;&nbsp;

87
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:16,400
let me label those. G0/1 for SW3, and G0/0 for R3.&nbsp;
Next, which interface of SW3 is connected to PC3?&nbsp;&nbsp;

88
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:24,800
SHOW INTERFACES STATUS. FastEthernet0/24&nbsp;
is ‘connected’, so I’ll add that label.&nbsp;&nbsp;

89
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,120
And finally let’s disable CDP on that interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;

90
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:41,920
CONF T. INTERFACE F0/24. NO CDP ENABLE. Okay, we&nbsp;
have successfully used CDP to map out the network,&nbsp;&nbsp;

91
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,680
and disabled CDP on interfaces connected&nbsp;
to PCs. Steps 1 and 2 are complete.

92
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,440
Next, in steps 3 and 4 let’s disable CDP&nbsp;
and enable LLDP instead, enabling both LLDP&nbsp;&nbsp;

93
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,840
TRANSMIT and RECEIVE on the interfaces&nbsp;
connected to other routers or switches.&nbsp;&nbsp;

94
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,480
First, let me clarify something about LLDP&nbsp;
configurations. In the lecture I said you&nbsp;&nbsp;

95
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:15,120
have to enable LLDP globally and on each&nbsp;
interface, but actually the LLDP RUN command&nbsp;&nbsp;

96
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,200
should enable LLDP TRANSMIT and RECEIVE on each&nbsp;
interface. This might depend on the model of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

97
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:28,160
device. On some devices, LLDP itself is globally&nbsp;
enabled by default. But on the ones I tested&nbsp;&nbsp;

98
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:36,080
these configurations on, configuring LLDP RUN also&nbsp;
enabled LLDP on each interface. For the purpose of&nbsp;&nbsp;

99
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:42,560
this lab, however, LLDP TRANSMIT and RECEIVE have&nbsp;
been disabled and must be manually configured.&nbsp;&nbsp;

100
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,200
The configurations are quite simple,&nbsp;
so I’ll go through these quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

101
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:58,000
I’ll start here on SW3. First, EXIT to return to&nbsp;
global config mode. I’ll disable CDP. NO CDP RUN.&nbsp;&nbsp;

102
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:07,120
And then enable LLDP. LLDP RUN. Now, we need to&nbsp;
enable LLDP on each interface connected to another&nbsp;&nbsp;

103
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:20,560
network device, G0/1 only on SW3. INTERFACE&nbsp;
G0/1. LLDP TRANSMIT. LLDP RECEIVE. Okay, next R3.&nbsp;&nbsp;

104
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:33,840
ENABLE. CONF T. NO CDP RUN. LLDP RUN. Next I’ll&nbsp;
enable it on all three connected interfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;

105
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:45,360
INTERFACE RANGE G0/0 – 2. LLDP&nbsp;
TRANSMIT. LLDP RECEIVE. Okay, R3’s done.

106
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:58,880
Next I’ll do SW2. EXIT. NO CDP RUN.&nbsp;
LLDP RUN. And I’ll enable it on G0/2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

107
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:16,640
INTERFACE G0/2. LLDP TRANSMIT. LLDP RECEIVE. Okay,&nbsp;
next R2. CONF T. NO CDP RUN. LLDP RUN. And let’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

108
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:27,360
enable it on all connected interfaces. INTERFACE&nbsp;
RANGE G0/0 – 2. LLDP TRANSMIT. LLDP RECEIVE.

109
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,880
Okay, finally SW1 and R1, SW1 first.&nbsp;&nbsp;

110
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:50,640
EXIT. NO CDP RUN. LLDP RUN. INTERFACE G0/1.&nbsp;
LLDP TRANSMIT. LLDP RECEIVE. And last, R1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

111
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:07,680
CONF T. NO CDP RUN. LLDP RUN. INTERFACE&nbsp;
RANGE G0/0 – 2. LLDP TRANSMIT. LLDP RECEIVE.&nbsp;&nbsp;

112
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Okay, we’ve enabled LLDP on all devices. I’m going&nbsp;
to switch to Packet Tracer’s simulation mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;

113
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,080
As I click through here, you’ll see&nbsp;
various kinds of messages being sent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

114
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,000
EIGRP, because I pre-configured EIGRP&nbsp;
on the routers in case you want to try&nbsp;&nbsp;

115
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,040
out some pings. Also STP, and LLDP.&nbsp;
You might see some DTP messages too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

116
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,840
So, with this we can confirm that CDP has&nbsp;
been disabled and LLDP has been enabled.&nbsp;&nbsp;

117
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,160
If you want some additional practice, you could&nbsp;
try checking the interface and IP address labels,&nbsp;&nbsp;

118
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,400
this time using LLDP instead of CDP.&nbsp;
But that’s all for this lab. Next,&nbsp;&nbsp;

119
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,960
let’s take a look at a bonus lab in&nbsp;
Boson Software’s NetSim for CCNA.

120
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,200
Okay, here's today's Boson NetSim lab preview.&nbsp;
The lab is simply titled Link-Layer Discovery&nbsp;&nbsp;

121
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:11,440
Protocol. Here is the lab topology. It's pretty&nbsp;
simple, just two routers directly connected.&nbsp;&nbsp;

122
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,680
As I have said before, NetSim has a wide variety&nbsp;
of labs. Some of them are longer and more complex,&nbsp;&nbsp;

123
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,680
and some of them are shorter and simpler&nbsp;
like this one. And here are the commands&nbsp;&nbsp;

124
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,800
you need to know to complete this lab.&nbsp;
You already know all of these commands.&nbsp;&nbsp;

125
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:35,680
LLDP HOLDTIME, RECEIVE, RUN, TIMER, TRANSMIT,&nbsp;
and some SHOW commands. So there are three main&nbsp;&nbsp;

126
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:45,600
tasks. Task 1 is Configure LLDP. Task 2 Configure&nbsp;
LLDP on an Interface. And task 3 Tune LLDP Timers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

127
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,840
So looks pretty long, but each of these steps is&nbsp;
quite short and simple, so let's do the whole lab.&nbsp;&nbsp;

128
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:59,040
So starting with Task 1, step 1. It says up here,&nbsp;
all steps in this task are performed on Router1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

129
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,880
So here we are. Step 1, display global LLDP&nbsp;
information. Is LLDP running? Let's check.&nbsp;&nbsp;

130
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:20,800
SHOW LLDP. Okay, no LLDP is not running at the&nbsp;
moment. And then step 2 says enable LLDP. CONF T.&nbsp;&nbsp;

131
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:27,840
LLDP RUN. So, that enables&nbsp;
LLDP globally on the device,&nbsp;&nbsp;

132
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:35,040
and as I clarified before this also should enable&nbsp;
TRANSMIT and RECEIVE on each interface. I think in&nbsp;&nbsp;

133
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,960
the lecture I said you have to enable it globally&nbsp;
and then enable TRANSMIT and RECEIVE but actually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

134
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,920
usually just LLDP RUN should be enough. But this&nbsp;
might depend on the device model or IOS version.&nbsp;&nbsp;

135
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:57,120
Okay, so display a summarized list, or sorry&nbsp;
I skipped step 3. Issue the appropriate SHOW&nbsp;&nbsp;

136
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:04,800
command to verify that LLDP is enabled. So,&nbsp;
I'll do SHOW LLDP once more. And it is enabled,&nbsp;&nbsp;

137
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:14,800
it says status: ACTIVE. Okay, now I'll show that&nbsp;
LLDP neighbor list. DO SHOW LLDP NEIGHBORS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

138
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,400
How many neighbors have been discovered?&nbsp;
Just one here, Router2. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

139
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,760
step 5. Display a detailed list of neighbors.&nbsp;
Okay, so that is SHOW LLDP NEIGHBORS DETAIL.&nbsp;&nbsp;

140
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,240
And what is the chassis ID of the neighbor&nbsp;
discovered? So you might be wondering what&nbsp;&nbsp;

141
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,880
that chassis ID is. That is this here. And what&nbsp;
does that look like? It's a MAC address. So this&nbsp;&nbsp;

142
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:49,760
is the MAC address of Router2. Okay, how many&nbsp;
seconds will elapse before Router1 discards&nbsp;&nbsp;

143
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,440
previously received LLDP information for this&nbsp;
neighbor? Okay, you might be wondering what&nbsp;&nbsp;

144
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,640
that means. That is referring to the hold time.&nbsp;
So it is currently the default of 120 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

145
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,800
But at the moment there are 97 seconds&nbsp;
remaining, or when I did this SHOW command&nbsp;&nbsp;

146
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:12,240
there were 97 seconds. If I do that again, now&nbsp;
it's a different value, now it's 93 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

147
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:24,640
Okay, so that is task 1. Next task 2 step 1.&nbsp;
Display LLDP information for the FastEthernet0/0&nbsp;&nbsp;

148
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:38,720
interface. Okay, DO SHOW LLDP INTERFACE F0/0.&nbsp;
Okay, what fields indicate that FastEthernet0/0 is&nbsp;&nbsp;

149
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:46,880
receiving and sending LLDP advertisements? Well,&nbsp;
you can see that both Tx and Rx are enabled. Tx is&nbsp;&nbsp;

150
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:54,560
currently IDLE, meaning it's waiting to send the&nbsp;
next frame, and Rx is in WAIT FOR FRAME state, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

151
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:02,080
that means it is waiting for the next frame from&nbsp;
Router2. Okay, disable LLDP advertisements from&nbsp;&nbsp;

152
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:11,120
being sent out of the FastEthernet0/0 interface.&nbsp;
Okay, INTERFACE F0/0. And I will use NO LLDP&nbsp;&nbsp;

153
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,360
TRANSMIT. And that disables the&nbsp;
advertisements out of the interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;

154
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,240
Okay, and then in step 4 let's&nbsp;
check that they were disabled.&nbsp;&nbsp;

155
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:35,040
Okay, so Tx is now disabled. However Rx is still&nbsp;
enabled. So, Router1 will still be able to receive&nbsp;&nbsp;

156
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,960
LLDP messages from Router2, but it won't&nbsp;
send any of its own messages to Router2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

157
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:52,080
Okay, and then step 5 says to configure Router1&nbsp;
to accept incoming LLDP advertisements, well&nbsp;&nbsp;

158
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:59,280
it already is, Rx is enabled, and to send LLDP&nbsp;
advertisements on the FastEthernet0/0 interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;

159
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:08,960
Okay, so that means enable TRANSMIT once more.&nbsp;
So, LLDP TRANSMIT. And it's enabled again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

160
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:18,080
Okay finally task 3, tune LLDP timers.&nbsp;
Step 1, display global LLDP information.&nbsp;&nbsp;

161
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,200
What is the default number of seconds that&nbsp;
will elapse before an LLDP advertisement is&nbsp;&nbsp;

162
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:30,080
sent? So that is by default 30 seconds. And next,&nbsp;
what is the default number of seconds that will&nbsp;&nbsp;

163
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,200
elapse before a receiving device&nbsp;
should discard information received&nbsp;&nbsp;

164
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,160
in a previously received LLDP advertisement&nbsp;
message from Router1? That might be a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

165
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,680
difficult to understand, that is referring to&nbsp;
the holdtime. And that is by default 120 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

166
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,880
And there are the default timers. 30 seconds&nbsp;
for the advertisements, the messages,&nbsp;&nbsp;

167
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,520
120 second holdtime, and also the reinitialization&nbsp;
delay of 2 seconds, which isn't mentioned up here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

168
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,560
Okay, and then in steps 2 and 3 we are&nbsp;
going to cut these defaults in half. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

169
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:16,000
a 60 second hold time and 15 second&nbsp;
message timer. Okay, so LLDP HOLDTIME 60.&nbsp;&nbsp;

170
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:26,880
LLDP TIMER 15. And let's check. DO SHOW&nbsp;
LLDP. Okay, there are the new timers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

171
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,600
Okay, so that's all for this lab. To finish up&nbsp;
let's use the grading function. And that is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

172
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:42,000
icon up here, it says grade lab. So if I click&nbsp;
on it, it tells us that we completed the lab&nbsp;&nbsp;

173
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:50,800
successfully. And you can check the configurations&nbsp;
of each device. Here's Router1. And none of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

174
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:57,040
configurations are highlighted either red or blue,&nbsp;
so that means that we successfully completed the lab.&nbsp;&nbsp;

175
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,840
Okay so that's Boson NetSim for the&nbsp;
CCNA. If you want to get Boson NetSim,&nbsp;&nbsp;

it's included with a powerful network simulator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

178
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,080
So I really highly recommend Boson NetSim&nbsp;
for the CCNA, or even CCNP after the CCNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;
