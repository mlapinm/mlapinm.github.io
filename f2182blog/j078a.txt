5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,330
In this video we will cover Syslog. Syslog
is a protocol used to keep logs of various

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,130
events that happen on the device, for example
interfaces going up or down, OSPF neighbor

7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:36,030
relationships going up or down, etc. The log
messages can be shown in real-time in the

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,960
CLI of the device to inform you of important
events as they occur, and they can also be

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,539
stored in the device or on an external server
and examined later. These logs are very important,

10
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:53,739
so understanding Syslog is essential for network
admins and engineers. Syslog is mentioned

11
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:59,379
in exam topic 4.5, which says you must be
able to describe the use of syslog features

12
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:04,489
including facilities and levels. In this video
I plan to cover everything you need to know

13
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,860
about Syslog for the CCNA.

14
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,311
Here’s what we’ll cover in this video.
First I’ll give a brief overview of Syslog

15
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:18,250
and outline how it works. Then I’ll introduce
the Syslog message format. Syslog messages

16
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,680
have a standard format, and it’s important
that you know the format so you can read and

17
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,850
understand Syslog messages. Then I’ll introduce
the various Syslog facilities and severity

18
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,800
levels. You probably aren’t sure exactly
what ‘facility’ and ‘severity’ mean

19
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,820
yet, but they were both mentioned in the exam
topics list so we’ll cover them in this

20
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:45,790
video. Then I’ll introduce some basic Syslog
configurations. Just like SNMP, Syslog configuration

21
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,810
isn’t mentioned in the exam topics, but
I think it’s important to get some hands-on

22
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:56,360
practice. So, I’ll go over the basic Syslog
configuration commands. Make sure to watch

23
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,990
until the end of the video for a bonus practice
question from Boson Software’s ExSim for

24
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,620
CCNA, the best practice exams for the CCNA.

25
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,710
Here’s a quick overview of Syslog. Syslog
is an industry standard protocol for message

26
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:17,710
logging. On network devices, Syslog can be
used to log events such as changes in interface

27
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:22,840
status, changes in OSPF neighbor status, or
neighbor status in other routing protocols

28
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:30,100
like EIGRP and BGP, also system restarts,
etc. Tons of different events can be logged,

29
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,850
so I’m not going to try to list them all.
The messages can be displayed in the CLI as

30
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:40,900
you configure the device, saved in the device’s
RAM, or sent to an external Syslog server.

31
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,010
I’m sure you’ve seen these messages as
you configure devices in Packet Tracer. For

32
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:52,070
example, I used NO SHUTDOWN to enable a router
interface. Notice that two Syslog messages

33
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:58,040
are displayed, indicating that the interface
state has changed to UP. Logs are essential

34
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:04,420
when troubleshooting issues, examining the
cause of incidents, etc. Syslog and SNMP are

35
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:10,100
both used for monitoring and troubleshooting
devices. They are complementary to each other,

36
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,980
but their functionalities are quite different.
After covering Syslog in this video, I’ll

37
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,920
give a brief summary of how Syslog and SNMP
are different at the end.

38
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,480
Now let’s take a look at the Syslog message
format. There are the fields you can expect

39
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,080
to see in a standard Syslog message. Let’s
go through them. First, there is a sequence

40
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,720
number indicating the order, the sequence,
of the log messages. Next there is a timestamp

41
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,660
indicating at what time the message was generated.
These timestamps are particularly important,

42
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,709
especially when comparing the logs of different
devices. Assuming both devices have accurate

43
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:52,480
time thanks to NTP, you can use these timestamps
to compare when different events occurred

44
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,319
on different devices. Note that these two
fields may or may not be displayed, depending

45
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,380
on the device’s configuration. Sequence
numbers are often not used, however the timestamps

46
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:10,819
are very important and I highly recommend
including them in Syslog messages. Next there

47
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:15,849
is the facility, this is a value that indicates
which process on the device generated this

48
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:22,419
message. For example, if OSPF generated the
message when an OSPF neighbor came up, OSPF

49
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:28,660
would be displayed in this field. Next is
the severity, which indicates the severity

50
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:35,740
of the event. Some messages are just informational,
simply letting you know that something happened.

51
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:41,230
Other messages indicate something much more
serious that might need to be dealt with immediately.

52
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:46,370
There are 8 severity levels, and you’ll
need to know them all for the exam. Then there

53
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,490
is a mnemonic, which is a short code for the
message that indicates what happened. For

54
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,720
example, if the facility is OSPF, this mnemonic
might be a code indicating that the message

55
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,400
is about OSPF neighbor adjacencies. If the
facility is LINK, it might be a code indicating

56
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:09,630
that the message is about an interface going
up or down. Finally, there is the description.

57
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,560
This is the detailed information about the
event being reported, about what actually

58
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,740
happened.

59
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,630
Before looking at some examples of Syslog
messages, let’s cover the different Syslog

60
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:25,490
severity levels. As I briefly mentioned, these
levels indicate how serious, how severe, the

61
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:31,280
event is. For example, something like a serious
hardware failure is more severe than an OSPF

62
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,531
neighbor moving to the FULL state. There are
8 severity levels, as displayed here. Each

63
00:05:37,531 --> 00:05:43,681
severity level has a number, 0 being the most
severe and 7 being the least severe. Each

64
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:49,260
level also has a keyword, which is a name
identifying the level. Then there is a brief

65
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:55,370
description. I took these descriptions directly
from the official RFC for Syslog. First there

66
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:02,090
is level 0, emergency, events which render
the system unusable. Level 1, alert, is for

67
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:08,510
events for which action must be taken immediately.
So, these are also very serious events. Level

68
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:13,810
2 is called critical, and the description
is simply ‘critical conditions’. Same

69
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:20,370
for level 3, error, and level 4, warning.
Next is level 5, notice, used for messages

70
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:27,060
representing a ‘normal but significant condition’.
In the official RFC for Syslog, the keyword

71
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:33,160
for level 5 is ‘Notice’, but in the CLI
of Cisco IOS the name is Notification, so

72
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:40,520
make sure you know of both names. Notice and
Notification for level 5. Level 6 is ‘Informational’,

73
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:46,360
and then finally the least severe level, level
7, is Debugging. These are the least severe

74
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,090
messages. Now, the RFC doesn’t give detailed
definitions about exactly what events fit

75
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:57,990
into each severity level. So, each vendor
will interpret these levels differently. Here’s

76
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:04,800
a quote from the RFC. Because severities are
very subjective, a relay or collector (basically

77
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,640
that means a Syslog server) should not assume
that all originators have the same definition

78
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:16,520
of severity. That’s from RFC 5424, The Syslog
Protocol, which is free to read online if

79
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,460
you Google it. Basically it means that you
shouldn’t expect a Cisco router’s ‘Warning’

80
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:26,700
level to be exactly the same as a Juniper
router’s ‘Warning’ level, for example.

81
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:32,650
Each vendor may interpret each level differently.
For the CCNA exam, make sure you have memorized

82
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:38,570
the levels and keywords. You should know that
level 1 is Alert, and Informational is level

83
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:44,830
6, for example. If you want some help remembering
them, here’s a mnemonic. Every Awesome Cisco

84
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:50,710
Engineer Will Need Ice cream Daily. Just like
the OSI model, if you know any other good

85
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:55,000
ways to remember these levels post them in
the comment section!

86
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,210
Let’s look at some examples of Syslog messages.
Here’s one, first there’s the timestamp,

87
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:08,199
indicating the month, date, hours, minutes,
seconds, and milliseconds. Notice that there

88
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,520
is no sequence number before the timestamp.
As I mentioned earlier, the sequence number

89
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,130
and timestamp fields may or may not be displayed,
depending on the device’s configuration.

90
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:26,270
Here’s the facility, LINK. And the severity
is 3. The mnemonic is UPDOWN, which tells

91
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:31,710
us the message is about an interface going
up or down. Finally, here’s the description,

92
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:38,019
which tells us exactly what happened. Interface
gigabitethernet0/0 changed state to up. So,

93
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:43,419
that’s an example Syslog message. Make sure
you’re able to identify each part of this

94
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:49,000
message. For example, you might be asked,
what’s the facility of this Syslog message?

95
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,990
You should be able to answer ‘LINK’. Or
if asked about the severity, you should be

96
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,371
able to answer ‘3’ or ‘error’, depending
on the options. I can’t say for sure, but

97
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:03,839
judging by the exam topics list those seem
like the kind of question you can expect on

98
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,230
the exam. Okay, let’s see some more examples.
Here’s a message about an OSPF neighbor

99
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:17,529
moving to the FULL state. The facility is
OSPF, and IOS declares this a level 5, notification

100
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:26,360
level, message. The mnemonic is A D J C H
G, adjacency change. Here’s another example,

101
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,220
and for this one I turned on the sequence
numbers so you can see what it looks like.

102
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:37,110
In this case the facility is SYS for system,
the severity is 5 again, and remember those

103
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:44,040
keywords for level 5, ‘notice’ or ‘notification’.
And the mnemonic is CONFIG_I, with a description

104
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,949
of ‘configured from console by jeremy on
console.’ You get messages like this when

105
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:56,110
you exit global config mode and return to
privileged exec mode. And one more example,

106
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,550
this time I just changed the timezone from
UTC to JST and this messages was displayed.

107
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:07,250
Again, the facility is SYS, but this time
the severity is 6. What’s the keyword for

108
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:13,730
level 6? It’s ‘informational’. And the
mnemonic is CLOCKUPDATE. So, once again make

109
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,240
sure you can identify each part of a Syslog
message, it’s stated directly in the exam

110
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,360
topics list.

111
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,819
Soon we’ll take a look at how to configure
Syslog in the CLI, but before that here’s

112
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:30,579
an overview of the different locations Syslog
messages can be sent to. First is the console

113
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:35,360
line. This means that Syslog messages will
be displayed when connected to the device

114
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,920
via the console port. By default, all messages,
from level 0 through level 7, are displayed

115
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,959
when connected to the CLI via the device’s
console port. In Packet Tracer, for example,

116
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:52,439
when you click on a device and go to the CLI
tab, it operates as if you’re connected

117
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:58,040
via the console port of the device. So, that’s
why Syslog messages are displayed when configuring

118
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:05,329
devices in packet tracer via the CLI tab.
Okay, the next location is the VTY lines.

119
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:10,089
This means that Syslog messages will be displayed
in the CLI when connected to the device via

120
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:17,379
Telnet or SSH. Telnet and SSH will be covered
in a later video. They are protocols used

121
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:22,009
to connect to a device over a network, without
being directly connected to the device’s

122
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:27,499
console port. Logging to the VTY lines is
disabled by default, so Syslog messages will

123
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:33,939
not be displayed if you’re connecting to
the device via Telnet or SSH. So, if you shutdown

124
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:39,939
an interface, for example, no message will
be displayed. The next location for Syslog

125
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:44,480
messages is the ‘buffer’ of the device.
This means that Syslog messages will be saved

126
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:51,420
to RAM. By default, all messages, from level
0 to level 7, will be displayed in the buffer.

127
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,779
You can view the messages in the buffer with
the SHOW LOGGING command. We’ll take a look

128
00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:01,029
at that command in the lab video. You can
also configure the device to send Syslog messages

129
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:06,259
to an external server. This is very useful,
especially in large networks, but also in

130
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:11,790
small networks. Having a central server for
the Syslog messages makes network management

131
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:17,930
easier and makes it easier to compare the
logs of multiple devices. By the way, Syslog

132
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:24,899
servers will listen for Syslog messages on
UDP port 514. So, if a device sends a Syslog

133
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:31,589
message to a Syslog server, the destination
port will be UDP 514. Remember that!

134
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:36,899
So here are some basic Syslog configurations.
First, at the top, configuring logging to

135
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:42,629
the console line. This is enabled by default,
but here’s how you configure it. The command

136
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:48,730
is LOGGING CONSOLE, followed by the level.
I specified 6. Note that, in all of these

137
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:54,059
commands, you can specify either the number
or the keyword of the level. So in this case

138
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:59,989
I specified 6, but I could have used the keyword
INFORMATIONAL instead. Also note that this

139
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:05,029
doesn’t only enable informational messages.
This enables logging for informational severity

140
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:12,379
and higher, so informational to emergency,
which includes levels 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and

141
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:17,470
0. By default the console logs all messages,
including level 7, debugging, so setting the

142
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:22,809
level to 6 actually slightly restricts the
messages that will be displayed via the console.

143
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:28,529
Okay, next the command to configure logging
to the VTY lines is LOGGING MONITOR, followed

144
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:34,389
by the level. Just like above, you can specify
the level number or keyword, this time I used

145
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:39,850
the keyword of INFORMATIONAL instead of the
level, 6. Next, to configure logging to the

146
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:45,160
buffer the command is LOGGING BUFFERED, followed
by the size of the buffer in bytes and the

147
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,040
level. The size is optional, if you don’t
specify it the device will use its default

148
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,339
size. Just be careful not to set the buffer
size too large, because that can take system

149
00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:01,709
memory away from other essential operations.
Also to repeat, to specify the logging level

150
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:06,439
you can use either the number or the keyword,
and it enables logging for not only level

151
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:13,449
6 but also levels 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0. Finally,
logging to an external server can be configured

152
00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:20,629
with LOGGING, followed by the server IP, or
LOGGING HOST, followed by the server IP. The

153
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:25,619
commands are the same, you can use whichever.
Now, to configure the levels of messages sent

154
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:30,889
to the external server, you need to use a
different command. It’s LOGGING TRAP, followed

155
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:36,110
by the level. This time I specified DEBUGGING,
but once again I could have used the level

156
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:43,180
number of 7 instead. This enables logging
of all levels, not just 7 but also 6, 5, 4,

157
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:48,819
3, 2, 1, and 0. So, that’s how you enable
Syslog logging to different locations and

158
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:55,069
specify which levels of messages should be
displayed. Because Syslog configuration isn’t

159
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:59,019
specified in the exam topics, you probably
don’t have to memorize these commands for

160
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:04,069
the exam. However, I will include flashcards
for them and also you can get some practice

161
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:08,069
with them in the following lab video.

162
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:13,730
Let me introduce another command. Even if
LOGGING MONITOR is enabled, by default Syslog

163
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:19,420
messages will not be displayed when connected
via Telnet or SSH. You need another command,

164
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,850
too. For the messages to be displayed, you
must use the following command: TERMINAL MONITOR,

165
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,759
from privileged exec mode. But not only that,
this command must be used every time you connect

166
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:35,989
to the device via Telnet or SSH. So, if you
connect via SSH and use the TERMINAL MONITOR

167
00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:41,800
command, Syslog messages will be displayed
as you configure the device. However, after

168
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,449
you log out, that ‘session’ is finished
and the TERMINAL MONITOR command is no longer

169
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:52,309
effective. To display Syslog messages in the
CLI when you connect again next time, you’ll

170
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:58,259
need to use the TERMINAL MONITOR command again.
I’ll demonstrate this in the lab video.

171
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:03,760
This next command isn’t essential, but very
convenient. By default, logging messages displayed

172
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,829
in the CLI while you are in the middle of
typing a command will result in something

173
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:14,179
like this. Notice in the middle of typing
SHOW IP IN, the log message was displayed.

174
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:19,939
I continued typing the command, and the command
continued right after the log message. I changed

175
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:23,829
the color of the command to make it easier
to see, but when this actually happens in

176
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:29,889
the CLI it can be hard to see where the Syslog
message ends and where the command continues.

177
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:34,790
To prevent this, you should use the logging
synchronous command on the appropriate line,

178
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:40,000
and I will talk more about ‘line’ configuration
in the Telnet and SSH video. You don’t need

179
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,100
to learn this yet, but for example here’s
how you can enter the console line, LINE CONSOLE

180
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,870
0, and then configure LOGGING SYNCHRONOUS.
This will cause a new line to be printed if

181
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:57,519
your typing is interrupted by a message. Here’s
an example. I typed SHOW IP INT, a log message

182
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:03,790
was displayed, and then SHOW IP INT was reprinted
on a new line. This makes it easier to continue

183
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:09,150
typing the command. So, this is a nice command
to know and a command I usually use when doing

184
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,190
labs. It just makes things easier to see.

185
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:19,490
Okay, the last two commands I want to show
you are SERVICE TIMESTAMPS and SERVICE SEQUENCE-NUMBERS.

186
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,320
This is how you control whether or not the
timestamps and sequence numbers will be displayed

187
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:30,920
in Syslog messages. To enable timestamps for
Syslog messages, use SERVICE TIMESTAMPS LOG,

188
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:36,670
followed either by DATETIME or UPTIME. If
you specify DATETIME, timestamps will display

189
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:42,420
the actual date and time when the event occurred.
If you specify UPTIME, timestamps won’t

190
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,760
display the date and time, they will display
how long the device had been running when

191
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:52,830
the event occurred. DATETIME is usually the
preferred option, so that’s what I chose.

192
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:58,280
Then I enabled sequence numbers with the SERVICE
SEQUENCE-NUMBERS command. After I exit global

193
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:04,560
config mode, you can see that the Syslog message
has both a sequence number and a timestamp.

194
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,670
I think it’s a good idea to always enable
timestamps, although personally I don’t

195
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:13,080
find sequence numbers particularly useful,
so I prefer to keep them disabled.

196
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,910
Here’s a summary of the commands I just
showed you. I think trying these out in a

197
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:23,080
lab will be very helpful, not just for remembering
the commands but for understanding how Syslog

198
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:29,190
works. So make sure to watch the next video
and try out the lab yourself in Packet Tracer.

199
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:36,880
Finally, here’s a brief comparison of Syslog
and SNMP. As I said before, Syslog and SNMP

200
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,850
are both used for monitoring and troubleshooting
of devices. They are complementary, but their

201
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:47,830
functionalities are different. Syslog is used
for message logging. Events that occur within

202
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:53,610
the system are categorized based on facility
and severity and logged, both within the device

203
00:18:53,610 --> 00:19:00,120
and likely to an external Syslog server. Syslog
is used for system management, analysis, and

204
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,650
troubleshooting. Here’s a big difference.
Messages are sent from the devices to the

205
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:10,680
server, but the server can’t actively pull
information from the devices, like an SNMP

206
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:19,400
Get message, or modify variables on the devices,
like an SNMP Set message. Now SNMP. It is

207
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:25,050
used to retrieve and organize information
about the SNMP managed devices. Things like

208
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:31,560
IP addresses, current interface status, device
temperature, CPU usage, etc are stored as

209
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:38,480
variables and organized within the MIB. SNMP
servers can use Get to query the clients and

210
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,160
Set to modify variables on the clients. Syslog
and SNMP are used together to facilitate network

211
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:51,470
device management, and you need to be familiar
with both of them for the test.

212
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:56,250
Before the quiz, here’s a review of what
we covered today. First I gave a brief overview

213
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:02,020
of Syslog. It’s an industry standard protocol
for logging events that occur on devices.

214
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:08,601
I introduced the Syslog message format, as
well as facilities and severity levels. Make

215
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:13,040
sure you know all of those severity level
numbers and names, and make sure you can identify

216
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:19,760
the different parts of a Syslog message. Finally,
I showed you some basic Syslog configurations.

217
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,020
You probably won’t be asked about Syslog
configuration on the exam, but I think the

218
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:28,930
hands-on practice in Packet Tracer will be
very helpful. Make sure to watch until the

219
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:34,000
end of the quiz for a bonus practice question
from Boson Software’s ExSim, the best practice

220
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
exams for the CCNA, and the ones I used to
prepare for my exams. Okay, let’s go to

221
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,160
question 1 of the quiz.

222
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:48,851
What is the severity level of the following
Syslog message? Here are the options. Pause

223
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:56,750
the video now to examine the message and select
the correct answer.

224
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:02,870
The answer is C, Notification. This is indicated
by the 5 here, between the facility and the

225
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:09,010
mnemonic. This severity level is called ‘Notice’
in the RFC for Syslog, but it’s also known

226
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:15,990
as ‘Notification’. In the CLI of Cisco
IOS, ‘Notification’ is used. Okay, let’s

227
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,800
go to question 2.

228
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:23,511
Here’s another one. What is the severity
level of the following Syslog message? Here

229
00:21:23,511 --> 00:21:32,360
are the options. Pause the video now to examine
the message and select the correct answer.

230
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:38,740
The answer is B, Error. That is the name of
severity level 3. Make sure you know all of

231
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,610
the severity levels and their names. They’re
mentioned in the exam topics list, so they’re

232
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:49,530
definitely important. Okay, let’s go to
question 3.

233
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:54,220
Which of the following locations are Syslog
messages sent to by default, without any specific

234
00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:00,320
Syslog configuration? (select two). Here are
the options. Pause the video now to think

235
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,000
about the answers, select two.

236
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,380
The answers are B, the console line and C,
the buffer. So, by default you will see Syslog

237
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,561
messages in realtime when connected to the
CLI of the device via the console port. You

238
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:22,020
can also use SHOW LOGGING to view those messages
stored in the logging buffer, in the memory

239
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:27,520
of the device. The device will not send Syslog
messages to an external server until you configure

240
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,730
it to do so, and Syslog messages also won’t
be displayed in the CLI while connecting to

241
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:39,560
the device via the VTY lines using Telnet
or SSH. I’ll cover Telnet and SSH in detail

242
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:47,000
in another video, don’t worry about them
for now. Okay, let’s go to question 4.

243
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,820
You issue the logging buffered 6 command on
R1. Syslog messages of which severity levels

244
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:57,680
will be saved to the logging buffer? Here
are the options. Pause the video to think

245
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:02,130
about the answer.

246
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:09,180
The answer is C, severity 0 to 6. When you
specify a level of log messages, all messages

247
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,640
of that level and higher severity, meaning
numerically lower because the lower numbers

248
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:19,230
are more severe, will be displayed or saved
to the buffer. Okay, let’s go to question

249
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,860
5.

250
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:26,980
Which of the following Syslog message fields
might not be displayed, depending on the device’s

251
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,300
configuration? (select two). Here are the
options. Pause the video to think about the

252
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,710
answers, select two.

253
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:44,810
The answers are A, sequence and D, time stamp.
You can configure these with the SERVICE TIMESTAMPS

254
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:50,710
and SERVICE SEQUENCE-NUMBERS command. I highly
recommend having timestamps on log messages,

255
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:55,030
although I don’t think sequence numbers
are as important. Okay, that’s all for the

256
00:23:55,030 --> 00:24:03,270
quiz. Now let’s take a look at a bonus question
in Boson Software’s ExSim for CCNA.

257
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:09,210
Okay here's today's Boson ExSim practice question.
So, this is a drag and drop simulator question,

258
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:14,651
so I'll click on this button to open it up.
And here it is. Select the Syslog message

259
00:24:14,651 --> 00:24:19,680
logging keywords from the left and drag them
to the corresponding Syslog levels on the

260
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,570
right. Okay, so I have said this multiple
times, but this is very important, that you

261
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:33,620
know all of these levels for the CCNA exam.
So pause the video now and try to do that.

262
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:40,470
Okay let's check. So, first level 0. This
is the most severe. So the number is lower

263
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:49,020
but the severity level is the highest. And
that is emergencies. Next one after that is

264
00:24:49,020 --> 00:25:00,440
number 1, alerts. And the critical, number
2. Errors, next level 4 is warnings. After

265
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:08,130
that, notifications, or notices. And then
level 6 is informational and level 7 is debugging.

266
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:14,030
So, if it helps you remember that, use the
mnemonic 'every awesome Cisco engineer will

267
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:19,350
need ice cream daily'. So, I personally don't
really use mnemonics but I know a lot of people

268
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:25,190
do, so if that helps you remember these seven
(*eight!) levels, you can use that one. Okay,

269
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:32,830
so I'll click on done and then let's check.
So the answer is correct, there it is. And

270
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:39,000
as always Boson has a great explanation down
here, detailing the levels, some information

271
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:49,320
about filtering the levels on the console,
to the server. And some other extra information.

272
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,990
There is also a reference here to some Cisco
documentation about the message logging level

273
00:25:54,990 --> 00:26:00,510
keywords. So, if you google this title here
you'll probably find it because this documentation

274
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:07,930
is available for free online from Cisco, and
it's another great study resource. Okay so

275
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:12,460
that was a question from Boson Software's
ExSim for CCNA. These are without a doubt

276
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:17,020
the best practice exams for the CCNA and I
highly recommend them. If you want to get
