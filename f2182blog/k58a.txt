lab we will configure the enhanced
interior gateway routing protocol 25.702227  e IG
RP 27.280019  e IG RP is as the name suggests an
enhanced version of Cisco's interior
gateway routing protocol IG RP 36.743248  although
EIGRP used to be a cisco proprietary
routing protocol meaning was available
only on cisco routers it has been moved
to an open standard 46.874269  however in a
multi-vendor environment you're almost
certainly going to see OSPF used over a
EIGRP  53.292539 let's get started  54.843747 the first step
is to configure loopback address on each
router 59.748768  these addresses will later become
the EIG RP router IDs used for each
router 65.373226  the eigrp router ID functions the
same way as the OSPF router ID 70.816955  manual
configuration takes priority 74.035955  if the
router ID is not manually configured the
highest IP address on a loopback
interface is used  80.852351 if there is no
loopback interface the highest IP
address on a regular interface is used 86.991268 
we've configured loopback to plenty of
times so let's go through this quickly 91.291914 
I'll start on r1  92.796976 enable coffee/tea
interface l0 IP address 1.1.11
255.255.255.0 v ok  107.903684 next are to 110.796684  enable
call T interface l0 IP address - 2 - 2
255.255.255.0 5 121.983496  ok next r3  124.494600 enable compte
interface l0
IP address 3.33 255.255.255.0 5  138.016204 next is
r4  140.481579 enable coffee tea interface l0 IP
address 4.4.4 255.255.255.0 5 153.502975  ok finally
let's go on our five  158.010121 enable coffee tea
interface l0 IP address v dot v dot v
dot v 255.255.255.0 v okay that's all
for step one  173.807767 now let's actually
configure a EIGRP on each router 177.571662  the
configuration is similar to OSPF
configuration  181.587579 let's go back to our one 183.598558 
to enter a EIGRP configuration mode use
this command 189.386599  router EA GRP followed by
the autonomous system or a s number  194.931683 in
this case we'll use 100  197.478828 well in OSPF the
process ID used in the router OSPF
command was only locally significant and
could be different on each router in the
network  207.441099 the EIG our pas number has to be
the same on each router in the network 212.352058 
if the a s number is different routers
will not become e IG RP neighbors 218.182953  keep
that in mind and definitely look out for
a s mismatches in any troubleshooting
problems on the test  224.548766 ok so from here we
use the network command just like OSPF 230.173224 
however VI GRP doesn't have the concept
of areas  234.479078 so we just need the IP address
and network mask 238.578015 
now the eigrp network command works the
same as the OSPF network command in that
it doesn't actually specify the networks
you are going to advertise 248.009203  it is used
only to identify which interfaces to
activate a eigrp on  253.795599 and then those
interfaces will advertise their
configured networks 257.558620  another feature of
the eigrp network command is that it
defaults to classful network boundaries
if you don't enter a mask  265.787202 so for example
our ones G 0 0 and F 1 0 interfaces both
fall within the class a 10.08 range 276.962223  so
I'll just type Network 1000 281.670702  and now
EIGRP will be activated on both
interfaces  286.009431 next I'll just enable it on
the loopback  289.563244 network 1.1.11
and this time let's enter the exact
wildcard mask 296.255765 
oh-oh-oh-oh 298.238577  now let's make the loopback
passive since we don't want to waste
resources sending advertisements on an
interface that isn't connected to any
other router 307.563619  this is exactly the same as
in OSPF  310.880160 passive interface l 0 314.105681  finally we
should disable auto summary Auto summary 318.077619 
can be on or off by default 321.630327 
I assume depending on either the OS
version or router model  325.709306 in packet tracer
and on these routers however it is
enabled by default 330.474701 
you should always turn it off any
summarization should be done manually
and only where intended  337.161055 no Auto summary
that's it 340.148680  ok let's continue on to r2 343.420700 
I'll go through these steps quickly for
the other routers 346.104742  router EAG RP 100 350.233221 
again make sure that a s number is
consistent throughout the network 354.287638 
network 10000 network to 2 to 200 200
passive interface l 0 no Auto summary 367.294659  ok
next let's go on R 3 369.814075 
router EAG RP 100 Network 10000 network
3 3 3 3 0 0 passive interface l 0 no
auto summary  388.320325 next r4 router EAG RP 100
Network 10000 network 4.4.4 dot 400 dead
Oh
passive interface L 0 no Auto summary 408.360450 
okay finally let's go to our 5  413.274180 router 
EAG RP 100  415.933409 Network 10000 network v dot v
dot v dot v oh oh oh oh passive
interface l 0 no auto summary 430.195638  okay
that's all 431.972784  let's go on our one and see
what routes it is learned  436.273159 do show IP
route 442.181950  the d beside these routes
indicates that they were learned via a
EIGRP 448.239388  notice the administrative distance
of 90 as opposed to OSPF s 110 454.683846  this
means if two routes are learned to a
destination 1 via EIGRP and one via OSPF
the eigrp route will be preferred  464.323221 also
notice these huge metric numbers 468.007554  OSPF
metric numbers were quite small and
simple to understand 473.417367 
however aig our P's metric numbers can
get quite large 476.903429  this is a small network
in our ones path to R 5 has a metric of
150 6672  485.562242 this is the path via our 4
because it has one gigabit ethernet link 490.348221 
well the Rev via r2 is all Fast Ethernet 493.311034 
however our next task is to configure
our one to perform unequal cost load
balancing when sending traffic to our
five 503.973804 
Oh SPF can only do equal cost load
balancing  507.854534 but II IG RP can do unequal
cost load balancing  511.203638 however it can't be
configured to do unequal cost load
balancing over just any path 518.009242  it has to
meet a certain requirement  519.993117 let's look
further  521.814471 do show IP e IG RP topology 526.815617  this
command shows the successor routes
meaning the best routes to each
destination  533.254179 as well as the feasible
successor routes  536.755575 meaning routes that
weren't picked as the successor 539.614471  but meet
that certain requirement  541.508846 and will also
serve as backups in the case the
successor route goes down  545.768575 if you don't
understand the EIG RP concepts of
successor and feasible successor  552.673929 as well
as feasible distance and reported or
advertised distance  557.266658 make sure you learn
them in whatever video course or book
you are using 561.520971  they can be a little
difficult to understand at first and I'm
not going to explain them here 566.016846 
so in this a I gr p topology table  569.644532 these
numbers on the Left indicate the
feasible distance to a destination 574.287719  and
the numbers on the right indicate the
reported distance  578.956219 remember in order for
a route to be a feasible successor  583.245323 it's
reported distance must be lower than the
successors feasible distance 588.247927  routes
which don't meet this criteria will not
show up in this table  593.589219 however do show IP
eigrp topology all links will display
them 602.553990  in this network however there
aren't any such routes 606.070323 
okay so our one has a successor route to
our five via 10.14 o4 which is our four 615.525073 
with a metric of 150 6672 620.320802  it also has a
feasible successor route via 10.12
o2 which is r2 with a metric of one
hundred fifty eight thousand nine
hundred seventy six 631.626260  to enable r1 to load
balance over these use the
variance command  638.002323 then we enter a
multiplier for example variance to will
allow r1 to load balance over feasible
successor routes that have up to double
the feasible distance of the successor
rep  652.054718 or triple the distance if we used
variance three  656.099052 the difference between
these two metrics is fairly small so in
this case we can just use variance to 663.124343 
that's it
do show IP route 668.129885  now you can see both
paths are in the routing table 672.741531  both for
the v dot v dot v dot v loopback address
and the 10.35 0 network 679.584614  let me just
emphasize one point  682.478552 e IG RP will never
load balance over paths which aren't
feasible successors  688.080531 you can set the
maximum variance 128  692.470926 but if the other
pads aren't feasible successors ew g RP
won't load balance over them  698.021447 this is an
important feature to prevent routing
loops 701.417593  okay our last task is to configure
r3 to advertise a 1000 / 8 summary
network to r5  711.604343 manual summarization is
actually not in the exam topics for
icnd2  717.855383 however i included it in my oh s
PF labs and will hear in my ear g RP
labs 724.132321  simply for the reason that it is
often included in other CCNA learning
materials 729.338988 
Cisco's exam topics don't necessarily
list everything that is on the exam 734.919279  so
summarization may actually be something
you should know for the exam 738.551633  and in
either case it's just a single command
so let's try it out on r3 744.248904  to configure a
summary route in AI GRP we configure it
at the interface level 751.735383  unlike in OSPF
where we configure that oh s PF
configuration mode 756.577758  in this case we'll
configure it on the g00 interface  761.589842 the
one facing our v  763.185592 interface g 0 0 766.061717 
this is the command IP summary address
eh ERP followed by the a s number 100
then the network address 10000 followed
by the mask 781.923071  much like with OSPF
summarization ew GRP summarization uses
a normal network mask not a wildcard
mask 791.185508 
unlike the network command which does
use a wildcard mask 794.970821  so in this case 255
0 0 0 799.335196 
ok that's all there is to it  802.511883 let's check
it out on our 5 804.677299  do show IP route 811.643195  there
it is our 5 has now learned at 1000 / 8
summary address instead of all of those
separate networks 819.833195  in this slob we did a
basic AIG RP configuration with unequal
cost load balancing and some manual
summarization  828.776987 that's all for this lab 830.728237
