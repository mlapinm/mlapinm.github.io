lab we will configure the enhanced

interior gateway routing protocol e IG

RP e IG RP is as the name suggests an

enhanced version of Cisco's interior

gateway routing protocol IG RP although

EIGRP used to be a cisco proprietary

routing protocol meaning was available

only on cisco routers it has been moved

to an open standard however in a

multi-vendor environment you're almost

certainly going to see OSPF used over a

EIGRP let's get started the first step

is to configure loopback address on each

router these addresses will later become

the EIG RP router IDs used for each

router the eigrp router ID functions the

same way as the OSPF router ID manual

configuration takes priority if the

router ID is not manually configured the

highest IP address on a loopback

interface is used if there is no

loopback interface the highest IP

address on a regular interface is used

we've configured loopback to plenty of

times so let's go through this quickly

I'll start on r1 enable coffee/tea

interface l0 IP address 1.1.11

255.255.255.0 v ok next are to enable

call T interface l0 IP address - 2 - 2

255.255.255.0 5 ok next r3 enable compte

interface l0

IP address 3.33 255.255.255.0 5 next is

r4 enable coffee tea interface l0 IP

address 4.4.4 255.255.255.0 5 ok finally

let's go on our five enable coffee tea

interface l0 IP address v dot v dot v

dot v 255.255.255.0 v okay that's all

for step one now let's actually

configure a EIGRP on each router the

configuration is similar to OSPF

configuration let's go back to our one

to enter a EIGRP configuration mode use

this command router EA GRP followed by

the autonomous system or a s number in

this case we'll use 100 well in OSPF the

process ID used in the router OSPF

command was only locally significant and

could be different on each router in the

network the EIG our pas number has to be

the same on each router in the network

if the a s number is different routers

will not become e IG RP neighbors keep

that in mind and definitely look out for

a s mismatches in any troubleshooting

problems on the test ok so from here we

use the network command just like OSPF

however VI GRP doesn't have the concept

of areas so we just need the IP address

and network mask

now the eigrp network command works the

same as the OSPF network command in that

it doesn't actually specify the networks

you are going to advertise it is used

only to identify which interfaces to

activate a eigrp on and then those

interfaces will advertise their

configured networks another feature of

the eigrp network command is that it

defaults to classful network boundaries

if you don't enter a mask so for example

our ones G 0 0 and F 1 0 interfaces both

fall within the class a 10.08 range so

I'll just type Network 1000 and now

EIGRP will be activated on both

interfaces next I'll just enable it on

the loopback network 1.1.11

and this time let's enter the exact

wildcard mask

oh-oh-oh-oh now let's make the loopback

passive since we don't want to waste

resources sending advertisements on an

interface that isn't connected to any

other router this is exactly the same as

in OSPF passive interface l 0 finally we

should disable auto summary Auto summary

can be on or off by default

I assume depending on either the OS

version or router model in packet tracer

and on these routers however it is

enabled by default

you should always turn it off any

summarization should be done manually

and only where intended no Auto summary

that's it ok let's continue on to r2

I'll go through these steps quickly for

the other routers router EAG RP 100

again make sure that a s number is

consistent throughout the network

network 10000 network to 2 to 200 200

passive interface l 0 no Auto summary ok

next let's go on R 3

router EAG RP 100 Network 10000 network

3 3 3 3 0 0 passive interface l 0 no

auto summary next r4 router EAG RP 100

Network 10000 network 4.4.4 dot 400 dead

Oh

passive interface L 0 no Auto summary

okay finally let's go to our 5 router

EAG RP 100 Network 10000 network v dot v

dot v dot v oh oh oh oh passive

interface l 0 no auto summary okay

that's all let's go on our one and see

what routes it is learned do show IP

route the d beside these routes

indicates that they were learned via a

EIGRP notice the administrative distance

of 90 as opposed to OSPF s 110 this

means if two routes are learned to a

destination 1 via EIGRP and one via OSPF

the eigrp route will be preferred also

notice these huge metric numbers OSPF

metric numbers were quite small and

simple to understand

however aig our P's metric numbers can

get quite large this is a small network

in our ones path to R 5 has a metric of

150 6672 this is the path via our 4

because it has one gigabit ethernet link

well the Rev via r2 is all Fast Ethernet

however our next task is to configure

our one to perform unequal cost load

balancing when sending traffic to our

five

Oh SPF can only do equal cost load

balancing but II IG RP can do unequal

cost load balancing however it can't be

configured to do unequal cost load

balancing over just any path it has to

meet a certain requirement let's look

further do show IP e IG RP topology this

command shows the successor routes

meaning the best routes to each

destination as well as the feasible

successor routes meaning routes that

weren't picked as the successor but meet

that certain requirement and will also

serve as backups in the case the

successor route goes down if you don't

understand the EIG RP concepts of

successor and feasible successor as well

as feasible distance and reported or

advertised distance make sure you learn

them in whatever video course or book

you are using they can be a little

difficult to understand at first and I'm

not going to explain them here

so in this a I gr p topology table these

numbers on the Left indicate the

feasible distance to a destination and

the numbers on the right indicate the

reported distance remember in order for

a route to be a feasible successor it's

reported distance must be lower than the

successors feasible distance routes

which don't meet this criteria will not

show up in this table however do show IP

eigrp topology all links will display

them in this network however there

aren't any such routes

okay so our one has a successor route to

our five via 10.14 o4 which is our four

with a metric of 150 6672 it also has a

feasible successor route via 10.12

o2 which is r2 with a metric of one

hundred fifty eight thousand nine

hundred seventy six to enable r1 to load

balance over these use the

variance command then we enter a

multiplier for example variance to will

allow r1 to load balance over feasible

successor routes that have up to double

the feasible distance of the successor

rep or triple the distance if we used

variance three the difference between

these two metrics is fairly small so in

this case we can just use variance to

that's it

do show IP route now you can see both

paths are in the routing table both for

the v dot v dot v dot v loopback address

and the 10.35 0 network let me just

emphasize one point e IG RP will never

load balance over paths which aren't

feasible successors you can set the

maximum variance 128 but if the other

pads aren't feasible successors ew g RP

won't load balance over them this is an

important feature to prevent routing

loops okay our last task is to configure

r3 to advertise a 1000 / 8 summary

network to r5 manual summarization is

actually not in the exam topics for

icnd2 however i included it in my oh s

PF labs and will hear in my ear g RP

labs simply for the reason that it is

often included in other CCNA learning

materials

Cisco's exam topics don't necessarily

list everything that is on the exam so

summarization may actually be something

you should know for the exam and in

either case it's just a single command

so let's try it out on r3 to configure a

summary route in AI GRP we configure it

at the interface level unlike in OSPF

where we configure that oh s PF

configuration mode in this case we'll

configure it on the g00 interface the

one facing our v interface g 0 0

this is the command IP summary address

eh ERP followed by the a s number 100

then the network address 10000 followed

by the mask much like with OSPF

summarization ew GRP summarization uses

a normal network mask not a wildcard

mask

unlike the network command which does

use a wildcard mask so in this case 255

0 0 0

ok that's all there is to it let's check

it out on our 5 do show IP route there

it is our 5 has now learned at 1000 / 8

summary address instead of all of those

separate networks in this slob we did a

basic AIG RP configuration with unequal

cost load balancing and some manual

summarization that's all for this lab
