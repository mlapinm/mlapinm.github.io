welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab you can download the lab

file from the link in the description if

you like these labs please consider

supporting me via my patreon or the

cryptocurrency options in the

description this will be a short lab

focused on using telnet to connect to

Cisco devices in a previous lab we

configured the console port and use that

to connect to a router via PC in this

lab we will use telnet which allows us

to configure a Cisco device by

connecting via a regular Ethernet port

note that although telnet is something

you should be familiar with it is not

something you will likely end up using

due to a lack of security this is

because telnet sends all data in

plaintext if anyone intercepts that data

they can read it including usernames and

passwords and other sensitive data

instead of telnet you will want to use

SSH which we will cover in another lab

but with that said telnet is still

something you should know

so let's practice some of the basics in

this lab as always try to complete the

lab yourself first then continue

watching this video if you have trouble

or watch it after to check your solution

if you haven't learned the commands

required to do these tasks yet in your

studies feel free to just watch the

video to learn them

step one is to configure the IP

addresses on switch 1 and R 1 we will

then use these addresses to connect to

the devices later in the lab let's go on

switch 1 first enable compte we will

configure the IP address on the VLAN 1

interface because a regular switch

interface cannot be configured with an

IP address we have to configure that IP

address we use to manage the device on a

VLAN interface rather than on a physical

interface so interface VLAN 1 IP address

192.168.1.1 5 5 dot 255 dot 255 0 also

I'll use no shutdown to activate it now

let's configure r1 enable COFF T

interface G 0 0 IP address 192.168.1.1

255.255.255.0 remember router interfaces

are administratively down by default so

no shutdown okay that's all for step 1

step 2 is to configure a single user on

each device since we're on our one let's

do that first

exit username cisco password CCNA note

again that passwords are case sensitive

and in this case CCNA is in all capitals

now let's do the same on switch one exit

username cisco password CCNA

step three is to configure the vty lines

on switch 1 and R 1 vqi stands for

virtual teletype and when you create a

telnet connection to a Cisco device you

will be connecting to one of these vty

lines there are typically 16 numbered 0

through 15 although in the running

configuration they will typically be

displayed as 0 through 4 then 5 through

15 let's check on switch 1 do show run

scroll down to the bottom there we go

line vty 0 4 meaning line 0 through 4

then line vty 5 15 meaning alliance 5

through 15 although it is displayed like

this in the configuration we can simply

use the command line vty 0 15 to connect

to all lines from 0 through 15 there we

go now we have two things to configure

here according to the lab instructions

first require the use of the local user

database to connect to the vty lines

this is the same command we used when

configuring the console line in a

previous lab login local since we only

have one user in the local database we

will have to use the username cisco and

password CCNA when we try to tell that

to this device later the next

requirement is to allow only telnet

connections to the vty lines this is

done with this command transport input

now I'll use the question mark to see

what options there are all none SSH and

telnet

as I mentioned in the beginning of the

video typically you'll be using SSH but

let's set it to telnet for this lab ok

now let's do the same configuration on

our one line vty 0 15 login local

transport input telnet

okay now let's type do show run look at

the bottom here there it is our

configurations have been applied to all

vty lines step four is to attempt to

telnet to each device from pc1 on a

simulator like packet tracer you simply

click on the icons of each device to

configure them in real situations

however you have to connect to the

devices from a computer via the console

port as we did in a previous lab or by

telnet or SSH as we're going to try now

I'll go on PC one let's try switch one

telnet 192.168.1.2 we're asked for the

username which is Cisco and our password

CCNA in all caps there we go now we have

access to the command line of switch one

I'll type exit and now let's try our one

telnet 192.168.1.1 cisco CCNA there we

go now we have access to the command

line of r1 that's all for this lab
