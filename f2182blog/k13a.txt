welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab you can download the lab

file from the link in the description in

this lab we will take a basic look at

CDP cisco discovery protocol CDP is a

cisco proprietary protocol it is used to

share information about other directly

connected cisco equipment such as the

operating system version and the

interfaces by which they are connected

there is also a vendor-neutral protocol

called lldp or link layer discovery

protocol which I will talk about in

another video try to complete the lab

yourself first then continue watching

this video if you have trouble or watch

it after to check your solution step 1

is to use CDP to identify which

interfaces are used to connect the

routers and switches CDP can only

display directly connected neighbors so

switch one should have one neighbor r1

r1 should have two neighbors switch 1

and r2 r2 should have two neighbors r1

and switch two and switch two should

have one neighbor r2 let's check on

switch 1 first enable now let's use the

command show CDP neighbors as you can

see switch 1 has one neighbor r1 it is

connected to the fastethernet 0/1

interface remember local interface means

the interface on this device switch 1

under capability there is an R and if

you check the capability codes list up

here you can see that that means router

also check the pork ID this is the

interface of the remote device in this

case r1 so now you know switch 1 is

connected to r1 by its fastethernet 0/1

interface and it's connected to our ones

fastethernet 0/0 interface let's hop on

r1 now

enable show CDP neighbors are one has

two neighbors switch 1 and r2

it's connected to switch 1 via the

fastethernet 0/0 interface which we

already learned from switch 1 it's

connected to r2 by its serial to zero

interface and it's connected to our

two's serial to zero interface as well

let's do the same on art to enable show

CDP neighbors as we already saw in our

one the two routers are connected by

their serial to zero interfaces also r2

is connected by its fastethernet 0/0

interface to switch twos fastethernet

0/1 interface finally let's go on switch

to enable show CDP neighbors as we

already saw switch to is connected via

its fastethernet 0/1 interface to our

two's fastethernet 0/0 interface that's

all for step one

step two is to determine which side of

the connection between r1 and r2 is DCE

and which is DTE I mentioned in a

previous lab that serial connections

have a DC e or data communications

equipment side and a DTE or data

terminal equipment side remember that

the important difference is that the DCE

side has to provide the clock rate of

the connection we don't use CDP for this

it's just a bit of review let's go on r1

show controllers s20 remember that the

routers are connected by their serial to

zero interfaces as you can see our one

is in fact the DCE side of the

connection now let's set the clock rate

to 64 kilobits per second compte

interface s20 clock rate 64,000 that's

it step 3 asks us what the default CDP

send and hold timers are and to confirm

it with a show command you may have

learned these timers in your studies but

let's check on a device to make sure

I'll type end to go back to privileged

exec mode here on r1 now let's use the

command show CDP interface this gives us

information about all interfaces their

status whether CDP is activated on them

or not and their send and hold times all

of these interfaces have the default

setting and as you can see that is a

sent time of 60 seconds and the whole

time of 180 seconds so CDP

advertisements will be sent out of each

interface that is up once every 60

seconds also if r1 doesn't receive an

advertisement on a particular interface

within 180 seconds it will assume that

whatever neighbor that was there no

longer is that's all for step 3

step four says to disable CDP globally

on r1 and attempt to view CDP neighbors

so let's go into global configuration

mode conf the command to enable CDP is

CDP run although it's enabled by default

we want to disable it and that is done

with no CDP run now let's check CDP

neighbors do show CDP neighbor we get a

message indicating that CDP is not

enabled our one won't send any

advertisements and will ignore any it

receives step 5 is to enable CDP

globally again on r1 and immediately

view the CDP neighbours CDP run do show

CDP neighbors we re enabled CDP but no

neighbors appear why is that well

because the CDP sent time is 60 seconds

by default it can take a bit for our

neighbors to appear again if we were to

wait a minute and enter the command

again they would appear

step six is to disable CDP on the switch

interfaces connected to pcs because CDP

sends information about the device for

security purposes it is a good idea to

disable it where it isn't needed 2 pcs

are connected to each switch so let's go

on switch one first compte now we don't

want to disable CDP globally so we won't

use no CDP run we want to only disable

it on Fast Ethernet 0 3 and 0 4 we have

to use interface configuration mode for

this since we'll be using the same

command on each interface let's

configure both at the same time you can

do this by configuring an interface

range you can enter interface range

configuration mode for Fast Ethernet 0 3

and 0 4 with this command interface

range f03 space - space for as you can

see we are now in interface range

configuration mode this is very

convenient when you are doing the same

configurations on multiple interfaces

now CDP and naval is used to enable CDP

on an interface but it is enabled by

default to disable you once again use no

in front of the command no CDP enable ok

that's it now let's go to switch to and

do the same thing comte interface range

of 0 3 to 4 no CDP enable that's all for
