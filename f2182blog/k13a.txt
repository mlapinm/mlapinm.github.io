in this lab we will take a basic look at CDP cisco discovery protocol
14.533292
CDP is a cisco proprietary protocol
18.473101
it is used to share information about other directly connected cisco equipment such as the operating system version and the interfaces by which they are connected
28.24391
there is also a vendor-neutral protocol called lldp or link layer discovery protocol
35.034259
which I will talk about in another video
37.721952
try to complete the lab yourself first then continue watching this video if you have trouble or watch it after to check your solution
45.806908
step 1 is to use CDP to identify which interfaces are used to connect the routers and switches
54.209562
CDP can only display directly connected neighbors so switch one should have one neighbor r1
60.939856
r1 should have two neighbors switch 1 and r2
65.231943
r2 should have two neighbors r1 and switch two
69.394916
and switch two should have one neighbor r2
72.662789
let's check on switch 1 first
75.808923
enable now let's use the command show CDP neighbors
83.824937
as you can see switch 1 has one neighbor r1
88.542371
it is connected to the fastethernet 0/1 interface
92.451745
remember local interface means the interface on this device switch 1
99.005865
under capability there is an R and if you check the capability codes list up here
105.441897
you can see that that means router
107.75254
also check the port ID
111.449542
this is the interface of the remote device in this case r1
116.046399
so now you know switch 1 is connected to r1 by its fastethernet 0/1 interface
123.046494
and it's connected to our ones fastethernet 0/0 interface
126.749828
let's hop on r1 now
131.6662
enable show CDP neighbors are one has two neighbors switch 1 and r2
143.569504
it's connected to switch 1 via the fastethernet 0/0 interface which we already learned from switch 1
149.813736
it's connected to r2 by its serial to zero interface
154.883615
and it's connected to our two's serial to zero interface as well
159.030221
let's do the same on r2
161.775451
enable show CDP neighbors
168.08063
as we already saw in r1 the two routers are connected by their serial to zero interfaces
175.883445
also r2 is connected by its fastethernet 0/0 interface 2 switch twos fastethernet 0/1 interface
182.424757
finally let's go on switch 2
186.428288
enable show CDP neighbors
192.782344
as we already saw switch to is connected via its fastethernet 0/1 interface to our two's fastethernet 0/0 interface
201.604715
that's all for step one
203.366253
step two is to determine which side of the connection between r1 and r2 is DCE and which is DTE
214.941147
I mentioned in a previous lab that serial connections have a DC e or data communications equipment side and a DTE or data terminal equipment side
224.943752
remember that the important difference is that the DCE side has to provide the clock rate of the connection
232.519096
we don't use CDP for this it's just a bit of review
236.197083
let's go on r1
238.430008
show controllers s20
243.828895
remember that the routers are connected by their serial to zero interfaces
248.212418
as you can see our one is in fact the DCE side of the connection
253.824031
now let's set the clock rate to 64 kilobits per second
257.775156
conf t interface s20 clock rate 64,000
267.36257
that's it
269.153449
step 3 asks us what the default CDP send and hold timers are and to confirm it with a show command
277.03029
you may have learned these timers in your studies
280.293589
but let's check on a device to make sure
282.535432
I'll type end to go back to privileged exec mode here on r1
287.54017
now let's use the command show CDP interface
291.558112
this gives us information about all interfaces
295.397115
their status whether CDP is activated on them or not and their send and hold times
301.859193
all of these interfaces have the default setting
305.539419
and as you can see that is a sent time of 60 seconds and the whole time of 180 seconds
311.408525
so CDP advertisements will be sent out of each interface that is up once every 60 seconds
318.901308
also if r1 doesn't receive an advertisement on a particular interface within 180 seconds
325.490652
it will assume that whatever neighbor that was there no longer is
330.01255
that's all for step 3
331.705954
step four says to disable CDP globally on r1 and attempt to view CDP neighbors
340.353734
so let's go into global configuration mode
343.170126
conf t command to enable CDP is CDP run although it's enabled by default
350.87197
we want to disable it
353.280684
and that is done with no CDP run
356.091106
now let's check CDP neighbors
359.484814
do show CDP neighbor
362.032107
we get a message indicating that CDP is not enabled
366.081287
our one won't send any advertisements and will ignore any it receives
371.095981
step 5 is to enable CDP globally again on r1 and immediately view the CDP neighbours
379.799855
CDP run do show CDP neighbors
386.232826
we re enabled CDP but no neighbors appear
390.411636
why is that
392.544525
well because the CDP sent time is 60 seconds by default
396.745334
it can take a bit for our neighbors to appear again
400.125802
if we were to wait a minute and enter the command again they would appear
404.241241
step six is to disable CDP on the switch interfaces connected to pcs
413.451594
because CDP sends information about the device for security purposes it is a good idea to disable it where it isn't needed
422.390284
2 pcs are connected to each switch
426.042409
so let's go on switch one first
428.434766
conf t now we don't want to disable CDP globally so we won't use no CDP run
439.431376
we want to only disable it on Fast Ethernet 0 3 and 0 4
445.173976
we have to use interface configuration mode for this
447.63276
since we'll be using the same command on each interface
451.93034
let's configure both at the same time
454.426694
you can do this by configuring an interface range
458.419224
you can enter interface range configuration mode for Fast Ethernet 0 3 and 0 4 with this command
465.688898
interface range f03 space - space for
472.114888
as you can see we are now in interface range configuration mode
476.659967
this is very convenient when you are doing the same configurations on multiple interfaces
481.83431
now CDP and naval is used to enable CDP on an interface
487.877268
but it is enabled by default
489.854752
to disable you once again use no in front of the command
494.424118
no CDP enable
497.088948
ok that's it
498.506033
now let's go to switch to and do the same thing
502.003118
conf t interface range of 0 3 to 4
510.394603
no CDP enable
512.751444
that's all for this lab
