6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,360
Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,690
Also, remember to download this practice lab
from the link in the description and try it

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,100
out yourself in packet tracer.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:31,170
In this lab we will practice some basic VLAN
configurations, specifically configuring access

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,010
ports on a Cisco switch, which is what was
covered in day 16’s lecture video.

11
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,901
As I said in that video, an access port belongs
to a single VLAN, and a switch won’t forward

12
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:47,220
frames between VLANs directly, it must send
it to a router first.

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,660
This network here is very much like the one
I used for the demonstration in the lecture

14
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,300
video, featuring three VLANs.

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:01:01,100
VLAN10, the engineering department, VLAN20,
the HR department, and VLAN30, the sales department.

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,500
Let’s get started with step 1.

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,701
First up, we must configure the correct IP
address and subnet mask on each PC, and we

18
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:15,380
must set the gateway address as the last usable
address of the subnet.

19
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,240
We will later configure that address on R1,
as it will be the default gateway for each

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,240
subnet.

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:30,119
So, let’s go on PC1 first.  From the config
tab, let’s enter the gateway address first.

22
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,240
The last usable address for PC1’s subnet
is 10.0.0.62, so that will be the default

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,340
gateway of the subnet, R1’s address.

24
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:48,340
Next, click on the network interface here, and
set the IP address of 10.0.0.1, hit tab, and

25
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:55,900
then adjust the subnet mask to 255.255.255.192,
because it’s a /26 subnet.

26
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,450
Okay, that’s all for PC1.

27
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,220
I’ll quickly run through the other PCs now.

28
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:13,840
PC2 is next.  Go to the config tab, gateway
address of 10.0.0.62.  Go to the network interface,

29
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:21,960
IP address of 10.0.0.2, and subnet mask of
255.255.255.192.

30
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:32,520
Okay, that’s all for the VLAN10 PCs, next
VLAN20.  So, I’ll go on PC3.  Config.

31
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:38,650
Set the gateway address of 10.0.0.126, the
last usable address of the subnet.

32
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:50,100
Then, configure the network interface, address
of 10.0.0.65, subnet mask 255.255.255.192.

33
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:59,560
Okay, now let’s go to PC4.  Config, gateway
address of 10.0.0.126, then let’s configure

34
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:09,880
fastethernet0.  IP address of 10.0.0.66, subnet
mask of 255.255.255.192.

35
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,060
Okay, those are the PCs in VLAN20.

36
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:21,540
Finally, let’s configure PC5 and PC6 in
VLAN30.  PC5 first.

37
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:29,860
In the config tab, set the gateway address to 10.0.0.190,
which is the last usable address of the subnet.

38
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:41,440
Then, set PC5’s IP address to 10.0.0.129,
and subnet mask of 255.255.255.192.

39
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:55,140
Okay, finally let’s go on PC6.  Set the gateway address
of 10.0.0.190, and PC6’s IP address is 10.0.0.130,

40
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:02,300
and the subnet mask is once again 255.255.255.192, or
/26.

41
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:08,820
Okay, so we’ve configured all of the PCs,
that’s step 1 complete.

42
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:15,000
Step 2 is to make three connections between
R1 and SW1, and configure one interface on

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,690
R1 for each VLAN.

44
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:22,610
So, I’ll click down here for the connections,
and select a straight through cable.

45
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:31,460
I’ve already put the interface labels on
the network diagram, SW1’s G0/1 to R1 G0/0, etc.

46
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,660
So, let’s do that.

47
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:51,600
SW1 G0/1 to R1 G0/0.  Next is SW1 G1/1 to R1 G0/1.  And
then SW1 G2/1 to R1 G0/2.

48
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:59,780
Okay, we’ve made three connections, now
let’s configure R1.  Hop on to the CLI,

49
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:02,740
and then enter privileged exec mode with ENABLE.

50
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,689
And then, global config mode with CONFIGURE TERMINAL.

51
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:16,800
Okay, I’ll configure G0/0 for VLAN10, G0/1
for VLAN20, and G0/2 for VLAN30.

52
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,639
So, INTERFACE G0/0.

53
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,919
We must assign the same IP addresses that
we configured as the gateway addresses for

54
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:25,919
each PC.

55
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:36,640
Here in VLAN10, that is IP ADDRESS 10.0.0.62
255.255.255.192.

56
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,880
Then, enable the interface with NO SHUTDOWN.

57
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:44,500
Okay, next up G0/1.

58
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,539
INTERFACE G0/1.

59
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:59,089
The gateway address for VLAN20 is IP ADDRESS
10.0.0.126 255.255.255.192.

60
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:00,699
NO SHUTDOWN.

61
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,480
Okay, now G0/2.

62
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,500
INTERFACE G0/2.

63
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:17,220
The gateway address for VLAN30 is IP ADDRESS
10.0.0.190 255.255.255.192.

64
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,320
NO SHUTDOWN.

65
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,819
Okay, let’s confirm with a quick show command.

66
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:26,530
DO SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.

67
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:32,479
There are the three gateway address we configured
for each VLAN, looks good.

68
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,839
For step 3, let’s configure SW1’s interfaces.

69
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:45,240
Go on to the CLI of SW1. 
 ENABLE.  And then CONFIGURE
TERMINAL.

70
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,580
Okay, now let’s configure the three VLAN10
interfaces at once like this: INTERFACE RANGE

71
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:59,719
G0/1 COMMA F3/1 COMMA F4/1.

72
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,939
Now we are configuring all three interfaces
at once.

73
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:10,660
Let’s configure the interfaces as access
ports with this command: SWITCHPORT MODE ACCESS

74
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,360
It should enter that mode by default, but
it’s best to manually configure it.

75
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,779
Remember, an access port belongs to a single
VLAN, as opposed to trunk ports which we will

76
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:23,599
cover in Day 17’s lecture video.

77
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:29,319
Next, let’s assign the VLAN, SWITCHPORT
ACCESS VLAN 10.

78
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,050
Okay, that’s it.

79
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,490
Let’s go on to VLAN20.

80
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:42,240
INTERFACE RANGE G1/1 COMMA F5/1 COMMA F6/1.

81
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,900
SWITCHPORT MODE ACCESS.

82
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,999
SWITCHPORT ACCESS VLAN 20.

83
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,800
Okay, finally let’s do VLAN30.

84
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:59,120
INTERFACE RANGE G2/1 COMMA F7/1 COMMA F8/1.

85
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,600
SWITCHPORT MODE ACCESS.

86
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,300
SWITCHPORT ACCESS VLAN 30.

87
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,509
Let’s check it out.

88
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:13,719
DO SHOW VLAN BRIEF.  Okay, our VLANs were
created and the interfaces were assigned to

89
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:14,889
the correct VLANs.

90
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:18,819
But, let’s also change the VLAN names now.

91
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:21,179
VLAN 10.

92
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:23,219
NAME ENGINEERING.

93
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:26,680
VLAN 20.

94
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,169
NAME HR.

95
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:30,809
VLAN 30.

96
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:33,099
NAME SALES.

97
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:35,500
And let’s check once more.

98
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,240
DO SHOW VLAN BRIEF.

99
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,810
Okay, the names have been changed.

100
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,990
That’s all for step 3.

101
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:52,120
Finally let’s test connectivity, I’ll
do some pings from PC1.  Okay, go on to the CLI

102
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,519
of PC1, and first I’ll ping to complete
the ARP process.

103
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,160
Let’s ping to PC3, in VLAN 20

104
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:16,569
PING 10.0.0.65.  Okay, so we
can reach PC3.

105
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:20,310
Next, let's ping PC5 in VLAN 30.

106
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:34,060
PING 10.0.0.129.  Okay, we
can reach PC5 as well.

107
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:45,560
Now let’s go in simulation mode, and 
ping PC3 again.  Okay, let's do that ping. 
 PING 10.0.0.65.

108
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:55,410
Okay, so PC1 sends the ping to SW1, then it
goes to R1, then back to SW1, then to PC3,

109
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,339
and the return follows the same path.

110
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:03,670
So, R1 is doing the inter-vlan routing for
us because it has one interface in each VLAN.

111
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,779
Okay, let’s do one more test.

112
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:14,510
I’ll ping VLAN10’s broadcast IP, which is 10.0.0.63,
and let’s see if the broadcast only goes

113
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,350
to devices in VLAN10, as it should.

114
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,150
Let’s try.

115
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,920
PING 10.0.0.63.

116
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:30,379
Okay, there we go, it is sent to SW1, which
then forwards it only to R1 and PC2.

117
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:36,110
Okay, in this lab we did basic configuration
of access ports on a Cisco switch.

118
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:40,149
That’s all for this lab.

119
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:41,720
