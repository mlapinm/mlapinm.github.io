Welcome to Jeremy’s IT Lab.
2.995719
This is a free, complete course for the CCNA 200-301.
7.710098
In this video I will show you how to download and get started with Cisco’s network simulation
software, packet tracer.
14.876124
Packet tracer is a great tool to get hands on experience in Cisco’s command-line interface
to configure routers and switches.
24.29316
This video, however, will just be a basic exercise to get you familiar with the software,
30.731758
since we haven’t learned any actual configurations yet in the course.
34.259706
Let’s get started.
35.75638
This is webpage is part of Cisco’s networking academy.
40.328426
To download packet tracer, you have to enroll in their introduction to packet tracer course,
46.345906
although you dont actually have to do the course.
49.277103
I’ve never checked it out, but maybe give it a look if you have the time.
53.987096
You’ll need a networking academy account to download as well as log in to packet tracer
to use it.
60.192099
Don’t worry, it’s all free.
62.675005
So click enroll to download packet tracer and go through the steps.
67.054058
Then, click the link in the description of this video to download the packet tracer file
for this video, and open the file.
76.045366
You’re greeted with a lonely Internet cloud, and some instructions.
81.751752
Since this is the first lab and I’m guessing some of you have never touched packet tracer,
86.635857
the task for this lab is simply to recreate the network diagram displayed at 16 minutes
and 40 seconds into the Day 1 video.
94.231192
Let’s take a look at that.
96.403021
So, there is one network on the left side, and one on the right, 
102.641875
both connected to the Internet,
as well as an attacker somewhere else on the Internet.
107.114279
This is a pretty simple topology so I’ve got it memorized, feel free to switch between
windows to confirm which devices go where as you make the diagram.
117.68647
First, I’ll place the routers.
120.561076
In packet, tracer, you can choose network devices and end devices, or end hosts, in
the bottom left.
128.550511
Under network devices, then routers, select the 2911 router.
135.831612
Drag to place one here for the New York LAN, and one here for the Tokyo LAN.
142.109795
Next, I’ll place the firewalls.
144.819057
Again, under network devices, this time go to security, select the 5500 firewall, then
drag to place them.
155.026965
New york’s firewall is outside of the router, and Tokyo’s is inside.
160.029379
Next, let’s place the switches.
163.857255
Under network devices, select switches, choose the 2960 switch, and place one in each LAN.
172.540226
Okay, now we can place the end hosts, our PCs and servers.
177.634445
Select end devices this time, 
181.992717
and here under end devices are the end hosts we need.
185.372784
Place two PCs in the New York LAN...and then two servers in the Tokyo LAN...
193.58936
now finally,
we can place the attacker.
197.85478
We’re told in the lab instructions to use a laptop as the attacker in the diagram.
202.590101
Down here between PC and server is laptop, so select it and place it here.
208.993123
Now let’s fix these names on the diagram to match the ones in the video.
215.481259
Double click on the device names, and then you can enter a different name.
220.735408
Pc1’s here already, so PC2...SW1...R1...FW1...Attacker...R2...FW2...SW2...SRV1...and finally SRV2.
249.059005
There we go.
250.456082
Now, that’s not part of the lab instructions, but its good to know how to change the host
names on the diagram.
255.893877
Okay, now there’s only one problem.
259.562539
None of these devices are connected together!
262.035842
We haven’t studied about different connection and cable types yet in the course, 
267.132759
so for
this video let’s use a convenient feature of packet tracer.
271.257824
Click this lightning bolt for connections, and then the lightning bolt again here.
278.144245
If you look closely at the bottom it says ‘automatically choose connetion type’.
283.205091
So I’ll use this and quickly connect all of the devices.
286.879963
Pc1 to SW1...PC2 to SW1 SW1...SW1 to R1...R1 to FW1..FW1 to the Internet.
302.126178

Attacker to the Internet.
304.100647
R2 to the Internet….R2 to FW2...FW2 to SW2..SRV1 to SW2..and finally SRV2 to SW2.
319.340891
Okay, that’s all there is to this week’s lab.
323.605916
Soon enough we’ll get into actual configurations and make this network, work!
328.888841
Of course, feel free to look into Cisco’s introduction to packet tracer course, 
334.241989
and
play around with packet tracer yourself when you have time.
337.876558
