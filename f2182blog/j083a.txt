get all of the lab files for this course, so&nbsp;
you can try it out yourself in packet tracer.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,040
If you want more labs like these, I highly&nbsp;
recommend picking up Boson’s NetSim for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,320
CCNA. It’s a network simulator with tons of&nbsp;
guided labs covering all of the topics you&nbsp;&nbsp;

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,040
need to know for the CCNA. Click the link&nbsp;
in the video description to check it out.

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:50,000
In this lab we’ll use TFTP and FTP on R1&nbsp;
and R2 to get updated IOS image files,&nbsp;&nbsp;

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,120
and then reboot the routers with the new&nbsp;
version. First, let’s take a look at SRV1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,720
From the services tab, if I click on TFTP, you&nbsp;
can see at the top that the TFTP service is&nbsp;&nbsp;

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:09,760
enabled by default, so SRV1 will respond to any&nbsp;
TFTP clients trying to download or upload files.&nbsp;&nbsp;

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,240
And down below is a list of files currently&nbsp;
on SRV1, these are operating system files for&nbsp;&nbsp;

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,040
various kinds of devices. The one we’ll be copying&nbsp;
to R1 and R2 is this one here, the same one as in&nbsp;&nbsp;

15
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,880
the lecture video. Okay, then I’ll click on the&nbsp;
FTP tab. The FTP service is enabled by default,&nbsp;&nbsp;

16
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,880
and because FTP uses username and password&nbsp;
authentication, there is a list of FTP users here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,520
The default username and password in Packet&nbsp;
Tracer is cisco and cisco, but I created this one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

18
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,360
username jeremy password ccna. And below&nbsp;
that the same OS files are available.

19
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,120
Step 1 of the lab is to configure IP addresses and&nbsp;
any necessary routing to allow full connectivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,280
For the purpose of this video, I’ve already&nbsp;
done that. I configured IP addresses on SRV1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

21
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:11,920
R1, and R2, and configured a static route to&nbsp;
10.0.0.0/24 on R2. So, let’s go on to step 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

22
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:21,840
On R1 I’ll use TFTP to get the new IOS file from&nbsp;
SRV1. First, I’ll check the current version on R1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

23
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:31,120
ENABLE. SHOW VERSION, and check the top line&nbsp;
of the output. So, the current version is 15.1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

24
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:39,200
and the file I’m going to download from SRV1 is&nbsp;
15.5. Let’s check the current file in flash. SHOW&nbsp;&nbsp;

25
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:47,840
FLASH. There it is. Okay, let’s copy that&nbsp;
new file into flash. The command is COPY TFTP&nbsp;&nbsp;

26
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:56,320
FLASH. Now SRV1’s address, 10.0.0.1. Now the name&nbsp;
of the file we want to copy. I copied the name&nbsp;&nbsp;

27
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,080
beforehand, so I’ll just paste it in here. And now&nbsp;
I’m asked what name I want to save the file as.&nbsp;&nbsp;

28
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,840
The default option is in the square brackets&nbsp;
here, I’ll just hit enter to use that filename.&nbsp;&nbsp;

29
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,160
And this should only take a few seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

30
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,040
Okay, now the file has been copied into&nbsp;
the flash of R1. Let’s check. SHOW FLASH.&nbsp;&nbsp;

31
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,360
There it is. So next let’s configure R1&nbsp;
to boot with this new version of IOS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

32
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:35,600
CONF T. The command is BOOT SYSTEM FLASH, and then&nbsp;
the file name, I’ll paste it here again. Now I’ll&nbsp;&nbsp;

33
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:42,000
EXIT out. And before reloading the system I must&nbsp;
make sure to save the config, or else the BOOT&nbsp;&nbsp;

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,880
SYSTEM command won’t take effect. WRITE. Okay,&nbsp;
finally I’ll use RELOAD to restart the router.&nbsp;&nbsp;

35
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,160
Rebooting a real router can take several&nbsp;
minutes, but fortunately in packet tracer&nbsp;&nbsp;

36
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:04,480
the process is quite fast. So, let’s check to make&nbsp;
sure that R1 is now using the new version of IOS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

37
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:15,280
ENABLE. SHOW VERSION. Okay, R1 is now using the&nbsp;
newer version of IOS. So the final step here on R1&nbsp;&nbsp;

38
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,320
is to delete the old file from flash. SHOW FLASH.&nbsp;
So, I’m just going to copy the filename here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

39
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,520
And then delete it with DELETE FLASH:, with&nbsp;
a colon, and then paste in the filename.&nbsp;&nbsp;

40
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,960
Then confirm that I really want&nbsp;
to delete it, and now let’s check.&nbsp;&nbsp;

41
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:43,360
SHOW FLASH. Okay, the old IOS file is now&nbsp;
gone. Now I’m going to copy the filename&nbsp;&nbsp;

42
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,280
of the new IOS version again since I’ll&nbsp;
use it on R2. Okay, that’s all for R1.

43
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,920
On R2 we’ll do basically the same thing,&nbsp;
but let’s do it using FTP instead of&nbsp;&nbsp;

44
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:06,720
TFTP. First let’s check R2’s current version.&nbsp;
ENABLE. SHOW VERSION. R2 is also using 15.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

45
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:16,800
To use FTP, let’s configure the username&nbsp;
and password. CONF T. IP FTP USERNAME&nbsp;&nbsp;

46
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:27,360
jeremy. IP FTP PASSWORD ccna. That’s it, now&nbsp;
we can copy the file just like in TFTP. EXIT.&nbsp;&nbsp;

47
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:37,840
So, let’s get that IOS file from SRV1. COPY&nbsp;
FTP FLASH. Enter SRV1’s IP address, 10.0.0.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

48
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,320
And then I’ll paste the filename. And hit&nbsp;
enter to use the same filename here on R2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

49
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,360
Okay, now in packet tracer FTP is&nbsp;
actually much slower than TFTP.&nbsp;&nbsp;

50
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,760
In fact I thought it wasn’t working since it&nbsp;
takes so much longer than TFTP. But be patient,&nbsp;&nbsp;

51
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,800
and it will work. I’m going to pause my recording&nbsp;
now and return when the transfer finishes.

52
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,400
Okay, the transfer finished successfully.&nbsp;
Let’s check the file in flash.&nbsp;&nbsp;

53
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:17,600
SHOW FLASH. There it is. Now just like on R1&nbsp;
I’ll configure R2 to boot using this IOS file.&nbsp;&nbsp;

54
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,240
CONF T. BOOT SYSTEM FLASH, and then&nbsp;
paste in the filename once again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

55
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:33,840
Then EXIT. And WRITE to save the&nbsp;
configuration. Now let’s reload R2. RELOAD.&nbsp;

56
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,760
Once again, this should only take about&nbsp;
10 seconds or so in packet tracer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

57
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,960
but on a real router it will take several minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

58
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:54,240
So, let’s check if R2 is now using the&nbsp;
new version of IOS. ENABLE. SHOW VERSION.&nbsp;&nbsp;

59
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:02,160
There it is, version 15.5. To finish up,&nbsp;
let’s delete the old IOS file from flash.&nbsp;&nbsp;

60
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,360
SHOW FLASH. Then copy the file name.&nbsp;
And delete it with DELETE FLASH:,&nbsp;&nbsp;

61
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,880
and paste in the file name. And that’s&nbsp;
it, let’s check. SHOW FLASH. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

62
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,520
the file has been deleted. So, in this lab we&nbsp;
practiced copying files from a server using TFTP&nbsp;&nbsp;

63
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:30,720
and FTP. We also updated the IOS version of these&nbsp;
routers and removed the old IOS files from flash.&nbsp;&nbsp;

64
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:38,480
That’s all for this lab. Next let’s take a look at&nbsp;
a bonus lab in Boson Software’s NetSim for CCNA.

65
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,120
Okay, here's today's Boson NetSim lab preview.&nbsp;
The lab is Trivial File Transfer Protocol, TFTP.&nbsp;&nbsp;

66
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,160
So in this lab we will use TFTP to&nbsp;
backup Router4's configuration file.&nbsp;&nbsp;

67
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,920
So, this is another use for TFTP or FTP. Not to&nbsp;
download new versions of IOS, but to backup files,&nbsp;&nbsp;

68
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:08,240
for example the device's configuration. So&nbsp;
let's go right to the lab tasks. There are&nbsp;&nbsp;

69
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:16,080
8 lab tasks and we'll do all of them. So&nbsp;
step 1 has us configuring the IP adress and&nbsp;&nbsp;

70
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:26,640
default gateway on PC1 and PC3. These two PCs&nbsp;
here. So I will open the CLI of PC1 and PC3.&nbsp;&nbsp;

71
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,360
And the commands to do this in&nbsp;
Boson NetSim are IPCONFIG /IP.&nbsp;&nbsp;

72
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,760
Okay that configures PC1's&nbsp;
IP address. And then IPCONFIG&nbsp;&nbsp;

73
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:53,840
/DG to configure the default&nbsp;
gateway. So that's PC1. Next, PC3.&nbsp;&nbsp;

74
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:09,280
Okay, so that's step 1. Next step 2. On&nbsp;
Router4 attempt to ping PC1. The ping should&nbsp;&nbsp;

75
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:17,600
be successful. Okay, so from Router4 I'll&nbsp;
ping PC1. Let me open the CLI of Router4.&nbsp;&nbsp;

76
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:28,160
Oh there's a password. Okay the&nbsp;
password is Cisco. And let's ping PC1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

77
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,600
Okay, no problem. Next, step 3. On Router4&nbsp;
copy the running configuration to the TFTP&nbsp;&nbsp;

78
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,960
server. Okay, so I'm already on Router4. The&nbsp;
command is COPY, and then the source this&nbsp;&nbsp;

79
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,960
time is the running configuration. So, COPY&nbsp;
RUNNING-CONFIG, and the destination will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

80
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,800
TFTP. And then the address is&nbsp;
PC1's address, 192.168.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

81
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:09,760
Okay, the destination filename, I'll name it&nbsp;
r4config. Alright, there we go. Okay next on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

82
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,000
TFTP server, which is PC1, verify that Router4's&nbsp;
configuration has been successfully backed up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

83
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:23,040
Okay, so the command to do that in NetSim&nbsp;
is SHOW TFTP-CONFIGS. And as it says here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

84
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,000
that is not a standard PC command. It&nbsp;
is just a command used in Boson NetSim.&nbsp;&nbsp;

85
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:36,880
So let's check. SHOW TFTP-CONFIGS. And there is&nbsp;
the file, r4config. And here is the file size.&nbsp;&nbsp;

86
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,880
Okay, next step 5. In the following steps&nbsp;
you will restore the configuration you saved&nbsp;&nbsp;

87
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,840
on the TFTP server to NVRAM, that's&nbsp;
where the startup config is saved,&nbsp;&nbsp;

88
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,880
on Router4 and verify that the starting&nbsp;
configuration was updated successfully.&nbsp;&nbsp;

89
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,920
Okay, so first it has us change&nbsp;
the host name to MainRouter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

90
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:09,520
Okay, so when we backed up the config of Router4&nbsp;
the host name was Router4. So in this file here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

91
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:18,080
r4config, the host name is saved as Router4.&nbsp;
Now we're going to change it to MainRouter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

92
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,160
Okay and now we're going to&nbsp;
restore the configuration&nbsp;&nbsp;

93
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:31,840
from the TFTP server to the NVRAM of Router4.&nbsp;
So the command is COPY, and the source is&nbsp;&nbsp;

94
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:37,120
TFTP, and we're going to save it to&nbsp;
the startup config which is in NVRAM.&nbsp;&nbsp;

95
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:50,320
The address is 192.168.1.2. And the source&nbsp;
filename is r4config. Okay, there we go. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

96
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,840
should now see the restored configuration&nbsp;
in NVRAM. Does NetSim have SHOW NVRAM?&nbsp;&nbsp;

97
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,120
Maybe no, let me see. SHOW NVRAM. It does&nbsp;
not, but we can just do SHOW STARTUP-CONFIG.&nbsp;&nbsp;

98
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,920
And the hostname is this config&nbsp;
file is Router4 as you can see here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

99
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,560
But the hostname is still MainRouter&nbsp;
because that's in the startup-config file,&nbsp;&nbsp;

100
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,800
it's not in the running config. So in step 7&nbsp;
we're going to issue the COPY STARTUP-CONFIG&nbsp;&nbsp;

101
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:34,000
RUNNING-CONFIG command to apply that&nbsp;
configuration to the running-config. So, COPY&nbsp;&nbsp;

102
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:42,080
STARTUP-CONFIG RUNNING-CONFIG. And now&nbsp;
the host name changes back to Router4.&nbsp;&nbsp;

103
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,160
Okay, finally step 8. Is it necessary to&nbsp;
clear Router4's NVRAM in order to copy a&nbsp;&nbsp;

104
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,520
file into it? Explain why or why not. Okay&nbsp;
so I have not covered this in the course.&nbsp;&nbsp;

105
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,520
Let me show you Boson's explanation. So it is&nbsp;
not necessary to clear Router4's NVRAM in order&nbsp;&nbsp;

106
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:10,960
to copy a file into it. So when you copy a file&nbsp;
into NVRAM it totally overwrites that file. So if&nbsp;&nbsp;

107
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:17,040
there's a startup config and you copy a new config&nbsp;
to that file, the old file is totally deleted&nbsp;&nbsp;

108
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,520
and replaced with the new file. However as&nbsp;
it says here, when you copy a file into DRAM,&nbsp;&nbsp;

109
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,040
or the running configuration which is in DRAM,&nbsp;
the files merge. So the new file doesn't totally&nbsp;&nbsp;

110
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,760
replace the original file, they&nbsp;
merge, they become combined.&nbsp;&nbsp;

111
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,080
Anyways, you don't have to know that much&nbsp;
detail I think for the current CCNA exam.&nbsp;&nbsp;

112
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,280
But it's an interesting point. Okay, so that's&nbsp;
all for this lab. Since we did all of the tasks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

113
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,200
let's check with the 'grade lab' function&nbsp;
here. So I'll click on this button.&nbsp;&nbsp;

114
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:01,840
And we completed the lab successfully, perfect.&nbsp;
So all of the configurations are correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;

115
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,800
Okay so that was Boson's NetSim for CCNA. I think&nbsp;
this is a great resource for the CCNA. Theres 100+&nbsp;&nbsp;

116
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,240
guided detailed labs like this covering all&nbsp;
of the topics you need to know for the CCNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;
