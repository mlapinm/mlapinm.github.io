0.549261
Welcome to my complete CCNA, Cisco Certified Network Associate course.
5.899924
This is Jeremy’s IT Lab.
8.97093
Since this is the first video, allow me to introduce the course.
12.495407
This course aims to be a complete course for the CCNA,
17.495152
including everything you need to pass the exam, all 100% free.
21.927437
There will be lecture videos covering every topic on Cisco’s official exam topics list,
29.172025
practice quizzes covering the material in each lecture,
33.327001
flashcards to help you review and remember what you learned,
36.397186
practice labs using Cisco’s network simulation software Packet Tracer,
41.641816
and at the end multiple practice exams to get you ready for the real thing.
46.107725
Although this course will be based on Cisco’s official exam topics list,
51.573099
I also want to give you extra information to improve your
understanding of networks in general. 56.378563
That additional context should also help you understand the exam topics.
61.41736
Because this is the first video in the series, I want to talk about who this course is for.
68.187542
This course is for anyone who wants to pass the CCNA 200-301 exam.
75.46595
At the time of recording this video, this is a new exam that isn’t released yet, but will be coming on February 24th, 2020.
84.865248
Although a lot of the information will overlap with the old CCNA, the course will be based on the exam topics for the 200-301 exam
94.93983
This course is for anyone who wants to learn about computer networking.
100.160551
You don’t necessarily have to take the CCNA 200-301 exam, this course will cover lots of valuable information regarding computer networking even if you’re not aiming for the CCNA.
112.605286
The only requirement for this course is that you have a basic familiarity with computers.
119.436739
I will cover all of the foundational networking knowledge at the beginning of the course,
124.612852
so you don’t need any prior knowledge of networking, and you also don’t need to know programming or anything like that to start this course.
131.550312
With no further ado, let’s get started! 136.245846
Our first lesson will cover network devices.
140.436813
This knowledge will be the foundation which we will build upon during the rest of this course.
145.233898
Take a look at this sample network here. 148.119109
Do you know what each of these symbols represents, and their function in a network?
153.552098
At the end of this lesson, you’ll know these and more,
158.142643
and how they work together to make a network.
160.281065
We won’t go into too many details in this lesson.
163.57054
There’s plenty of time to dig deeper in future lessons,
167.71658
but these first few videos are meant to give you the foundational knowledge which we will build upon in future lessons.
174.004601
So, what is a network?
177.612344
Let’s ask our friends at Wikipedia.
179.896771
‘a computer network is a digital communications network which allows nodes to share resources’.
187.706578
Well, if you didn’t understand before, you probably still don’t after reading just that.
193.645986
Let’s look further.
195.35549
The definition states that a network allows nodes to share resources.
201.084357
What is a node?
203.069761
I’ll introduce some types of network nodes here, some of which appeared in the sample network on the previous slide.
209.830509
This is a router.
213.150157
You’ve probably heard the word before and have a general idea of what a router is.
218.285602
But I’ll explain a router’s function in this lesson.
221.008848
Next, this is a switch.
225.130171
Maybe you’re familiar with what a switch is, maybe not.
229.181407
It serves a different function than a router, but is also similar in many ways.
234.223953
This next one is a firewall.
238.232172
You’re probably familiar with firewalls, and you most likely have a firewall installed on your computer.
244.407903
That’s a software firewall, but large networks usually have a hardware firewall, a separate network appliance, which helps protect the network.
255.695524
This next symbol represents a server.
258.222941
If you know computers, you surely have heard of servers before.
262.856831
What exactly do they do?
264.814673
Well, if you’re watching this video, you’re getting it from a server on the Internet.
270.389262
The last symbol in this slide is a client.
274.736738
You’re using a client to watch this video, whether it’s a smart phone, a laptop, a desktop PC, or whatever.
282.146585
What exactly is a client?
285.010934
Let’s get into it.
286.872277
Over the next few slides let’s build a sample network and look at the functions of each of these network nodes in the network.
294.577449
You might also hear clients, as well as the previous node type, servers, referred to as end hosts or endpoints
304.49143
Okay, so we looked at some types of network nodes,
309.214384
but we didn’t really examine exactly what each type of node does in a network.
314.133924
Let’s build a network and examine each node’s role.
318.314105
So, here we have two PCs.
322.110697
PC1 on the left, and PC2 on the right. 327.282299
As is, this isn’t a network.
330.878499
However, if I connect them together with a cable…
334.433432
We now have a network.
336.820819
That’s right, two PCs connected together actually makes a network!
341.496767
Now, it’s a very simple network, but if we take a look at that Wikipedia definition once more…
347.706105
‘A computer network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources’
354.43809
Now that these two nodes are connected, they can share resources...
359.664632
And essentially have a conversation with each other.
362.815501
Now, I’m representing clients with this symbol.
368.073674
But there are all kinds of devices which can be network clients.
371.901306
For example, a laptop or Desktop PC running Microsoft Windows.
378.035243
Or how about an iMAC running macOS.
382.029957
Or even an apple iphone running iOS.
385.47789
These are just a few examples of devices which can be network clients.
390.170193
So, let’s give a simple definition of a client.
394.594822
A client is a device that accesses a service made available by a server.
400.795164
Okay, since server is part of the definition of a client, to understand one, you have to understand the other.
409.413728
So, what’s a server?
412.180105
Let’s take a look.
413.742433
I used this symbol to represent a server.
417.851204
When you think of the word server, you may thing of something like this IBM server, or this DELL server.
426.356709
And indeed, these are powerful
servers, and you’ll see rows and rows of servers like these in data centers. 433.332645
However, not all servers look like this.
437.229628
In fact, any of the clients we looked at in the previous slide can be servers too!
443.163326
How is that possible?
445.717808
Well, let’s look at the definition of a client again,
449.116908
and then compare it to the definition of a server.
452.027412
The definition we used for a client was ‘a client is a device that accesses a service made available by a server.’
463.815359
So, we can basically reverse that definition to know what a server is.
469.358838
‘A server is a device that provides functions or services for clients.’
474.946009
So, let’s look at the simple network of two PCs connected with a cable that we saw before.
481.106501
Remember this network?
484.119728
Watch this little exchange between the two PCs and think which of them is the server and which is the client.
491.180928
PC1 asks PC2 for the file ‘image.jpg’ PC2 responds and sends the requested image file.
502.770917
So, which is the client and which is the server?
506.898928
Well, PC1 is the one requesting the service, requesting for the image to be sent.
513.209574
And PC2 is the one providing the service, the one sending the image.
518.338896
So that makes PC1 the client, and PC2 the server.
524.512125
Let’s look at another example of a client-server relationship.
529.517459
On the left is your computer, or perhaps your smartphone, whatever you’re using to watch this video.
535.986978
On the right is a YouTube server which contains this video.
540.413115
What do you think the blue cloud in the middle represents?
544.322714
The answer is, The Internet.
547.69339
In network diagrams, a cloud is often used to represent the Internet,
552.885079
or in any situation where the details of that part of the network aren’t necessary.
557.325717
The Internet is a very complex network, and for the sake of this diagram all we need to know is that data from your computer passes through the Internet to reach the YouTube server.
569.37213
The exact details of the Internet aren’t important for this diagram,
573.899841
so we can simply use this cloud to represent the Internet.
577.182007
So, your computer sends a request to the YouTube server for this youtube page, including the video.
584.407894
And youtube’s server sends the data, passing through the Internet, back to your PC.
591.339153
However, YouTube doesn’t send the data all at once.
595.252934
It sends you a stream of data until you’ve watched the whole video.
600.261712
For one more example, let’s say your want to get a video from your friend.
606.969188
You both have iphones, so you ask him to send you the video by airdrop.
611.245468
Your phone requests the video.
615.606527
And his phone responds, sending the video.
618.987186
You probably know it by know, but which phone is the client and which is the server?
623.970831
As you probably guessed, your phone on the left is the client.
628.888043
And your friend’s phone on the right is the server.
632.354859
To review once more.
635.990257
A client is a device that accesses a service made available by a server.
640.263129
And, a server is a device that provide functions or services for clients.
646.105946
Also, keep in mind the same device can be a client in some situations, and a server is other situations.
654.935258
Okay, hopefully you have a better idea of what a client is and what a server is.
661.309736
Now let’s build out the network further, and show the next part of the connection between end hosts and the Internet.
668.999157
Let’s say this is a network for an Enterprise,
673.478909
and this Enterprise has a branch in New York, and a branch in Tokyo.
678.091359
Of course, a real Enterprise branch will have more than just a couple PCs or a couple servers,
683.687049
but I also couldn’t
fit an entire network on this one slide! 687.564604
Typically you don’t connect end hosts like PCs or servers directly to each other.
694.105767
You aggregate the connections to a device called a switch.
698.789556
As you can see, the two PCs are connected to SW1,
703.640369
and the two servers are connected to SW2.
706.81105
Switches have lots of interfaces for you to connect end hosts to.
712.625682
Look at this Cisco Catalyst switch.
716.438507
As you can see, lots of interfaces, or ports, to plug your PCs or servers into.
723.044025
Switches are used to forward traffic within a LAN, a local area network.
729.237329
PC1 and PC2, as well as other devices plugged into SW1,
736.533775
such as a network printer, or another PC,
739.486973
all reside on the same local area network.
742.874504
The same goes for any devices connected to SW2 in the Tokyo Branch.
748.41524
So, we have one LAN on the left, and one LAN on the right.
755.044959
The hosts within each LAN can send data to each other, for example PC1 to PC2.
762.347438
However, these switches cannot connect directly to the Internet.
768.015639
And send data between the two LANs.
772.324045
So let’s talk more about switches.
777.071868
Here on the left is the same Cisco switch from the last slide.
782.082555
It’s a Catalyst 9200 model switch.
785.673191
On the right is a Catalyst 3650 model switch.
789.805248
Catalyst switches are Cisco’s enterprise-grade switches,
795.086548
used by many enterprises to connect their LANs.
797.83013
Now let’s review some characteristics of switches.
802.031492
Switches have many network interfaces or ports for end hosts, such as PCs, to connect to, usually 24 or more.
812.045876
Switches provide connectivity to hosts within the same LAN, meaning Local Area Network.
819.062123
We’ll cover the details of LANs later, but for now just know it means end hosts within the same area,
827.53807
like a bunch of computers on one floor of an office,
830.717455
or perhaps an entire small office, or your home network.
834.866644
Finally, switches do not provide connectivity between LANs or over the Internet.
842.65211
To do so, we need another kind of network device.
846.493452
That device is a router.
850.999024
We can connect the switches to routers like this,
854.643997
and then connect the routers to the Internet.
857.430949
When end hosts in the New York Branch LAN want to communicate with end hosts in the Tokyo Branch LAN,
864.462517
they will send the data to their router, R1, which will then forward it to the Tokyo Branch LAN via the Internet.
872.926584
For example, if PC1 in the New York Branch wants a file on SRV1 in the Tokyo Branch,
880.658397
it will send the request to R1 via SW1,
885.53329
which will forward it over the Internet to R2,
888.793617
which will then send it to SRV1 via SW2.
893.116161
The reply will then follow the reverse path back to PC1.
898.383417
So, let’s talk about some of the characteristics of routers.
903.124906
These are a few examples of Cisco routers you might find in use in an enterprise network.
912.026961
The ISR 1000 and ISR 4000 have their network interfaces on the back,
918.765974
but if you look at the ISR 900 you can probably notice a difference between a router and a switch.
925.914413
Let’s bring up one of the switches we looked at before.
929.531015
Compared to this Catalyst 9200 series switch,
934.434622
the ISR 900 router has relatively few network interfaces.
939.278898
That’s one characteristic of routers compared to switches.
943.60104
Routers have fewer network interfaces than switches.
947.961969
Also, remember that switches are used to forward data within a LAN.
953.954608
Routers do the opposite.
956.362195
Routers are used to provide connectivity BETWEEN LANs.
960.366754
And, because of that, Routers are therefore used to send data over the Internet.
966.46017
Here’s our network once again, but this time there’s a difference.
973.859117
There is an attacker somewhere in the Internet, with an arsenal of many ways he could attack our networks to steal information or otherwise damage our Enterprise.
984.369638
Although routers can also provide some basic security features,
989.208192
what we should really be using to protect our networks is… A firewall.
994.400265
Firewalls are specialty network security devices that control network traffic entering and exiting your network.
1002.952705
Firewalls can be placed ‘outside’ of your router, like FW1, or ‘inside’ of your network, like FW2.
1011.86287
What’s important is that they protect the end hosts inside, like the PCs and Servers in this network.
1020.359884
Firewalls must be configured with security rules to determine which network traffic should be allowed and which should be denied.
1028.669231
If you configure the rules properly, if PC1 in the New York Branch tries to access SRV1 in Tokyo,
1036.995455
the firewalls should permit the traffic through.
1040.628934
The return traffic from SRV 1 to PC1 should be allowed as well.
1046.553635
However, if the attacker tries to access anything inside of our networks, the firewall should block it.
1054.401229
So let’s look at a couple of Cisco’s firewalls.
1059.449572
At the top here are two examples of Cisco firewalls.
1064.001405
On the left is an ASA5500-X series firewall.
1069.491982
The ASA, or adaptive security appliance, is Cisco’s classic firewall.
1075.907059
Although the ASA is their classic firewall, modern
ASAs include modern features of so-called ‘next generation firewalls’, 1085.57209
including things like IPS or intrusion prevention system.
1091.172186
You’ll hear a lot more about that in the security section of this course.
1095.796422
On the right is a Firepower 2100 series firewall.
1100.869909
This is a next-generation firewall as well.
1104.366158
Okay, let’s review some characteristics of firewalls.
1108.770638
Firewalls monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules.
1115.573345
You explicitly configure which network traffic should be allowed in to your network, and which should not.
1121.860298
Firewalls can be placed ‘inside’ the network or ‘outside’ the network.
1127.749188
Meaning, the firewall can filter traffic before it reaches the router,
1131.900401
or after it has passed through the router.
1134.773768
In some cases, you might have a firewall inside and outside the network!
1140.691058
Firewalls are known as ‘next-generation firewalls’ when they include more modern and advanced filtering capabilties.
1149.615475
Both of these Cisco firewalls are considered ‘next-generation firewalls’.
1155.064523
Now, I have one more thing to look at regarding firewalls.
1159.556522
What about the firewall on your computer?
1163.00394
Let’s take a brief look.
1165.320698
The two firewalls we looked at in the previous slide are network firewalls.
1171.091575
Network firewalls are hardware devices that filter traffic between networks.
1176.891448
These are the kind of firewall we will focus on in this course,
1181.203828
as it is a networking course.
1183.075054
However, there are also Host-based firewalls.
1187.371661
Host-based firewalls are software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host machine, like a PC.
1195.9338
Your PC almost certainly has a software firewall installed, as it should.
1202.169978
Even in a network with a hardware firewall, each PC should include a software firewall as an extra line of defense.
1210.191727
Okay, now we’re back to our definition of a network.
1215.563038
Do you understand more about each of these types of network nodes?
1219.5818
Keep in mind, there are other kinds of network devices,
1223.796714
and we’ll cover some of those later in this course.
1226.132738
Stay tuned for this lecture’s supplementary materials
1230.348846
which will help you review and test your knowledge.
1233.090668
In the next lecture we will look at the next two sentences of this Wikipedia definition of a computer network,
1239.64725
focusing on the various kinds of connections between these network devices.
1244.511941
For this lecture, and all other lectures, there will be supplementary materials to help you practice and improve your understanding.
1255.869231
There will be three primary resources: End-of-video quizzes after each video.
1263.043958
This video’s quiz will be coming up right after this slide.
1266.861436
There will also be pre-made flashcards to review the lecture’s material,
1272.769913
using the flashcard software ‘Anki’.
1275.759273
These flashcards will be included in the description of each video.
1280.229755
Since this is the first video, however, I will make a separate video explaining how to download and use the Anki software.
1288.265735
If you already know how to use Anki, feel free to download this video’s flashcards in the description and get started.
1295.91971
Otherwise, wait for the next video and I’ll show you how.
1300.48622
Just one recommendation: As I will upload a separate flashcard deck for each video,
1308.03862
instead of having many separate decks, 1310.386106
I recommend you create one CCNA deck
1313.568205
and then transfer the new cards to that central deck.
1317.018753
Finally, there will be a practice lab using Cisco’s network simulation software ‘Packet Tracer’ for each and every video.
1326.262221
I will release separate videos for these practice labs,
1330.046235
and will include the packet tracer file in the descriptions of those videos so you can download them, and complete them yourself.
1336.921687
The packet practice lab for this video will be a demonstration of how to download packet tracer and get started with it.
1344.320399
Now, let’s go on to this video’s quiz.
1348.250523
Select the best answer from the available choices.
1351.619177
In some cases there are multiple answers that could possibly be correct, but there will always be one best choice.
1359.846831
Cisco exams tend to have lots of questions like that,
1363.858894
so hopefully some of these will be able to test you in a similar manner.
1367.222153
This first video’s quiz questions, however, shouldn’t be too difficult.
1371.991343
Your company wants to purchase some network hardware to which they can connect the 30 PCs in your department.
1381.219477
Which type of network device is appropriate?
1384.121492
A, a router. B, a firewall. C, a switch. Or D, a server.
1394.175379
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1397.443198
The answer is C, a switch.
1405.753995
Let’s analyze each of the incorrect answers first, then the correct answer.
1410.933387
A router, like this Cisco ISR 900 series router, is designed for forwarding traffic between networks,
1419.987267
not for connecting lots of end hosts like PCs to.
1423.298125
Also, a router will not typically have 30 network interfaces to connect hosts to.
1429.513683
So, A, a router, is incorrect.
1432.987473
A firewall, like this Cisco ASA 5500-X series firewall, is designed to filter traffic as it enters and exits the local network.
1444.486429
It is not designed to connect directly to end hosts,
1447.901149
and typically will not have enough network interfaces for 30 hosts.
1451.646913
So, B, a firewall, is incorrect.
1455.863915
A server is an end host itself,
1460.594598
not a networking device to which you will connect other end hosts.
1464.274579
So, D, a server, is incorrect.
1467.947532
A switch, like this Cisco Catalyst 9200 series switch, is designed to connect many end hosts in the same LAN together.
1478.863936
They include many network interfaces to connect hosts to.
1482.692456
So, C, a switch, is the correct answer.
1486.688558
Okay let’s go on to the next question.
1489.431401
You received a video file from your friend’s Apple iPhone using AirDrop.
1496.864283
What was his iPhone functioning as in that transaction?
1500.61134
A, a server. B, a client. Or C, a local area network.
1509.291457
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1512.922419
The answer is A, a server.
1519.801227
Lets’ check the answers.
1523.21716
In this case your iPhone, not your friend’s iPhone.
1527.247023
A client accesses a service, it does not provide a service.
1534.436786
So, B, a client, is incorrect.
1537.956915
An end host like an iPhone does not function as a local area network (LAN) by itself.
1546.396875
It can, however, be a part of a local area network.
1549.686252
So, C, a local area network, is incorrect.
1554.396164
A server is a device that provides functions or services for clients.
1560.596789
In this case, your friend’s phone provided the file to your iPhone.
1565.631501
So, A, a server, is the correct answer.
1569.33916
Let’s go to the next question.
1572.086321
What is your computer or smartphone functioning as while you watch this video?
1578.649763
A, a server. B, an end host. Or C, a client.
1586.213693
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1589.925121
The answer is C, a client.
1596.602429
Let’s check the answers.
1598.615561
Your device is receiving a service, not providing one, so it is not functioning as a server.
1606.549009
Therefore A, a server, is incorrect.
1609.891578
Although your device is an end host, that does not describe its function.
1616.445374
Both servers and clients are end hosts in a network.
1620.799173
So, B, an end host, is incorrect.
1624.480649
Your device is receiving a service from YouTube’s servers.
1629.789287
Therefore, it is functioning as a client.
1633.145436
So, C, a client, is the correct answer.
1636.263727
Let’s go to the next question.
1638.154822
Your company wants to purchase some network hardware to connect its separate networks together.
1645.64202
What kind of network device is appropriate?
1649.009506
A, a firewall. B, a host. C, a LAN. Or D, a router.
1659.613586
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1663.172257
The answer is D, a router.
1669.504758
Let's check.
1670.622068
Although a firewall can connect multiple networks together,
1675.864806
its real purpose is to monitor and control traffic as it enters and exits the network.
1681.243419
So, A, a firewall, is not the best answer.
1685.034815
The term ‘host’ can refer to any type of network node.
1690.835572
So B, a host, is incorrect.
1694.019074
LAN stands for Local Area Network.
1698.896368
A LAN is not a network device itself.
1701.622408
So, C, a LAN, is incorrect.
1704.932616
A router is a device that is designed to connect and forward network traffic between multiple networks.
1711.912618
So, D, a router, is the correct answer.
1716.66589
Let’s go to the final quiz question for this video.
1720.021627
Your company wants to upgrade its old network firewall that has been in use for several years
1726.295656
to one that provides more advanced functions.
1729.553168
What kind of firewall should they purchase?
1732.88488
A, a host-based firewall. B, a next-level firewall. C, a next-generation firewall. Or D, a top-layer firewall.
1748.26403
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1751.947974
The answer is C, a next-generation firewall.
1759.056822
Let’s check each answer.
1761.083773
A host-based firewall is a piece of software that runs on an end host, 1767.563961
like the firewall on your computer.
1770.006001
It is not a network firewall.
1772.455672
So A, a host-based firewall, is incorrect.
1776.660307
Next-level and Top-layer are not actual types of firewalls, so B and D are incorrect.
1784.449591
A next-generation firewall combines traditional firewall features with more advanced filtering functionalities.
1793.793805
So C, a next-generation firewall, is correct.
