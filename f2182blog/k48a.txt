lab we will take a look at STP spanning
tree protocol 24.909351 and do some basic
configurations 27.085037 spanning tree is
necessary to prevent layer 2 loops which
would otherwise render your network
useless 34.082099 in this topology for example
without spanning tree a layer 2
broadcast would loop around the 3
switches endlessly
42.018786 and with enough of that in your network
your networker is not going to be
operating well 46.070623 just to clarify that if
switch 1 sends a broadcast it goes to
switch 2 and switch 3 53.314998 then both of them
flood the broadcast out every port
except the one they received it on 58.719852 then
the process repeats and it will go from
switch 1 2 switch 2 to switch 3 to
switch 1 2 switch 2 to switch 3 and also
the same thing in the other direction
69.196435 that's why spanning tree is essential in
a case like this 72.730685 anyway let's get
started 75.111060 the first step just asks us some
questions about STP 80.519789 the first is which
version is currently running on the
switches 84.626955 there are multiple versions for
example common spanning tree the old
original version also per VLAN spanning
tree rapid spanning tree rapid per VLAN
spanning tree so which is running on
these switches by default 99.474914 these are all
the same models so let's just check on
switch one 103.116268 enable show spanning tree
summary 109.081435 right here the first line 111.925060 switch
is in P vs T mode 114.181226 so there's our answer
116.568663 p vs t is per VLAN spanning tree 119.491496 that
means each VLAN has its own spanning
tree instance running which we can
configure individually 125.721329 you can see that
down here 129.230454 there is VLAN 1 the default di
on which all generally ignore
for this lab 134.098537 and then our three VLANs 10
20 and 30
137.642766 the next question is what is the bridge
ID for each switch 143.802016 first what exactly is
a bridge ID 147.759536 it is a value used to
determine the root bridge in spanning
tree 152.048598 it consists of two parts 154.582577 the bridge
priority which is 3 2 7 6 8 by default
plus the MAC address 161.035785 which is used as a
tie breaker if the bridge priorities are
the same 164.580910 the switch with the lowest
bridge ID becomes the root bridge 169.069847 so
let's checks which ones bridge ID 172.327242 show
spanning tree
174.625617 so for VLAN 1 the priority is 3 2 7 6 9
which is the default priority of 3 2 7 6
8 plus the VLAN number one 185.877471 then the MAC
address is here
beginning with zero zero six zero 190.993366 note
that the information up here is for the
root bridge 195.604346 and down here is for this
switch itself 198.759241 the information is
different so clearly switch 1 is not the
root  bridge 203.577846 switch ones bridge ID will
be essentially the same for each VLAN
but the priority will differ because the
VLAN ID is added to the default priority
212.353095 C 3 2 7 7 8 3 2 7 8 8 & 3 2 7 9 8 223.493074 okay
now let's check the bridge ID on switch
2 226.530782 enable show spanning tree 233.173615 again the
priorities will be the same as on switch
1 236.343865 3 2 7 6 9 4 VLAN 1 3 2 7 7 8 4 VLAN 10
etc 242.235072 and here is the MAC address
beginning with 0 0 0 1 247.450738 note that the
info down here is the same as the info
in the route ID section 253.295447 and the route ID
section itself says this bridge is the
root 257.164613 so that answers the next question -
as to what is the root bridge for each
VLAN 262.502070 because we haven't done any
configurations yet 265.490527 the priorities are
all the same
267.336381 so the switch with the lowest MAC
address will become the root for all
VLANs 271.608360 switch 2 in this case 273.100922 let's
quickly take a look at switch threes
bridge ID also 277.513942 enable show spanning tree
283.550067 again the priorities are the same and
the MAC address begins with 0 0 0 4 290.180629 so
indeed switch 2 has the lowest Mac
292.974441 switch ones Mac began with 0 0 6 0 the
highest 297.726920 then switch 3 with 0 0 0 4 and
then switch 2 at 0 0 0 1 the lowest
303.797045 okay the next question is what is the
STP cost of each interface
310.358170 well the interface is connecting the
switches are Gigabit Ethernet interfaces
315.874545 they have a default STP cost of 4 319.061920 on the
other hand the interface is connected to
the PCs which are still actively sending
spanning TB PDUs or bridge protocol data
units even though a switch isn't
connected to them 330.167503 our Fast Ethernet
interfaces 332.427357 which have a default cost of
19 334.998711 look at the show spanning tree
command here 339.152336 you can see Gigabit
Ethernet interfaces with the cost of 4
and Fast Ethernet interfaces with a cost
of 19 347.568273 the next question is which
interface is blocked and why 354.164168 well you
can see on packet tracer which is
blocked due to the port lights 358.438814 let's
just check with the show command on
switch 1 362.106647 let's look at the output of
show spanning tree again 367.043793 you can see
that gig 0 1 interface is blocking as
BLK indicates here 373.360772 why is that 375.623147 well
switch 2 is the root bridge so all of
its ports are designated ports 381.194251 switch
ones gig 0 2 interface and switch 3s gig
0 one interface have the lowest cost to
the root for them 390.176021 so they are route
ports and it will forward traffic 392.967125 now we
have to block one part between switch 1
and switch 3 to prevent loops 398.546250 so switch
1 and switch 3
compare their bridge IDs and because
switch ones is the highest it blocks the
gig zero one port 406.810646 okay
finally let's get to some configurations
411.964708 step two says to change the spanning
tree mota RP VST rapid per VLAN spanning
tree 418.559979 if your switches support rapid P
VST you really should use it because it
allows the network to converge much
faster when there are changes 426.814416 all it
takes is one command on each switch 430.173916 ON
switch one first 432.288521 conf T spanning tree
mode rapid P vs T 438.218416 that's it 439.976561 now switch
2 441.946248 conf t spanning tree mode rapid P
vs T 448.363310 and finally switch three 450.600268 conf t
spanning tree mode rapid P vs T 456.923268 okay
that's it 458.742851 now it's time to manipulate
the spanning trees a little bit 463.452663 we're
going to change the root bridge for each
VLAN 466.277454 and also configure a secondary
route to specify which switch we want to
be the route if the route fails 472.218329 let's go
and configure our primary routes 475.877266 on
switch 1 spanning tree VLAN 10 root
primary 484.786578 okay then switch 2 487.024912 spanning
tree VLAN 20 root primary 492.649703 and then
switch three 496.846453 spanning tree VLAN 30 root
primary 500.537890 okay now let's set the secondary
VLANs 504.385911 switch three here should be the
secondary route for VLAN 20 so spanning
tree VLAN 20 route secondary 513.550994 then switch
1 516.307931 spanning tree VLAN 30 route
secondary and finally switched 2
524.898306 spanning tree VLAN 10 route secondary 529.157243 ok
now both of these commands adjust the
span to be priority of the switch down
534.704951 let's check what the priorities are here
on switch 2 537.895451 do show spanning-tree look
at VLAN 10 for which switch 2 is the
secondary route 547.072513 it brings the priority
down to two eight six seven two plus ten
for the VLAN ID 553.146013 now look at VLAN 24 rich
it is the route 558.303867 2 4 5 7 6 plus 24 the
VLAN ID 564.612512 ok finally we are going to
enable port fast and bpdu guard on the
appropriate interfaces 571.994408 these should be
enabled on interfaces not connected to
another switch 576.697616 bpdu guide will put an
interface in the air disabled mode if a
bpdu is received on the port 583.545262 and port
fast allows interfaces to start
forwarding without having to wait for
the spanning tree to converge
588.951928 now you can enable port fest here from
global configuration mode with spending
to the port fast default 596.210428 which will
enable it on all access ports
598.846886 you can also configure it at the
interface level 602.378657 let's do that 603.595428 interface
range F 0 1 to 3 608.758719 spanning-tree portfast
spanning tree bpdu guard enable 615.394552 ok let's
do it on switch 1 next 619.068593 interface range F
0 1 to 3 spanning-tree portfast spending
to the bpdu guard enable 630.111009 finally switch
3 633.546301 interface range F 0 1 to 3
spanning-tree portfast spanning tree
bpdu guard enable 645.516780 okay so this slab was
a little longer than usual 650.357217 but there's a
lot to say about spanning tree and it's
a big exam topic 653.562446 make sure you're
familiar with everything on the exam
