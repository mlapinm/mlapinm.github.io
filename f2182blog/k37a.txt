description this lab will be the first

in a series of three labs on mat network

address translation this first lab will

cover static NAT static NAT creates a

one-to-one relationship between an

inside address typically an IP address

in a private address range such as

192.168.1.0

and an outside address typically a

public IP address on the Internet

I won't explain in detail how NAT works

hopefully you've already studied it this

lab will give you some basic practice in

configuring static NAT let's look at

step 1

ripp has been pre-configured so that any

device on this network should be able to

reach any other device let's try a ping

from pc-12 server one ping one dot one

dot one dot one hundred it doesn't work

why could this be I wrote a hint here

stating that the serial connection

between r1 and r2 is using ACLs to

simulate the Internet

what exactly does that mean well PC ones

address is 192.168.1.1 this is a private

IP address these private IP addresses

cannot be routed over the internet so

when PC one attempts to ping server one

the source IP is 192.168.1.1 and the

destination is one one one one hundred

one dot one dot one dot one hundred is a

public IP address so it can be routed

over the Internet however when server

one sends a reply the addresses are

swapped the source addresses 1.1.1 100

and the destination addresses 192.168.1

11 because 192.168.1.1 is in the

IP address range it cannot be routed

over the Internet and is dropped so our

goal is to configure static NAT on r1 to

translate the private IP addresses of

pc-1 pc2 and pc3 to public IP addresses

if we do that PC one will send a ping to

server one and once again the source

address will be 192.168.1 elleven and

the destination 1.1.1 100 however when

the packet reaches our one our one will

translate the source address to whatever

we specify 1 2 3 11 in this case when

server 1 sends its reply the source

address will be once again 1 1 1 100 and

the destination 1 2 3 11 when the reply

reaches r1 r1 will translate the

destination address from Wanda 2 3 11

back to PC ones address of 192.168.1 11

so let's get to the configuration on r1

enable coffee tea first we have to

specify our ones interfaces as inside or

outside nap interfaces the inside

interface faces our inside private

network so G 0 0 in this case interface

G 0 0 IP NAT inside the outside

interface will be s 0 3 0 our interface

facing the internet interface as a 0 3 0

IP NAT outside exit now let's configure

the translations themselves static NAT

is configured with the following command

IP NAT inside source

static followed by the inside private

address then the outside public address

so for PC 1 are inside addresses

192.168.1 11 and our outside addresses 1

2 3 11 okay that's it for a PC

now let's do the same command for PC -

just changing the addresses IP nat

inside source static 192.168.1 12 1 2 3

12 finally for pc 3 IP nat inside source

static 192.168.1.1 2.3 13 ok our nat

configuration is now complete let's go

on the PCs and try to ping server 1

again from pc1 first ping 1.1.1 100 the

ping works this time

so our NAT configuration has been

successful just to make sure I'll ping

from PC - and PC 3 as well PC 2 first

ping 1.1.1 100 again the ping works

finally let's ping from PC 3 ping 1.1.1

100 PC 3 works as well that's all for
