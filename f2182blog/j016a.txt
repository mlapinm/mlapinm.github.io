Also, remember to download and use the Anki flashcards with the link in the description,
24.000
which will help you very much in remembering what you've learned. Let’s get started.
29.630
In this video we’ll take a break from IP addresses and take a look at switch interfaces.
35.800
When we configured IP addresses, I talked about router interfaces a little bit.
40.999
For example, we used the ‘show ip interface brief’ command to check the Layer 1 and
46.530
Layer 2 status of the interfaces.
49.480
I also talked about how router interfaces are disabled with the ‘shutdown’ command by default.
55.699
This time we’ll take a look at switch interfaces and see how they are different from router
59.579
interfaces, and also how they are the same.
63.010
Specifically, we’re going to talk about configuring Layer 1 characteristics of these
67.969
interfaces, such as speed and duplex.
72.530
So let me introduce what we’ll cover in this video.
75.270
I’ll talk about interface speed and duplex.
79.640
Speed refers to the data rate in bits per second, such as 10, 100, or 1000 megabits per second.
88.000
Duplex is something I mentioned briefly in a previous video, basically it refers to whether
92.840
a device is able to both send AND receive data at the same time.
97.000
I’ll talk about speed and duplex autonegotiation, which allows two devices to negotiate speed
103.610
and duplex settings without us having to manually configure them.
107.799
I’ll talk about interface status.
110.090
I already talked about this in the previous video on configuring router interfaces, but
115.369
I’ll expand upon the topic.
117.350
Finally, I’ll talk about interface counters and errors.
122.270
Cisco devices keep various counters regarding the traffic that passes through them, such
126.659
as how many errors have occurred, etc.
128.920
I’ll show you how to find and analyze these statistics, and what kinds of errors there are.
136.209
Also let me review one point about switches that I mentioned in the very first video in this series.
142.370
Up top is a photo of a Cisco ASR 1000-X router, and under it is a Cisco Catalyst 9200 switch.
151.020
What’s the big difference that stands out here?
154.569
How about the number of interfaces?
157.150
The router has 8 SFP interfaces for fiber-optic cables, and then a few RJ45 interfaces for
164.260
the console port and such.
166.739
The switch, on the other hand, has 4 SFP interfaces, plus FORTY EIGHT RJ45 interfaces.
174.330
This is because switches are used to connect end hosts to.
178.129
This catalyst switch might have 48 PCs connected to the RJ45 ports, and then connect to a router
184.689
with the SFP fiber optic ports.
189.120
Next let me introduce the network topology I’ll use for this video.
193.870
This is a single LAN, 192.168.1.0/24, with one router, R1, two switches, SW1 and SW2,
204.040
and four PCs, PC1, 2, 3, and 4.
208.099
In a real network with two switches there would be many more end hosts, but just for
212.799
this demonstration I’ve attached just these four PCs.
216.860
SW1 is the device we’re going to focus on today, configuring its network interfaces,
222.129
including F0/1, F0/2, F0/3, and F0/4 which are connected, as well as the remaining interfaces
229.510
which are not connected at the moment.
231.280
Let’s go right into the CLI of SW1.
236.040
First I use ‘enable’ to enter privileged exec mode.
239.140
After entering privileged exec mode, I entered the ‘show ip interface brief’, using shortcuts.
246.849
As you can see, the four interfaces which are connected to devices, fastethernet 0/1,
252.079
0/2, 0/3, and 0/4 have a status column, which is the Layer 1 status, and a protocol column,
259.690
which is the Layer 2 status, of UP and UP.
263.590
We usually call this up/up.
266.780
Keep in mind I haven’t done any configuration on SW1 yet except set the hostname.
271.860
So already we can see a difference between Cisco routers and switches. What is that?
277.360
Well, I mentioned briefly in the Day 8 video,
281.050
router interfaces are in an administratively disabled state by default, meaning they have
286.200
the ‘shutdown’ command applied.
289.090
Switch interfaces, however, are different.
291.680
They don’t have the shutdown command applied, so if you connect them to another device they’ll
296.730
usually be in the up/up state with no configuration required.
300.750
Now, the IP address is unassigned, and it will remain that way because these are layer
306.300
2 switchports, they don't need an IP address.
310.620
The concept of multilayer switching, where you actually DO assign IP addresses to switches,
316.340
will be for a future lesson.
318.780
For this lesson, don’t worry about the IP address column.
322.690
Now take a look at the other interfaces, keep in mind I’m ignoring the ‘VLAN1’ virtual
328.389
interface, that will be a topic for another video.
331.800
These other interfaces aren’t connected to any other devices, so their status is down/down.
338.550
Keep in mind, down and down is different than administratively down and down.
344.150
Here’s the show ip interface brief command on a router, notice administratively down
349.889
and down, this is because of the ‘shutdown’ command’.
353.740
‘DOWN/DOWN’ doesn’t mean the interfaces are shutdown, it means they aren’t connected to another device.
360.030
So, to summarize, router interfaces have the shutdown command applied by default, so they
366.390
will be in the administratively down/down state by default.
371.610
Switch interfaces do not have the shutdown command applied by default, so they will either
375.850
be in the up/up state, if they are connected to another device, or the down/down state, if not connected.
384.449
Now let’s look at another useful command to check on switch interfaces.
387.690
That is ‘show interfaces status’.
391.460
Let’s look at each field of the output.
394.830
First, the port field simply lists each interface.
399.139
Next, you might be wondering what this ‘name’ field is.
402.590
Well, its the description of the interface.
405.120
I’m not sure why they called it ‘name’ and not ‘description’, but we’ll configure
409.341
descriptions on these interfaces and you’ll see that it appears here.
414.380
Next is the status field.
416.850
As you can see this is different than the status field of show ip interface brief.
421.880
The four connected interfaces show a status of ‘connected, and the unconnected interfaces
427.349
show a status of ‘notconnect’.
430.120
There are other possible statuses, we’ll cover them as they come up in the course.
435.610
Next is the VLAN field.
438.259
VLANs will get their own video, basically they can be used to divide LANs into smaller LANs.
444.669
As you can see, the default VLAN is 1.
448.070
The only one that does not show a VLAN of 1 is F0/2, which shows trunk.
453.099
I won’t explain trunks now, they’ll be covered in the VLAN video.
458.639
Just take note of the fact that the interface connected to the other switch, SW2, is a trunk interface.
466.330
Next is the duplex field, which as I mentioned before indicates whether the device is capable
471.590
of both sending and receiving data at the same time, which is known as full-duplex,
477.410
or if its not, which is called half-duplex.
481.300
Duplex is auto by default on Cisco switches, meaning it will negotiate with the neighboring
486.610
device and use full-duplex if possible.
490.970
Notice that all of the unconnected interfaces have a duplex of auto, and the connected interfaces
496.770
have a duplex of ‘a dash full’ Well, the ‘a’ stands for auto, and it means that
502.979
it automatically negotiated a duplex of auto with the neighboring device.
508.830
Next is the speed field, which is also auto by default.
513.080
These are fastethernet interfaces, so they are capable of speeds up to 100 megabits per second.
519.030
However, they are also capable of operating at 10 megabits per second.
524.450
Auto means they are able to negotiate with the device they are connected to and use the
529.030
fastest speed both devices are capable of.
532.820
This time, we see ‘a DASH 100’, meaning a speed of 100 megabits per second was auto-negotiated
538.810
with the neighboring device.
540.520
I’ll talk in more detail about auto negotiation soon.
544.900
Okay, finally is the Type field.
548.140
These are all RJ45 interfaces for copper UTP cables, but if they were small form-factor
554.630
pluggable, or SFP, modules, you’d see that here instead.
559.570
In this case, we see 10/100BASE-TX, the 10/100 of course referring to the speeds at which
567.010
these interfaces can operate.
571.120
Autonegotiation works well so usually you’ll leave it be, but lets go and manually configure
576.210
the speed and duplex of an interface, F0/1 which is connected to R1.
582.850
As you can see, I enter interface config mode, and then use the command speed.
588.010
I use the context-sensitive help to display the next option, and I can choose between
593.900
10 or 100 megabits per second, or auto.
597.540
So, I set the speed to 100, since R1’s interface is a fastethernet interface also.
603.880
Then, I use the command ‘duplex’ to set the duplex of the interface.
609.150
As the context-sensitive help shows, I can choose between auto, which is the default, or full and half.
617.350
Both SW1 and R1 support full duplex, so I choose that.
621.580
Finally, I configure a description on the interface, indicating that it is connected to R1.
628.250
Okay, so when I use the ‘show interfaces status’ command once again, you can see
634.730
both the configured description and the configured speed and duplex.
640.200
Notice the duplex is full, rather than a dash full, and the speed is 100, rather than a
646.850
dash 100, because they are not being autonegotiated any more.
651.700
Once again, normally you will keep autonegotiation on, but if perhaps there is some problem and
658.440
its not working, you should know how to manually configure the speed and duplex of an interface.
663.800
Now, let me quickly do some configurations for the other connected interfaces off-camera…
668.050
Okay, so I just configured descriptions on F0/2, 0/3, and 0/4.
674.730
Now, how about the unused interfaces?
678.850
Although the fact that switch interfaces are enabled by default is convenient, as you can
683.260
just plug a device in and use it straight away, it can be a security concern.
688.820
Really, you should disable the interfaces.
692.330
Fortunately, instead of having to configure each of the 8 interfaces one by one, there
698.001
is a way to configure all 8 interfaces at once.
701.820
Here’s the command that can save you a lot of time.
705.830
From global config mode, type ‘interface range’, and then enter the range like this, f0/5 to 12.
716.320
This time, instead of interface config mode, I am brought to interface range config mode,
722.370
and I enter a description, and then shut down the interfaces.
725.980
All at once, I get messages saying the interfaces have changed to administratively down.
732.270
Now, before we check show interfaces status once more, let me show you a cool thing about this command.
739.950
The interfaces in the range don’t all have to be consecutive.
744.160
For example, if I later want to enter fastethernet 0/5, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12, but leave 7 and
752.810
8 shutdown, I can do this: interface range f0/5 to 6, COMMA, f0/9 to 12.
763.130
Then if I issue ‘no shutdown’, you can see only those interfaces and enabled.
768.840
F0/7 and 8 remain down.
772.210
Okay, so I shutdown interfaces f0/5,6,9,10,11, and 12 again, and here’s the output of show interfaces status again.
782.910
Now you can see the description of each interface, and the status is disabled.
787.990
Once again, this status is different than the status shown in ‘show ip interface brief’,
793.000
which will now be ‘administratively down’, although really they mean the same thing.
799.500
Before talking about autonegotiation, I want to explain full and half duplex.
804.480
I have briefly mentioned it a few times, but haven’t explained it in depth yet.
810.620
Half duplex means that the device cannot send and receive data at the same time.
815.940
If it is receiving a frame, it must wait before sending a frame.
820.930
Full duplex means that the device CAN send and receive data at the same time.
825.130
It does not have to wait.
827.380
Clearly, full duplex is the preferred way to go.
831.450
In modern networks that use switches, all devices can use full duplex on their interfaces.
837.420
So, you may be wondering where is half-duplex used?
841.080
Well, in modern day networks, almost nowhere.
845.940
But to understand half-duplex let me introduce you to an old type of network device which
851.370
was around before the network switch.
854.620
The hub is much simpler than a switch, in fact it is simply a repeater.
860.410
Any frame it receives, it floods like a switch does with a broadcast or unknown unicast frame.
866.920
For example, if PC1 wants to send a frame to PC2, it will send the frame out of its network interface,
874.520
and after the hub receives it, it will repeat the frame out of its other interfaces, to PC2 and PC3.
881.480
PC3 will recognize that the destination MAC Address is not its own and ignore the frame,
887.800
and PC2 will receive it normally.
890.400
Now, what if two PCs try to send frames at the same time?
895.470
In this case, PC1 is trying to send a frame to PC2, and PC3 is trying to send a frame to PC1.
903.320
They both send the frames out of their network interfaces,
907.390
and this is where a problem occurs.
910.100
The hub won’t send one first and then send the other after, it simply tries to flood
914.830
both at the same time, and this will result in a collision on the interface, and PC2 won’t
921.250
receive either frame intact.
924.060
All devices connected to a hub are part of what’s called a collision domain.
928.870
The frames they send could collide with frames any of the other devices connected to the hub send.
935.020
To deal with collisions in a half-duplex situation like this, Ethernet devices use a mechanism called ‘CSMA/CD’.
942.100
Let’s check it out.
945.260
CSMA/CD stands for ‘carrier sense multiple access with collision detection’.
952.220
It describes how devices avoid collisions in a half-duplex situation, and how they react
957.500
if collisions do occur.
959.660
It works like this.
961.880
Before sending frames, devices listen to the collision domain until they detect that other
967.120
devices are not sending frames.
968.930
If a collision does occur, which can still happen because of bad timing and such, the
975.060
device sends a jamming signal to inform the other devices that a collision happened.
980.770
Each device then waits a random period of time before sending frames agan.
985.710
The process then repeats, with each device listening to check if other devices are sending
990.260
frames before sending their own frames.
993.280
Now, that process works, and it was how networks operated for a long time.
998.860
But switches are more sophisticated than hubs.
1002.180
Hubs are simple repeaters which operate at layer 1, repeating whatever signals they receive.
1008.440
Switches operate at layer 2, using layer 2 addressing, MAC addresses, to send frames to specific hosts.
1015.810
They also won’t try to send two frames to the same host at once.
1019.350
So, this network which was one collision domain when connected to a hub, is now 1, 2, 3 collision domains.
1028.440
Because of the improved functionality of switches over hubs, these devices can now operate in
1033.370
full duplex, meaning they don’t have to worry about whether or not other devices are
1038.300
sending data at the same time, they can send data freely.
1043.069
Although problems like collisions still do occur, they are rare and usually are a sign
1048.110
of a problem, like a misconfiguration, rather than a regular occurrence like in a half-duplex network.
1055.410
So let’s review half and full duplex once more.
1058.330
In half duplex, the device cannot send and receive data at the same time.
1063.870
If it is receiving a frame, it must wait before sending a frame.
1068.360
Devices attached to a hub must operate in half duplex.
1072.490
In modern networks, you’re probably not going to use a hub, but it’s a possibility.
1077.790
In full duplex, the device can send and receive data at the same time, it does not have to wait.
1084.620
Devices attached to a switch can operate in full duplex.
1088.230
Okay, now that you know what duplex is let’s talk about speed and duplex autonegotiation
1094.000
on interfaces, and this applies to both routers and switches by the way.
1099.880
Interfaces that can run at different speeds, for example 10/100 or 10/100/1000, have default
1107.290
settings of speed auto and duplex auto.
1111.750
Interfaces advertise their capabilities to their neighbors, and they negotiate the best
1116.020
speed and duplex settings they are both capable of.
1118.600
So, let’s look at an example.
1121.520
Here’s a small network, a switch with three PCs connected.
1126.910
Connected to G0/1 is a PC with a regular ethernet interface.
1132.020
Connected to G0/2 is a PC with a fastethernet interface. and connected to G0/3 is a PC with
1139.650
a gigabit ethernet interface.
1142.490
As you probably know by now, an Ethernet interface can run at 10 megabits per second,
1147.430
a fastethernet interface can run at 10 or 100 megabits per second, and a gigabit ethernet
1152.990
interface can run at 10, 100, or 1000 gigabits per second.
1158.650
So, G0/1 and the PC will negotiate to a speed of 10 megabits per second, and full duplex.
1165.420
G0/2 and the PC will negotiate to a speed of 100 and full duplex.
1171.420
And g0/3 and the PC will negotiate to speed 1000 and full duplex.
1177.420
The PCs are all able to use the max speed of their network interfaces, and the switch
1182.040
adjusts the speeds of its interfaces to match.
1185.590
In a network like this with all PCs and switches, there’s no reason to use half-duplex, so
1190.760
they all negotiate to use full-duplex.
1192.980
Now, let’s talk about another situation.
1197.240
What if autonegotiation is disabled on the device connected to the switch?
1201.170
So, the switch is trying to autonegotiate, but the other devices don't respond.
1206.650
Well, this is how the switch will respond.
1209.720
For the speed, the switch will try to sense the speed that the other device is operating at.
1215.180
If it fails to sense the speed, it will use the slowest supported speed, for example 10
1221.060
Mbps on a 10/100/1000 interface.
1224.840
Now, as for duplex, if it ends up using a speed of 10 or 100 mbps, the switch will use half duplex.
1233.790
If the speed is 1000 mbps or greater, it will use full duplex.
1239.060
So let’s see how this works.
1241.260
In this case, only the switch is using autonegotiation, and the three PCs have manual, fixed speed and duplex settings.
1249.060
We’ll also assume that the switch successfully detects the speed that the PCs are using.
1254.730
The Green PC has a speed of 10 Mbps, so the switch detects that and sets its speed to the same.
1262.860
Because its speed is 10 Mbps, it sets its speed to half duplex.
1268.230
Now, how about G0/2, connected to the Red PC?
1273.130
It senses that the PC is using a speed of 1000 mbps, so it uses the same.
1279.110
Because the speed is 1000 Mbps, it uses full duplex.
1284.300
Now how about G0/3, connected to the blue PC?
1288.900
It senses the speed of 100 mbps, but then what about the duplex?
1294.500
The PC is using full duplex, but without autonegotiation the switch cant sense that.
1300.380
So, because the speed is 100 Mbps, the switch uses half duplex.
1306.400
This results in a duplex mismatch, which will cause collisions to occur, resulting in poor network performance.
1312.980
So, really you should be using autonegotiation on all devices in the network.
1319.610
Now let’s take a look at some of the errors that can show up on interfaces that otherwise
1323.430
seem to be working.
1325.680
The switch will take count of some of these things and you can view them with the ‘show interfaces’ command.
1331.610
We took a quick look at this command when we were configuring router interfaces, so
1335.860
these things aren’t specific for switch interfaces.
1339.580
This time, let’s focus on some of these statistics at the bottom.
1344.200
There are lots of different kinds of counters shown here and you don’t have to know all
1347.370
of them at this point, so let’s just focus on some.
1351.680
First up, not errors, but you can see the total number of packets received on the interface,
1357.300
and the total number of bytes in those packets.
1360.770
Next up is runts.
1362.480
These are frames that are smaller than the minimum Ethernet frame size of 64 bytes.
1368.160
Beside the runts counter is the giants counter, which counts received frames which are larger
1373.330
than the ethernet maximum frame size of 1518 bytes.
1379.260
Next up, CRC, which counts frames which failed their CRC check.
1384.700
If you remember, the CRC is the cyclic redundancy check done via the FCS, or frame check sequence,
1392.020
in the trailer of an ethernet frame.
1394.320
It’s used to detect errors, and if an error is detected this counter goes up.
1401.260
Next is frame, which counts frames that have an incorrect or illegal format.
1407.260
Input errors is a total of various counters, including the four I just mentioned.
1412.180
Finally, output errors counts frames the switch tried to send, but failed due to an error.
1419.600
Keep in mind, I’m showing you all of these counters on a switch, but they are the same on a router.
1426.630
Before moving on to today’s quiz, let’s review what we covered.
1430.690
We talked about interface speed and duplex.
1433.200
I explained the concepts of full and half duplex.
1437.570
Full duplex is preferred, and in most modern networks all devices will be able to operate
1442.380
in full duplex, so they can send data freely without waiting for other devices to stop sending.
1449.430
We talked about speed and duplex autonegotiation, which allows devices to find the appropriate
1454.760
speed and duplex settings without manual configuration.
1458.890
We looked a bit at interfaces status using the ‘show interface status’ command, such
1463.990
as the statuses connected, notconnect, and disabled.
1468.200
We’ll look more at this throughout the course.
1471.430
Finally, we looked at some interface counters and errors such as runts, which are frames
1477.030
that don’t meet the minimum size requirements, and giants, which exceed the maximum frame size requirements.
1484.370
Okay, let’s get started on the quiz.
1487.770
Remember, there will also be flashcards which you can download from the link in the description
1491.920
to help you remember what you learned in this video.
1494.510
Let’s go to question 1.
1498.140
There is a duplex mismatch between SW1’s F0/1 interface and SW2’s F0/1 interface, which are connected. Autonegotiation is disabled.
1508.550
What will be the result? A, improved performance.
1513.200
B, collisions will occur.
1515.720
Or C, SW1 will sense SW2’s duplex setting and adjust to match.
1521.630
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1527.120
The answer is B, collisions will occur.
1530.370
The half duplex side is unable to send and receive data at the same time.
1534.690
However, the full duplex side is unaware of this, and will send data even if the half
1539.490
duplex side isn’t ready to receive it, causing collisions.
1543.090
So, B is correct.
1545.870
It definitely won’t result in improved performance, in fact performance will probably be much
1550.770
worse, so A is incorrect.
1552.670
SW1 won’t be able to sense SW2’s duplex setting without autonegotiation enabled, so
1558.481
C is incorrect too.
1560.360
Let’s go to question 2.
1563.800
What is used on half-duplex interfaces to detect and avoid collisions?
1568.830
A, CSMA/CD, B, CSMA/CA.
1575.070
C, Autonegotiation, or D, Duplex Auto.
1581.150
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1587.540
The answer is a, CSMA/CD.
1590.710
CSMA CD stands for carrier sense multiple access with collision detection.
1597.610
It describes how devices using half-duplex listen for activity on a network segment,
1603.130
and then send data only when other devices aren't sending.
1607.370
It also describes how a device will react when a collision does occur.
1611.600
So A, CSMA/CD is correct.
1614.400
B, CSMA/CA, is a similar concept that we’ll cover later in the course that stands for
1621.809
carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance.
1625.360
C, autonegotiation, and D, duplex auto, are unrelated to how a half-duplex interface detects and avoids collisions.
1634.559
Let’s go to question 3.
1638.700
Which command shows various counters of errors detected on an interface? A, show interfaces.
1645.670
B, show ip interface brief.
1649.440
C, show interfaces status.
1652.990
Or D, show interfaces errors.
1656.050
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1662.150
The answer is A, show interfaces.
1664.640
Let’s check the output of each command.
1668.870
As you can see, show ip interface brief doesn’t display any counters of errors detected on the interface.
1675.430
It’s a useful command for checking the IP addresses of interfaces, checking if they’re shutdown, etc.
1682.800
Show interfaces status also doesn’t show any error counters.
1686.990
It gives some basic information about interfaces such as description, status, duplex and speed.
1694.170
show interfaces errors isn’t a real command, so an error message appears when I try to enter it.
1701.170
Show interfaces displays counters of errors detected on the interface.
1705.740
In this case I used ‘show interface f0/1.
1709.920
Because so much information is given for each interface, you probably won’t use this command
1715.190
to view all interfaces at once, but rather specify an individual interface to check.
1721.230
The counters are at the bottom of the output.
1724.190
So A, show interfaces, is correct.
1727.250
Let’s go to question 4.
1731.450
Which are examples of errors that might occur on a network interface?
1735.520
A, runts, giants, broadcasts.
1739.560
B, shorts, longs, oversizes.
1743.590
C, packets, bytes, inputs, outputs.
1748.630
D, runts, giants, CRC.
1752.670
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1759.080
The answer is D, runts, giants, CRC.
1763.730
The names in B and C are not real errors that can occur on an interface.
1769.390
In option A, runts and giants are possible errors, but broadcasts are not errors, they
1775.540
are part of normal network operations.
1778.679
So D, runts, giants, CRC, is the correct answer.
1783.830
Remember, Runts are frames that are too small, Giants are frames that are too big, and CRC
1792.080
counts the frames that failed their CRC check, which is done in the frame check sequence
1797.620
in the trailer of the ethernet frame.
1799.740
Let’s go to question 5.
1803.070
SW1 is trying to autonegotiate interface speed settings with SW2.
1809.800
However, autonegotiation is disabled on SW2’s interface.
1813.100
SW2’s interface is configured with a speed of 100 Mbps and full duplex.
1821.010
What speed and duplex settings will SW1 use?
1824.800
A, speed 100 megabits per second, duplex full.
1830.090
B, speed 100 megabits per second, duplex half.
1835.150
C, speed 10 megabits per second, duplex full.
1840.100
Or D, Speed 10 megabits per second, duplex half.
1844.880
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1850.740
The answer is B, speed 100 megabits per second, duplex half.
1856.050
If the remote device has autonegotiation disabled, but it's enabled on the local device, the local
1861.610
device will attempt to sense the speed the remote device is using, so SW1 will be able
1867.340
to correctly set its interface speed to 100 megabits per second to match SW2’s.
1872.800
However, it can't sense the duplex mode of SW2’s interface, so the rule is if the speed
1879.461
is 10 or 100 megabits per second, half duplex will be used, otherwise full duplex will be used.
1887.380
In this case, half duplex will be used, which will result in a duplex mismatch between the
1892.679
two devices, and probably poor performance on the link between them due to collisions.
1898.700
Okay, that’s all for the quiz.
1901.940
