welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab you can download the lab

file from the link in the description in

this lab we will once again be

troubleshooting the network topology

from lab number seven in the previous

lab number eight there was a single miss

configuration on r1 in this lab however

there is one miss configuration per

networking device meaning one on r1 one

on switch one and one on switch to try

to find and fix these errors on your own

first

then continue watching this video if you

have trouble or watch it after to check

your solution in the last video I showed

an example of how I would go about

troubleshooting a problem in this video

however I will just directly show the

Miss configurations and fix them so once

again try to troubleshoot on your own

first

so PC one can't ping the other pcs in

the network let's just check quickly on

PC one ping PC two ping 1000 dot 130

doesn't work ping pc3 ping 1000 three

doesn't work ping PC for ping 1000 131

doesn't work okay so let's fix the

problem on our one first enable show IP

interface brief look at the IP address

of the dot thirteen sub-interface 1000

da 11 now let's check the default

gateway of the pcs in VLAN 13 pc1 & pc2

c1 is 1000 dot one and PC three 1000 one

so this is a miss configuration let's

fix it back to our one County interface

g0 0.13 IP address 1000 dot one

255.255.255.192

next let's check switch 1 enable show

VLAN brief can you see the problem here

fastethernet 0/1 is in VLAN 12 it's

supposed to be in VLAN 13 let's change

that conf

interface f01 switch port access VLAN 13

ok switch 1 is now fixed finally let's

go to switch to enable show interfaces

trunk nothing appears the link between

switch 1 and switch two should be a

trunk so that it can carry traffic from

multiple VLANs so we have to fix this

conf T interface g0 1 switch port mode

trunk ok that should fix the problem

so let's test out our solution the

scenario stated that there was one miss

configuration on each device and we

fixed each one so PC one should now be

able to reach the other pcs so let's go

to PC 1 and pin PC to ping 1000 130 the

pin works next let's ping PC 3 pin 1000

3 okay it works

finally PC for ping 1000 131 it works as

well we have successfully fixed the

network
