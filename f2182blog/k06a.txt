welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab 
4.55934
you can download the lab

file from the link in the description 
8.883745
in

this lab we will be working with two

switches switch 1 and switch two 
15.59975
and

three pcs pc-1 pc2 and pc 3 
20.795037
you may

notice that the icons of these switches

are different than in the previous lab
26.536391
these are called multi-layer switches

because they can operate at both layer 2

and layer 3 of the OSI model 
34.089201
but we

won't actually be using their

multi-layer capabilities in this lab 
38.46917
I

selected this switch model for another

reason which will differentiate this lab

from the previous ones slightly in terms

of configuration 
46.90673
however the basic tasks

of the lab are the same 
50.847989
we will use

VLANs to separate these pcs at layer 2

even though they are in the same layer 3

subnet 
58.485622
try to complete the lab on your

own first then continue watching this

video if you have trouble or watch it

after to check your solution
67.200407
step one asks us to pin between the

computers to test connectivity 
74.748145
these

pings should all succeed 
77.018595
let's just ping

from pc1 
80.750219
first I'll ping PC two 
84.40899
ping 10.0.0.2
88.067075
 the ping works 
90.140269
next out ping pc3
93.193188
ping 10.0.0.3 
95.850549
 it works as well
98.711574
step two is to assign PC to and PC three

to VLAN two 
106.87117
again this is done by

configuring the switch interfaces
110.251923
let's do switch one first 
113.105264
enable conf t

pc 2 is connected to Fast Ethernet 0 3
121.208965
so interface F 0 3 
124.902216
switch port mode

access switch port access VLAN 2
130.497044
 that's

it for PC2
132.950304
 now let's do the same on

switch 2
135.489322
 enable conf t
140.885298
 interface F 0 2

switch port mode access switch port

access VLAN 2
148.473154
 ok

step 2 is complete
151.017034
step three is to create a trunk

connection between switch 1 and switch

2
159.81111
 remember that by default switch ports

are access ports in the native VLAN 
165.28844
VLAN

1 in order for these switches to carry

traffic from VLAN 2 as well 
171.072763
so that PC 2

and PC 3 can communicate with each other
174.728609
we need to create a trunk 
176.56515
let's do

switch 1 first 
178.840799
interface f0 1 
182.544391
switch

port mode trunk 
185.346055
but it doesn't work
186.890595
command rejected an interface whose

trunk encapsulation is auto cannot be

configured to trunk mode 
194.225705
this didn't

happen last lab 
196.736821
and actually this is why

I chose this switch model 
199.70376
when you make

a trunk link packets are encapsulated to

label them as part of a particular VLAN
206.496652
on the switches in the previous lab only

one type of encapsulation is available
211.483395

so there is no need to configure which

type of encapsulation to use 
215.530344
however

some models support two types of

encapsulation 
219.607772
one known as ISL which is

Cisco proprietary 
223.577219
and one known as 802.1

Q or dot1q
228.288559
which is an industry standard 
229.669872
dot1q is

by far the most common encapsulation

type 
234.516813
and lets configure this interface

to use dot1q 
237.650697
since we need to configure

the encapsulation type to create a trunk
241.416636
we do that with this command 
244.17984
switch port

trunk encapsulation dot1q 
249.6192
now we can

make the trunk link 
252.557067
switch port mode

trunk 
254.98895
now let's do the same commands on

switch2 
258.766149
interface f01 switch port

trunk encapsulation dot1q 
267.555151
switch port

mode trunk 
269.761237
that's all for step 3
272.344719
step four is to once again ping to test

connectivity 
279.438259
if everything is configured

correctly 
282.277329
PC - and PC 3 should be able

to pin each other 
285.790465
because they are both

in VLAN 2 
288.173147
and we have a trunk connection

between the two switches 
290.802586
they should not

be able to ping PC one or vice versa
294.716656
because PC one is still in the native

VLAN VLAN one 
298.613961
I'll use PC one first 
302.427273
ping

10.0.0.2 
306.359589
 doesn't work
309.207317
next ping 10.0.0.3 
314.216827
doesn't work as

expected
316.795943
now let's just try a ping between PC 2

and PC three 
321.746979
I'll go on PC 2 
324.311338
ping 10.0.0.3 
329.38028
the ping works as expected
331.747561
that's all for this lab
