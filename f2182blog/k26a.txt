description 14.976834 this lab will be the last of
our labs focused on static routing 20.790838 in
this lab we will configure a backup
static route known as a floating static
route on r1 27.432261 all routers are
pre-configured with the routing protocol
RIP pronounced  rip 33.507073 we haven't done
any labs on routing protocols yet 37.075822 but
rip configuration will be coming soon 39.730615 we
will configure r one with a floating
static route so that in the event that
it's s30 interface fails 46.726244 it will use the
s20 interface instead to reach the 10.0.0.0
slash 24 network 52.365734 try to complete the lab
yourself first then continue watching if
you have trouble or watch the video
after to check your solution 60.273923 so as it
says in the lab the routing protocol rip
is configured everywhere 66.386193 except between
r1 and r3 meaning it's not activated for
the s20 interfaces of r1 and r3 73.895002 however
our goal is to configure what's called a
floating static route 78.744987 which will cause
r1 to send traffic destined to the 10.0.0.0
slash 24 network 84.884970 using its s20 interface
86.971420 when it's read via r3 goes down 89.133642 we
actually only need one command to
complete this lab 93.558270 but let me explain
some things first 95.730565 if you have already
learned these things in your studies
this can just be a review 100.010734 let me go on
r1
102.886428 enable show IP route 107.456067 there are two
connected routes the 192.168.12.0 and
192.168.13.0
networks 116.074488 r1 has also learned two routes
from rip 119.670602 as indicated by the are here
121.907877 one is the 192.168.33.0 network 126.019587 which
are too advertised 127.961038 look right next to
the address 129.957597 there are two numbers here
in square brackets 132.848276 1 20
/ 1 what do these numbers mean 137.801715 first
the one this is known as the metric 141.559468 the
metric depends on the routing protocols
such as AI EGRP OSPF or rip 147.642080 rip uses hop
count to calculate the metric 151.324778 the metric
of one here indicates one hop 155.665442 as we can
rich reach it by a single router hop
over to r2 161.036964 to which it is a directly
connected network 163.463764 now look at the entry
for the 10.0.0.0 network 167.853265 its metric is 2
that is because there are 2 router hops
to reach it 172.841197 first to r2 then to r3 to
which it is a directly connected network
178.063486 lower the metric the more desirable the
route 182.180670 but there is one factor of higher
priority than the metric 186.031687 that is the
administrative distance 188.480863 which is the
number to the left of the metric 190.613963 in both
cases it is 120 193.329767 because that is the
default metric of a route learned from
rip 196.616794 because the administrative distance
is higher priority than the metric 201.724357 if a
router learns multiple possible routes
to a destination 205.436682 it first compares the
administrative distances 208.503490 and chooses the
lowest distance route to put in the
routing table 211.993692 only if the administrative
distances are the same does it compare
the metrics 217.534133 now I said rip has an
administrative distance of 120 223.201439 how about
if we create a normal static route
226.576376 let's try conf t let's create a static
route to the 10.0.0.0 network 233.987031 IP route 10.0.0.0
255.255.255.0 192.168.13.3 - next table to r3
246.643488 do show IP route
well now the route to 10.0.0.0 learned via
rip isn't displayed in the routing table
257.263647 it has been replaced with our static
route because it has a lower
administrative distance 263.328470 the default
administrative distance of a static
route is 1
267.437197 as you can see here 269.069368 so have we completed
the lab no our instructions are to
configure what's called a floating
static rift 278.055467 that is a static route which
is only entered into the routing table
281.463454 when the regular route is not available
283.900539 such as when an interface goes down 286.211522 how
can we do that
288.265679 well when configuring a static route we
can also specify the administrative
distance for that route 294.749540 if we specify an
administrative distance higher than that
of the RIP route 299.132671 the static route will
not appear in the routing table and thus
not be used 303.736737 unless we stop receiving the
RIP route from r 2 306.261395 do to an interface
failure or something
308.766602 so let's undo our static route by
putting no in front of the command 313.834846 now
let's use the command at gain 318.967240 and here
I'll use the context-sensitive help
question mark 323.014629 and you can see we can set
the distance of the route 326.727565 the
administrative distance of RIP is 120 330.635987 so
let's just set it to one higher 121 okay
335.882735 now let's check the routing table again
338.200772 do show IP route 340.151464 this time the static
route is not displayed
343.670919 let's use the traceroute command to
ensure that it is still taking the path
through r2 to r3 354.009059 we haven't used the
traceroute command yet in these labs 357.149610 but
it's very useful 358.752076 it's like the ping
command but it sends a reply back from
each router on the way to its
destination 364.705773 so you can trace the path it
takes through the network

367.614195 


I'll trace to PC one do trace route 10.0.0.0
11 as you can see it is indeed going to
r2 before going to r3 and then ending up
at PC one now let's simulate an
interphase error I'll turn off the s30
interface which is connected to our two
interface s30 shutdown okay now do show
IP route our rip routes are gone however
immediately the floating static route
which we configured takes the place of
the previous route to 10.0.0.0 let's try a
trace route from router 1 to PC 1 again
do trace route 10.0.0.0 11 this time it goes
straight to r3 and then ends up at PC 11
I'm sorry PC 1 our floating static route
is functioning exactly as intended now
let's turn on this interface again no
shutdown
what do you think will happen it can
take a bit of time but hopefully as I'm
talking the process will finish
currently art 2 is regularly sending rip
advertisements of its route to 10.0.0.0 to
r1 now that our ones s30 interface is up
again when r1 receives one of those
advertisements on the interface it will
replace the floating static route in the
routing table with the route learned by
rip because the administrative distance
of RIP is 120 and the floating static
route we configured has an ad of 121
okay let's check do show IP route
as you can see the floating static route
is gone and now the RIP route is back in
the routing table
I hope this lab helped you understand a
little about administrative distance and
floating static routes soon we will do
more labs focusing on routing protocols
like ew grpe and OSPF and also rip which
we saw a little in this lab that's all
