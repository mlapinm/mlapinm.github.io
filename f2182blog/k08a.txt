in

this lab we will be working with the

same network topology as in the previous

lab lab number seven 
15.772173
in which we

configured inter VLAN routing with the

router on a stick method 
19.897418
this time

however the configurations are all

completed the task this time is to

troubleshoot a configuration error and

fix it troubleshooting is an important

skill to have for your CCENT and CCNA

exams and also of course in real-world

situations because problems will

inevitably come up try to complete this

lab on your own first

then continue watching this video if you

have trouble or watch it after to check

your solution remember the exact method

you use to troubleshoot doesn't have to

match mine as long as the end result is

that you solve the problem so this is

our scenario we have 4 pcs with pc1 &

pc2 being in VLAN 13 and pc 2 and pc for

being in VLAN 24 someone has configured

inter VLAN routing to allow these pcs to

communicate with each other but

evidently there is some problem

preventing them from doing so

in a troubleshooting scenario like this

we should first confirm the problem if I

send pings from pc1 I shouldn't be able

to ping PC to in PC for the scenario

doesn't mention that computers in the

same VLAN can't communicate so pc1 & pc2

should be able to ping each other

likewise PC 2 shouldn't be able to ping

PC 1 or PC 3 but should be able to ping

pc 4 let's test I'll use PC 1 first

first ping PC to ping 1000 130 doesn't

work next ping pc3 ping 1000 3 the ping

works next PC for ping 1000 131 doesn't

work ok let's try from PC to as well

paying PC 1 first ping 1000 2 doesn't

work next PC 3 ping 1003 doesn't work

finally PC for paying 1000 131 it works

so we have confirmed the problem

computers in the same VLAN can

communicate but our inter VLAN routing

isn't working

because we are using r1 to route between

subnets providing our inter VLAN routing

it's probably a good idea to look around

the link between switch 1 and r1

first let's check on switch 1 enable

let's check if the gig 0 1 interface is

down show IP interface brief nope as you

can see it is up and up perhaps the gig

0 1 interface isn't configured as a

trunk now we could use show run to check

but for exam purposes as well as real

world purposes it's important to know

other commands to let's use the show

interfaces trunk command as you can see

both of our trunks are working and

allowing all the VLANs that we are using

let's head over to r1 and check things

out

enable show IP interface brief looks

like the interface is up and the IP

addresses are configured as 1000 dot one

for VLAN 13 and 1000 dot 1 to 9 for VLAN

24 these IP addresses should be

configured on the PCs as their default

gateway let's quickly check each PC to

make sure on PC one ipconfig /all looks

good

next on PC to ipconfig /all looks good

as well

PC 3 ipconfig /all looks good

finally on PC 4 ipconfig /all no

problems here now let's go back to our

one perhaps there is a different miss

configuration on the sub interfaces

remember we had to configure the VLAN

before the IP address on these sub

interfaces in the previous lab let's

check again show run is always an option

but let's do this show interface g0 0.13

VLAN ID 13 that's correct

next show interface g0 0.24 VLAN ID 14

looks like we found the problem there is

no VLAN 14 on the network this is

supposed to be VLAN 24 let's go fix that

comte interface g0 0.24 encapsulation

dot1q 24 ok that should solve the

problem a configuration error like this

could very well be a simple typo always

be sure to

your configurations carefully in your

exams and in real-world situations

have to check that our network actually

works with inter VLAN routing now

properly configured all four pcs should

be able to ping each other let's hop on

PC one again

first let's ping PC to ping 1000 130 the

ping works then pc 3 ping 1000 dot 3 it

works again next PC for paying 1000 131

the ping works

looks like our problem is solved just to

be sure I'll send some pings from PC to

as well paint 1000 dot - it works ping

1000 dot 3 it works

ping 1000 won 3-1 it works as well we

have successfully fixed the network
