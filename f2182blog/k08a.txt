you can download the lab file from the link in the description

in this lab we will be working with the same network topology as in the previous lab lab number seven
15.772173
in which we configured inter VLAN routing with the router on a stick method
19.897418
this time however the configurations are all completed
24.038867
the task this time is to troubleshoot a configuration error and fix it
27.62313
troubleshooting is an important skill to have for your CCENT and CCNA exams and also of course in real-world situations
35.951555
because problems will inevitably come up
38.553251
try to complete this lab on your own first
41.59053
then continue watching this video if you have trouble
44.600378
or watch it after to check your solution
47.166952
remember the exec method you use to troubleshoot doesn't have to match mine
51.712714
as long as the end result is that you solve the problem
55.038719
so this is our scenario
58.49551
we have 4 pcs with pc1 & pc2 being in VLAN 13
64.03647
and pc 2 and pc 4 being in VLAN 24
67.407514
someone has configured inter VLAN routing to allow these pcs to communicate with each other
73.184728
but evidently there is some problem preventing them from doing so
77.534174
in a troubleshooting scenario like this we should first confirm the problem
84.845038
if I send pings from pc1
88.490893
I shouldn't be able to ping PC to in PC 4
91.468093
the scenario doesn't mention that computers in the same VLAN can't communicate so pc1 & pc2 should be able to ping each other
99.618049
likewise PC 2 shouldn't be able to ping PC 1 or PC 3
104.654089
but should be able to ping pc 4
107.132281
let's test
108.27213
I'll use PC 1 first
110.595281
first ping PC 2
114.406025
ping 10.0.0.1 30
118.348466
doesn't work
121.500662
next ping pc3 ping 10.0.0.3 the ping works
128.784392
next PC 4 ping 10.0.0.1 31 doesn't work
136.707317
ok let's try from PC to as well
140.665913
ping PC 1 first ping 10.0.0.2 doesn't work
149.994881
next PC 3 ping 10.0.0.3 doesn't work
157.333417
finally PC 4 ping 10.0.0.1 31 it works
164.75137
so we have confirmed the problem
166.875221
computers in the same VLAN can communicate but our inter VLAN routing isn't working
172.305115
because we are using r1 to route between subnets
179.489856
providing our inter VLAN routing it's probably a good idea to look around the link between switch 1 and r1
185.419378
first let's check on switch 1
188.329445
enable let's check if the gig 0 1 interface is down
194.776753
show IP interface brief
197.418102
nope as you can see it is up and up
202.009911
perhaps the gig 0 1 interface isn't configured as a trunk
206.058783
now we could use show run to check
210.699182
but for exam purposes as well as real world purposes
214.039957
it's important to know other commands too
216.817516
let's use the show interfaces trunk command
221.120992
as you can see both of our trunks are working and allowing all the VLANs that we are using
229.007535
let's head over to r1 and check things out
239.005101
enable show IP interface brief
243.106631
looks like the interface is up and the IP addresses are configured as 10.0.0.1 for VLAN 13
251.15149
and 10.0.0.1 to 9 for VLAN 24
254.869647
these IP addresses should be configured on the PCs as their default gateway
261.073869
let's quickly check each PC to make sure
264.589187
on PC one ipconfig /all
271.396973
looks good
272.600487
next on PC 2
274.872318
ipconfig /all looks good as well
281.175486
PC 3 ipconfig /all looks good
289.49705
finally on PC 4 ipconfig /all no problems here
298.843391
now let's go back to our one
301.770768
perhaps there is a different miss configuration on the sub interfaces
306.739163
remember we had to configure the VLAN before the IP address on these sub interfaces in the previous lab
314.051305
let's check again show run is always an option but let's do this
319.389883
show interface g0 0.13
324.800502
VLAN ID 13 that's correct
329.019162
next show interface g0 0.24 VLAN ID 14
337.915217
looks like we found the problem
341.257255
there is no VLAN 14 on the network
343.22351
this is supposed to be VLAN 24
345.645814
let's go fix that
347.624844
conf t interface g0 0.24 encapsulation dot1q 24
358.39565
ok that should solve the problem
360.818604
a configuration error like this could very well be a simple typo
365.520263
always be sure to your configurations carefully in your exams and in real-world situations
370.892092
have to check that our network actually works
380.546927
with inter VLAN routing now properly configured
383.748189
all four pcs should be able to ping each other
386.357837
let's hop on PC one again
389.163487
first let's ping PC 2
391.676036
ping 10.0.0.1 30 the ping works
396.479051
then pc 3 ping 10.0.0.3 it works again
402.634568
next PC 4 paying 10.0.0.1 31 the ping works
409.658427
looks like our problem is solved
411.817894
just to be sure I'll send some pings from PC 2 as well
414.977687
ping 10.0.0.2 it works ping 10.0.0.3 it works
425.727168
ping 10.0.0.1 31 it works as well
431.97908
we have successfully fixed the network
