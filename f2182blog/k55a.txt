lab we will expand upon what we did in

the previous lab I have added an

additional router change the IP

addresses and we will configure multi

area OSPF the middle area is area 0 also

known as the backbone all other areas

must be attached to the backbone area

and traffic from one area to another

must pass through the backbone 2 of our

routers our area border routers or ABR's

because they have interfaces in multiple

areas r2 has interfaces in area 0 and

area 1 and our 3 has interfaces in area

0 and area 2 let's get started I'll

configure these routers in order from 1

to 5 make sure you configure the

interfaces in the proper areas also we

should configure the loopback interfaces

as passive interfaces and configure the

reference bandwidth so that a 100

gigabit interface would have a cost of 1

let's go on our one an able coffee tea

router OSPF 1 remember the OSPF process

ID doesn't have to match between routers

in the last lab I purposefully

configured a different process ID on

each router in this lab however I'll do

the typical thing and just use a process

ID of one for each router ok now our

ones interfaces are all in a single area

so I'll use our shortcut from last time

Network oh-oh-oh-oh 255 255 dot 255 255

area 1 now OSPF is activated on all

interfaces with an IP address let's make

the loopback passive passive interface

l0 finally the reference bandwidth Auto

cost reference bandwidth now what should

the value B we should configure it to be

equivalent to 100 gigabits per second

that's 100,000 megabits per second so

configure the reference bandwidth as

100,000 okay that's all for r1 now I'll

go through the rest of these devices

fairly quickly again make sure to

configure the correct interfaces in the

correct areas for routers 2 & 3 the loop

backs could be in either area but the

instructions say to put them in area 0

let's go on our to an able Conti router

OSPF one network 10.12 oh oh oh oh oh

255 area one I configure the same slash

24 mask as on the interface but remember

that a slash 16 would work as well a

slash 8 would not work however because

10000 / 8 includes f2 0 also which has

to be in a different area okay let's

continue Network 10.23 oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

255 area 0 network 2 2 to 200 200 area 0

passive interface l0 auto cost reference

bandwidth 100000 okay next is r3 enable

compte router OSPF one network 10.23

oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 255 area 0 network 10.35

oo ooo 255 area to network three three

three three zero zero zero area zero

passive interface l0

auto cost reference bandwidth 100,000

okay next is our four enable conf T

Network oh oh oh oh 255.255.255.0 v

aerial 1 passive interface l 0 auto cost

reference bandwidth 100,000 okay last

router our 5 enable coughed T router

OSPF one our five is only part of area 2

so let's use this shortcut again network

oh-oh-oh-oh 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 255

area 2 passive interface L 0 auto cost

reference bandwidth 100000 that's all

for step 1 now step 2 is to configure

route summarization on the ABR's

here on our 5 let me show you the route

table do show IP route we have all of

these routes 10.12 0 10.14 0 10.20 300

but our 5 only has one path to them so

our three could instead advertise a

single 10.0 / 8 route to our 5 and it

would help clean up our 5s routing table

this isn't a very large network but in

very large networks this is very

beneficial let's configure that on our 3

we want to summarize these routes are 3

is receiving an area 0 so we begin the

command with area 0 not with area 1 the

area to which we will advertise the

summary ok next to the keyword range

then the address 10000 followed by the

mask 255 0 keep in mind that this is not

a wildcard mask that's easy to mix up

since the network command uses a

wildcard mask

so if we go and check on r5 instead of

having learned routes to 10.23 0/24

10.12 0/24 and 10.14 0/24 it should have

a single 10000 / 8th route learned via

OSPF however the loop backs don't fit in

the summary so they will be unchanged

okay let's go check our 5s route table

do show IP route there we go our 5 has

learned a single route to all of the

routes that fit within the 10000 / 8

range of course it still has its

directly connected network of 10.35 0/24

here now let's configure the same thing

on r2 r1 and r4 don't need to learn

about that 10.23 0/24

and 10.35 0.0 /horizontalscale the

routing tables of r1 and r4 we shouldn't

see routes to 10.20 300 / 24 and 10.35

0/24 but rather a summary 10000 / 8

address keep in mind it can take a few

seconds for the network to converge and

this changed to show in the routing

table but let's check on our for do show

IP route there we go there's that 1000 /

8 summary in this lab we looked at multi

area

OSPF we could have more areas area 3

area for area 5 etc but remember that

all areas must

connect to the backbone area area zero

we also used summarization to reduce the

size of our routing table which is

highly recommended in large networks
