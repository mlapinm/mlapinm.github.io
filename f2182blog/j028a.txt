Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,539
So, today’s topic is another big one.

8
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,750
Today’s topic is VLANs.

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:29,439
VLAN stands for Virtual LAN, Virtual Local
Area Network.

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,090
It’s very important that you understand
VLANs well for your CCNA exam, and certainly

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,370
when working as a network engineer.

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,300
So, feel free to ask any questions if you
don’t understand.

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,920
Here are the topics we will cover in today’s
video.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,859
First, what is a LAN?

15
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:54,570
We know it stands for Local Area Network,
but I’ll give you a more specific definition.

16
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:01,079
To help understand LANs and VLANs, we will
also look at broadcast domains.

17
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,369
After looking at LANs and broadcast domains,
I will introduce you to VLANs, virtual LANs.

18
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:10,710
I will teach you the basics of VLANs, and
their purpose.

19
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,560
Finally, we will look at the basics of VLAN
configuration on Cisco switches.

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,119
By the way, this won’t be the only video
on VLANs, the next video, Day 17, will also

21
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:25,710
be on VLANs, so this video will just cover
the basics.

22
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,979
Let’s get started.

23
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:30,550
So, what is a LAN?

24
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:36,340
In a previous video, I said that a LAN is
a group of devices (PCs, servers, routers,

25
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,719
switches, etc.) in a single location, for example a home or office.

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:49,240
Let’s take a look at a more specific definition:
A LAN is a single broadcast domain.

27
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,240
A broadcast domain is the group of devices
which will receive a broadcast frame (that

28
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:59,590
is, a frame with a destination MAC of all Fs)
sent by any one of the members.

29
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,389
Let’s take a look at a diagram.

30
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:06,530
So, take a look at this network here.

31
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,429
How many broadcast domains do you think there
are?

32
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:14,879
Remember, a broadcast domain includes all
devices that will receive a broadcast frame.

33
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,500
So, let’s say PC1 sends a broadcast frame,
and remember that a broadcast frame is a frame

34
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,049
with a destination MAC Address of all Fs.

35
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:27,500
Which devices will receive the frame?

36
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:34,599
Well, this PC1 sends the frame out towards
SW1, and what does a switch do with a broadcast

37
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,659
frame?

38
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:39,599
It floods it out all interfaces, except the
one it was received on.

39
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,269
So, the frame is sent to PC2 and R1.

40
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:47,000
What does a router do with a broadcast frame?

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,439
It doesn’t forward it.

42
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:52,049
It will receive the frame, but it won’t
send it to other networks.

43
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:59,880
So, that means this is one broadcast domain,
including PC1, PC2, SW1, and one of R1’s

44
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
interfaces.

45
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,170
So, that’s one broadcast domain.

46
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,129
How many are left?

47
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:10,810
What if PC3 sends a broadcast frame, which
devices will receive it?

48
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:17,870
SW2 will receive the frame and flood it out
of all interfaces, to R1, PC4, and PC5.

49
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,230
R1, however, will not forward the broadcast
frame.

50
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:31,150
So, that’s the broadcast domain, PC3, PC4,
PC5, SW2, and one of R1’s interfaces.

51
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,790
So far, we have found 2 broadcast domains.

52
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:40,569
Now, how about if PC6 sends a broadcast frame,
which devices will receive it?

53
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:45,950
When SW3 receives it, it will flood the frame
to PC7, PC8, and R2.

54
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,329
And R2 will not forward the frame.

55
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:56,319
So, this is the broadcast domain, including
PC6, 7,8, SW3, and one of R2’s interfaces.

56
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,640
So, we’ve found three broadcast domains
so far.

57
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,340
However, there is one more.

58
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,620
What if R1 sends a broadcast frame out of
its interface which is connected to R2?

59
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,319
It will be received only by R2.

60
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:15,800
However, even though this is a connection with only two devices, it is still

61
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,510
technically a broadcast domain.

62
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,940
So, do you understand what a broadcast domain
is now?

63
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,200
A broadcast domain is the group of devices
which will receive a broadcast frame (with a destination

64
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,170
MAC address of all Fs) sent by any one of the
members.

65
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:40,010
In this network here, there are four broadcast
domains, and therefore four LANs.

66
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,190
Here is a small LAN of a company.

67
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:48,360
Let’s say there are three main departments
in this office, engineering, sales, and human

68
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,500
resources.

69
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:56,390
Also, the company is using the 192.168.1.0/24
network for this LAN.

70
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,030
However, this isn’t necessarily the best
setup.

71
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:05,160
For both security and performance purposes,
it would be best to split up these into separate

72
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,170
subnets.

73
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:12,610
For example let’s say a PC in the engineering department
sends a broadcast message intended for other

74
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,470
PCs in the engineering department.

75
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:20,080
Since it’s a broadcast message, the switch
will flood it out of all interfaces.

76
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,190
So, not only will the PCs in the engineering
department receive the broadcast, ALL PCs,

77
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,550
as well as the router, will receive the broadcast.

78
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:34,470
This is a problem, for both security and network
performance purposes.

79
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:40,910
When it comes to performance, lots of unnecessary
broadcast traffic can reduce network performance.

80
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,840
Whether it’s a broadcast from one end host,
or a switch that doesn’t know how to reach the

81
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,100
destination MAC address so it floods the frame,
we should minimize unnecessary traffic in

82
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,330
our network.

83
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:58,880
As for security, Even within the same office,
you want to limit who has access to what.

84
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,440
You can apply security policies on a router or firewall.

85
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,310
Because this is one LAN, PCs can reach each
other directly, without traffic passing through

86
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,310
the router.

87
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:15,050
So, even if you configure security policies on the router,
they won’t have any effect.

88
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,380
We should separate these hosts so we can apply
security policies that determine who can access

89
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,130
what in the network.

90
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:25,800
So, let’s split up these departments into
separate subnets.

91
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:37,100
192.168.1.0/26 for the ENGINEERING department,
192.168.1.64/26 for the HR department, and

92
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,800
192.168.1.128/26 for the SALES department.

93
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,110
However, there’s one problem.

94
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,900
The router is going to need an IP address
in each subnet, so it will need one interface

95
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,220
in each subnet.

96
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,370
So, let’s replace this single connection
between the switch and router with three separate

97
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,540
connections, one in each subnet.

98
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,820
Actually, there is a more efficient way of
doing this, you don’t actually have to use

99
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,560
three separate interfaces, but don’t worry
about that for now, I will cover that in a

100
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,130
future video.

101
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,450
So, you may think the problem is solved now.

102
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:20,970
Let’s say this PC in the ENGINEERING department
has an IP address of 192.168.1.1, and this

103
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:27,930
PC in the SALES department has an IP address
of 192.168.1.129.

104
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:34,250
If PC1 sends some data to PC2, PC1 will recognize
that PC2 is in a different subnet than its

105
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:40,690
own, so it will set the destination MAC address
to its default gateway, R1.

106
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:48,190
This is what the frame will look like, Source
IP of PC1, destination IP of PC2, source MAC

107
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,960
of PC1, and destination MAC of R1.

108
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,710
PC1 will forward the frame to the switch,
which will send it to R1, which will then

109
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:03,330
change the source MAC to its own MAC, and
the destination MAC to PC2’s MAC.

110
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:08,250
It will then forward the frame back to the
switch, which will then forward it to the destination,

111
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,360
PC2.

112
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,370
Okay, so instead of PC1 being able to send
traffic directly to PC2, we forced it to send

113
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:20,060
the traffic through R1 first, where we would
have configured some security policies and

114
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,970
such to control exactly what traffic is allowed
to pass between these subnets.

115
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,550
However, there is still a problem.

116
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,780
Here’s the problem.

117
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,879
What if the frame is a broadcast or unknown
unicast frame?

118
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:37,729
The switch will flood the frame out of all
interfaces.

119
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:40,689
For example, here’s a broadcast frame.

120
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:47,910
The source IP is PC1’s IP, and the destination
IP is its subnet’s broadcast address.

121
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,940
So, this is a broadcast frame intended to
the engineering department.

122
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:59,670
The source MAC is PC1’s, and the destination
is the broadcast MAC address of all F’s.

123
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,870
Where is the problem?

124
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,920
Well, remember that a switch is only aware
up to Layer 2.

125
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,490
It looks at Layer 2 information like source and
destination MAC addresses only.  It doesn’t

126
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,050
care about Layer 3, 4, etc.

127
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:19,850
So, even though there are three separate subnets
here the switch doesn’t know that.

128
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,620
PC1 will send the frame to the switch, it
will see the destination MAC address of all

129
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,920
Fs, and then flood the frame.

130
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,649
I’ll say it again, this is bad in terms of
both network performance and security.

131
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:38,649
So, I’ve shown you that although we separated
the three departments into three subnets,

132
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:43,839
meaning they are separated at Layer 3, they
are still in the same broadcast domain, the

133
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,870
same Layer 2 network, or the same LAN.

134
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:52,220
Now, one possible solution is to buy a separate
switch for each department.

135
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:57,779
However, that is not very flexible, and network
equipment isn’t cheap, so buying one or

136
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:02,600
more switches for every single department
could be too expensive, especially for a small

137
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,930
enterprise.

138
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,480
However, this is where VLANs come in.

139
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,810
Although these PCs are all in the same LAN,
Local Area Network, we can use VLANs, or Virtual

140
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,579
Local Area Networks, to separate them at Layer
2.

141
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:25,720
We’ll assign the ENGINEERING department
to VLAN10, the HR department to VLAN20, and

142
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,139
the SALES department to VLAN30.

143
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:32,350
How exactly to we assign these hosts to VLANs?

144
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,819
We configure them on the switch.

145
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:38,249
More specifically, on the switch interfaces.

146
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:43,279
You configure the switch interface to be in
a specific VLAN, and then the end host connected

147
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,680
to that interface is part of that VLAN.

148
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,680
The switch will consider each VLAN as a separate
LAN, and will not forward traffic between

149
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,160
VLANs, including broadcast or unknown unicast
traffic.

150
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,439
So, if we have set up these VLANs, if PC1
sends this same broadcast frame, after the

151
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:08,820
frame arrives at the switch, it will be forwarded
to all interfaces IN THE SAME VLAN.

152
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,560
Because the broadcast arrived on an interface
configured in VLAN10, the switch will only

153
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,949
forward the frame to other interfaces in VLAN10.

154
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:24,500
If PC1 wants sends this same unicast frame
to PC2, it will function just like before.

155
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,290
It sends it to the switch, which sends it
to the router, which changes the source and

156
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:35,870
destination MAC addresses, and sends it back to
the switch, which sends it to the destination.

157
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,290
Notice that the router is used to route between
VLANs.

158
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,550
The switch does not perform this 'inter-VLAN routing'.

159
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,140
It must send the traffic through the router.

160
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:53,080
Notice, traffic arrives on a VLAN10
interface is forwarded out of a VLAN10 interface.

161
00:11:53,080 --> 00:12:02,040
Also, traffic that arrives on a VLAN30 interface
is forwarded out of a VLAN30 interface.  Both in the same VLAN.

162
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,100
A switch will never forward traffic directly
between two VLANs like this.

163
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,889
Well, first of all, the two hosts are in separate
subnets, so PC1 itself will send the traffic

164
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:14,839
to its default gateway, R1.

165
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:20,110
However, even if PC1 and PC2 were in the same
subnet, the switch wouldn’t forward the

166
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:26,319
traffic from PC1 to PC2, because they are
in separate VLANs.

167
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:27,610
Just a bit of review.

168
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:32,990
VLANs are configured on switches on a per-interface
basis.

169
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,940
VLANs logically separate end hosts at Layer
2.

170
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,189
Although the hosts in the topology we looked
at were physically connected to the same switch,

171
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:46,300
and therefore in the same broadcast domain,
we used VLANs to logically separate them,

172
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,930
and put them in separate broadcast domains.

173
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,339
Switches do not forward traffic directly between
hosts in different VLANs.

174
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:58,279
As I showed you, the switch must forward the
traffic to a router.

175
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:03,189
Actually, there are a couple other methods
of inter-VLAN routing, and I will cover them

176
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:04,910
in a future video.

177
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:09,550
Finally, let’s take a look at basic VLAN
configuration.

178
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:18,139
I’ve added the interface numbers to the
diagram, interfaces in VLAN10 are G1/0 through

179
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:27,740
G1/3.  Interfaces in VLAN2 are G2/0 through
G2/2.  And interfaces in VLAN30 are G3/0 through

180
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,120
G3/3.

181
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,000
Let’s go into the CLI and put these interfaces
into the proper VLANs.

182
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,589
Before configuration, lets look at the VLANs
that exist by default on a switch.

183
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:45,059
In this output, you can see I used the command
SHOW VLAN BRIEF.

184
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:50,160
It displays the VLANs that exist on the switch,
and which interfaces are in each VLAN.

185
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,769
Here, you can see VLAN1, with the name DEFAULT.

186
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:58,140
This is the VLAN that all interfaces are assigned
to by default.

187
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:04,820
So, even if you don’t configure any VLANs,
all interfaces are in VLAN1 by default.

188
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:12,100
Under ports you can see all of the interfaces
on this device, from G0/0 to G3/3.

189
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:18,910
Under it are four other VLANs, 1002 to 1005,
used for FDDI and token ring.

190
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:23,410
These are old technologies that you don’t
need to know for the CCNA, but feel free to

191
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,529
google them if you’re curious.

192
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:34,579
VLANS 1 and 1002-1005 exist by default and
cannot be deleted, remember that!

193
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:37,430
This is how you assign interfaces to a VLAN.

194
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:43,050
First, I used the interface range command
to configure all of the VLAN 10 interfaces

195
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,050
at once.

196
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:51,070
Use the SWITCHPORT MODE ACCESS command to
set the interface as an access port.

197
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,160
What is an access port?

198
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,820
An access port is a switchport which belongs
to a single VLAN, and usually connects to

199
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,200
end hosts like PCs.

200
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:06,100
That’s why it’s called an ACCESS port,
it gives the end hosts ACCESS to the network.

201
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,640
There is another important type of switchport
called a trunk port.

202
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,740
Switchports which carry multiple VLANs are
called ‘trunk ports’.

203
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,790
I will cover trunk ports in depth in the next
video, but for today’s video we will focus

204
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,129
only on access ports, and take it step-by-step.

205
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:29,579
A switchport connected to an end host should
enter access mode by default, however it’s

206
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:34,410
always a good idea to explicitly configure
the setting and not rely on autonegotiation

207
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,360
of port type.

208
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:44,839
Anyway, the last command after SWITCHPORT
MODE ACCESS is SWITCHPORT ACCESS VLAN 10.

209
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,080
This is the command that actually assigns
the VLAN to the port.

210
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,499
Notice the message that appears after this
command.

211
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:52,499
%Access

212
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:54,850
VLAN does not exist.

213
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,009
Creating vlan 10.

214
00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:01,600
Because VLAN10 didn’t exist on the device
yet, it was created automatically when we

215
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,439
assigned the interface to VLAN10.

216
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:09,290
I’ll show you how to manually create a VLAN
in the next slide.

217
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,800
Next, I again used the interface range command
to configure all of the VLAN20 interfaces

218
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,389
at once.

219
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:21,300
I used the same SWITCHPORT MODE ACCESS command,
then SWITCHPORT ACCESS VLAN 20 to assign the

220
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,339
interfaces to VLAN 20.

221
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:30,389
Finally, I did the same for VLAN30, and once
again the VLAN was created automatically.

222
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:37,060
So, I used the show vlan brief command once
again, and here you can see the three VLANs

223
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,449
we created, and the ports we assigned to each
VLAN.

224
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:46,589
Notice the default names of each VLAN, let’s
change those to make it more understandable.

225
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:52,970
So, I used the VLAN 10 command to enter configuration
mode for VLAN 10.

226
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,560
By the way, this is the command to create
a VLAN, also.

227
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,040
But in this case, it was already automatically
created when we assigned the interfaces.

228
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:07,630
Next, I assign the name with this simple command,
NAME ENGINEERING.

229
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:13,850
Then I do the same for VLAN 20, HR, and vlan
30, SALES.

230
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:19,150
Finally, I confirmed once more with SHOW VLAN
BRIEF.

231
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,959
Notice that the names have been changed to
engineering, HR, and sales.

232
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,820
Okay, so that’s all for the configurations.

233
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:35,590
If I use the command PING 255.255.255.255
on PC1, which sends a ping with the destination

234
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:42,880
MAC address of all Fs, the broadcast MAC,
the broadcast will only reach hosts in VLAN10.

235
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:50,740
Likewise, if I use the same command on PC2,
the broadcast will only reach PCs in VLAN30.

236
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:57,460
Okay, so before moving on to today’s quiz
let’s review what we covered.

237
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,710
We talked about what a LAN is, and I defined
it as a broadcast domain, the group of devices

238
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:08,080
that will receive a broadcast frame sent by
another member in the group.

239
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,330
Then I talked about what a VLAN is.

240
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:15,430
It’s essentially a way to logically split
up a Layer 2 broadcast domain, to make multiple

241
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,550
separate broadcast domains.

242
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,430
We also talked about the purpose of VLANs.

243
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:26,070
The two big reasons are network performance
and security.

244
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:31,330
VLANs help to reduce unnecessary broadcast
traffic, which helps prevent network congestion

245
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,640
and therefore improve network performance.

246
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,240
Limiting broadcast and unknown unicast traffic
like this also improves network security,

247
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,420
since these messages won’t be received by
devices outside of the VLAN.

248
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:52,100
You should always make sure that network traffic
isn’t sent unnecessarily to other devices as much as possible.

249
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,560
Finally, we looked at how to configure VLANs
on Cisco switches.

250
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:01,790
Specifically, we configured access ports on
a Cisco switch and assigned them to a specific

251
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,300
VLAN.

252
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:08,140
There is still plenty to cover about VLANs,
but this should be a good foundation.

253
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,260
In day 17’s video we will cover more topics
regarding VLANs.

254
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,130
Okay, let’s go on to today’s quiz.

255
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,030
First up, question 1.

256
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,950
How many broadcast domains are shown in this

257
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,930
network diagram?

258
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,940
Pause the video and count how many broadcast
domains you see.

259
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:32,800
Note that no VLANs have been configured, so
all hosts are in the same default VLAN, VLAN1.

260
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:40,020
Pause the video now.

261
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,680
Okay, let’s check the answer.

262
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,380
There are 6 broadcast domains in this network
diagram.

263
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:53,480
Basically, each router interface and everything
connected to it are in one broadcast domain,

264
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,580
since no VLANs have been configured.

265
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,390
Let’s go to question 2.

266
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,980
How many broadcast domains are shown in this
network diagram?

267
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,520
Take note of the configured VLANs.

268
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,240
Pause the video to think about your answer.

269
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,080
OK, let’s check.

270
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,740
There are 5 broadcast domains here.

271
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,080
One for each of the configured VLANs, and
the connection between the two routers is

272
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,870
a broadcast domain as well.

273
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,030
Let’s go to question 3.

274
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:32,250
What happens if you try to assign a switch
interface to a VLAN that doesn’t exist?

275
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,720
A, the command will fail.

276
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,980
B, the switch will create the VLAN.

277
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:43,060
C, the interface will be disabled until you
create the VLAN.

278
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,900
Or D, all VLANs exist by default.

279
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:53,700
Pause the video to think about your answer.

280
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,590
Okay, the answer is B, the switch will create
the VLAN.

281
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,310
As I showed earlier in this video, if you
assign a switch interface to a VLAN that doesn’t

282
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,110
exist yet, the switch will create the VLAN
automatically.

283
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:10,900
Let’s go to question 4.

284
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,930
If PC3 sends a broadcast message, how many
devices will receive it?

285
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:21,440
Pause the video to think about your answer.

286
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,390
Okay, let’s check the answer.

287
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,540
The answer is 3.

288
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,780
First of all, the switch will receive it,
then it will send it out of all interfaces in

289
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:38,280
VLAN20, so the router and the other PC in
VLAN20, making a total of 3 devices.

290
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,480
If no VLANs were configured, ALL other PCs
would receive it, but since we have configured

291
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,570
VLANs, only these devices in the same VLAN
will receive it.

292
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:52,950
Let’s go to the final question, question
5.

293
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:58,020
You create VLANs 10, 20, and 30 on a Cisco
switch.

294
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:02,540
How many VLANs will be displayed in the output
of the show vlan brief command?

295
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,500
A, 3.

296
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,460
B, 5.

297
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,410
C, 8.

298
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,080
Or D, 10.

299
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,740
Pause the video to think about your answer.

300
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,980
The answer is C, 8.

301
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,610
Let’s check it out.

302
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,220
As you can see, there are 8 total VLANs.

303
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:30,140
VLANs 1, and 1002, 3, 4, and 5 exist by default
and cannot be deleted.

304
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:36,440
So, if you create three additonal VLANs, there
will be a total of 8 VLANs on the switch.

305
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,150
Okay, that’s all for the quiz.

306
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,750
There will be supplementary materials for
this video to help you review and practice

307
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,780
what you’ve learned.

308
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,900
There will be a flash card link in the video
description which you can use with the flashcard

309
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,620
software Anki to help you review.

310
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:57,200
There will also be a packet tracer practice
lab which you can use to practice the configurations

311
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,200
learned in this video.

312
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,570
That will be in a separate video.

313
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:08,210
Before I wrap up this video, I want to say
thank you so much to my JCNP-level channel members,

314
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:15,680
Yonatan, Mike, Aleksander, Vance, Magrathea,
