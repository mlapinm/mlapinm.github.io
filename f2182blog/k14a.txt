welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab 4.646375you can download the lab

file from the link in the description 8.063229in

this lab we will look a bit more at CDP

cisco discovery protocol 14.235583this should be

a fairly short lab looking at one more

CDP command which we didn't cover in the

last lab 20.598249we will use CDP to identify

more detailed information about

neighboring devices beyond that

displayed in the show CDP neighbors

command 29.741582step one is to use CDP to

identify which interfaces are used to

connect the routers and switches 38.560644we've

done this in previous labs so this

should be no problem 42.684478let's go on switch

one first 45.119582enable show CDP neighbors 51.100394as

you can see switch 1 is connected to r1

via the gigabit ethernet zero one

interface 57.684914and it's also connected to our

ones gigabit ethernet zero one interface
61.944247
next let's go to r1 64.678059enable show CDP

neighbors 70.755205r1 is connected to switch 1

via the gigabit ethernet zero one

interface as we just saw 77.650601it's also

connected to r2 via the gigabit ethernet

0 0 interface 82.501143connected to our two's

Gigabit Ethernet 0 0 interface 86.281143next

let's go on to r2 91.343372enable show CDP

neighbors 97.008726as we just saw it's connected

to r1 via the gigabit ethernet 0 0

interface 103.660372and it's connected to switch

to via the gigabit ethernet 0 1

interface 108.54483connected to switch 2 is

Gigabit Ethernet 0 1 interface 111.692913next

let's go on switch to to confirm 115.349017enable

shows CDP neighbors 120.85335as you can see it is

indeed connected to r2 via the gigabit

ethernet 0 1 interface 126.926309that's all for

step 1
128.851184
step2 actually doesn't require any new

commands 136.282642I just want to point out

something I didn't identify in the

previous lab 139.994475let's look back at switch 1
142.690684
in the results of the show CDP neighbors

command there is a platform column 148.530975what

does that identify 150.313704it's the hardware

model of the neighboring device 153.312266in this

case r1 is a C 1900 series router 157.84012let's

go on r1 to identify switch 1 and R 2 161.850078so

R 2 is a C 2900 series router and switch

1 is a 2960 series switch 170.821766finally let's

go on r2 to identify the model of its

neighbor switch 2 176.007682as you can see it is a

3560 model switch 181.728766and if you remember

the icon used to represent it here in

packet tracer 186.01037means it is a multi-layer

switch 188.261536multi-layer switches will be a

topic for later labs
192.056973
finally step three requires a new

command which we didn't cover in

previous labs 200.92891actually there are two

options 203.79493we have to identify the iOS

version of the neighboring devices 207.882451note

that you can do this on the device

itself with the show version command
212.791222
however for practice let's use CDP to

find this information 216.867118let's go on switch

one 219.819263now one option is the command show

CDP neighbors detail 225.603326clearly this gives

more information than the standard show

CDP neighbors command 232.267367in this case

switch one has only one neighbor 236.278201but if

a device has many neighbors this command

gives information for every neighbor

which can be overwhelming 242.405326if you want to

view detailed information about just one

device use this command 248.334909show CDP entry

followed by the name of the neighboring

device in this case r1 255.409721this displays the

same information just for the specified

device 260.730721now you can find the iOS version

of r1 here 264.63595it's 15.144 268.465637now let's

go on r1 270.726053show CDP entry switch one

switch 276.067282run is running version 12.25 FX
281.411011
let's also check our ones other neighbor

R 2 285.396302 show CDP entry r2 288.540552r2 is running

15.144 292.942072same as r1 294.324613finally let's

go on r2 to find the version of switch

2 298.287175show CDP entry switch 2 302.833612switch 2 is

running version 12.21
308.484591
now as a bonus I'd like to also

demonstrate the show version command I

briefly mentioned before 317.53407this gives a

lot of information about the device 320.81534but

for now let's just confirm the iOS

versions we learned about via CDP 325.26659on

switch 1 first 327.321277show version as you can

see there's a lot of info here 334.167547I

recommend looking through it to

familiarize yourself with what's here
337.788777
but let's just check the iOS version as

I said 341.11611switch 1 is running 12 point to

25 FX 345.686777which is the same as we saw from

CDP on our one 348.673402next let's go to our one
351.712339
show version our one is running version

15 point 1 4 & 4
359.099568
same as we saw from CDP again 361.590172next are

2 364.925277show version 367.469527r2 is running version

15 point 1 for M for same as our 1
373.459777
finally switch 2 376.648235show version 379.929068it's

running version 12 point to one 383.768526that's

all for this lab
