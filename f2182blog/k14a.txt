welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab you can download the lab

file from the link in the description in

this lab we will look a bit more at CDP

cisco discovery protocol this should be

a fairly short lab looking at one more

CDP command which we didn't cover in the

last lab we will use CDP to identify

more detailed information about

neighboring devices beyond that

displayed in the show CDP neighbors

command step one is to use CDP to

identify which interfaces are used to

connect the routers and switches we've

done this in previous labs so this

should be no problem let's go on switch

one first enable show CDP neighbors as

you can see switch 1 is connected to r1

via the gigabit ethernet zero one

interface and it's also connected to our

ones gigabit ethernet zero one interface

next let's go to r1 enable show CDP

neighbors r1 is connected to switch 1

via the gigabit ethernet zero one

interface as we just saw it's also

connected to r2 via the gigabit ethernet

0 0 interface connected to our two's

Gigabit Ethernet 0 0 interface next

let's go on to our to enable show CDP

neighbors as we just saw it's connected

to r1 via the gigabit ethernet 0 0

interface and it's connected to switch

to via the gigabit ethernet 0 1

interface connected to switch 2 is

Gigabit Ethernet 0 1 interface next

let's go on switch to to confirm enable

shows CDP neighbors as you can see it is

indeed connected to r2 via the gigabit

ethernet 0 1 interface that's all for

step 1

step2 actually doesn't require any new

commands I just want to point out

something I didn't identify in the

previous lab let's look back at switch 1

in the results of the show CDP neighbors

command there is a platform column what

does that identify it's the hardware

model of the neighboring device in this

case r1 is a C 1900 series router let's

go on r1 to identify switch 1 and R 2 so

R 2 is a C 2900 series router and switch

1 is a 2960 series switch finally let's

go on r2 to identify the model of its

neighbor switch 2 as you can see it is a

3560 model switch and if you remember

the icon used to represent it here in

packet tracer means it is a multi-layer

switch multi-layer switches will be a

topic for later labs

finally step three requires a new

command which we didn't cover in

previous labs actually there are two

options we have to identify the iOS

version of the neighboring devices note

that you can do this on the device

itself with the show version command

however for practice let's use CDP to

find this information let's go on switch

one now one option is the command show

CDP neighbors detail clearly this gives

more information than the standard show

CDP neighbors command in this case

switch one has only one neighbor but if

a device has many neighbors this command

gives information for every neighbor

which can be overwhelming if you want to

view detailed information about just one

device use this command show CDP entry

followed by the name of the neighboring

device in this case r1 this displays the

same information just for the specified

device now you can find the iOS version

of r1 here it's 15.1 for M for now let's

go on r1 show CDP entry switch one

switch run is running version 12.25 FX

let's also check our ones other neighbor

R to show CDP entry r2 r2 is running

15.1 for M for same as r1 finally let's

go on r2 to find the version of switch

to show CDP entry switch to switch to is

running version 12 point to one

now as a bonus I'd like to also

demonstrate the show version command I

briefly mentioned before this gives a

lot of information about the device but

for now let's just confirm the iOS

versions we learned about via CDP on

switch 1 first show version as you can

see there's a lot of info here I

recommend looking through it to

familiarize yourself with what's here

but let's just check the iOS version as

I said switch 1 is running 12 point to

25 FX which is the same as we saw from

CDP on our one next let's go to our one

show version our one is running version

15 point 1 4 & 4

same as we saw from CDP again next are

to show version our 2 is running version

15 point 1 for M for same as our 1

finally switch to show version it's

running version 12 point to one that's

all for this lab
