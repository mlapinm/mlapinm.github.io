Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,289
In this video we’re going to begin a series
of videos about OSPF, Open Shortest Path First.

8
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:27,730
It’s the only dynamic routing protocol that
is explicitly listed in the exam topics for

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:33,230
the CCNA, so we’re going to go quite in
depth about how OSPF works compared to the

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,730
brief overview given for RIP and EIGRP.

11
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:43,120
OSPF is topic 3.4 of the CCNA exam, which
states you should be able to ‘Configure

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,710
and verify single area OSPFv2’, with the
four sub-topics being neighbor adjacencies,

13
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,670
point-to-point, broadcast, and router ID.

14
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,640
We’ll cover all of these topics and more.

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,570
This first video, however, will focus on some
basics of OSPF.

16
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,280
Consider this a high-level introduction to
some OSPF concepts and configuration, and

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,469
then in later lectures we will go lower down
into the details of how OSPF works.

18
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:14,960
So, let’s see what we’ll cover in this
video.

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,700
First I’ll introduce some of the basic operations
of OSPF.

20
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,009
This will be just a quick introduction, in
the next video we’ll really go in depth.

21
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:28,640
Then I’ll talk about OSPF areas, which is
a unique feature of OSPF that splits larger

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,009
networks into smaller sections.

23
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:38,810
Finally I’ll show you some basic OSPF configurations,
like I showed you before for RIP and EIGRP.

24
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,760
Watch until the end of the video’s quiz
for a bonus question from Boson ExSim for

25
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,719
CCNA.

26
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,929
ExSim is a set of practice exams for the CCNA.

27
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:53,921
I used them myself when studying for my CCNA,
and also I used ExSim for CCNP too, and I

28
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:57,030
really think ExSim is an essential study tool.

29
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,100
If you want to get ExSim, follow the link
in the video description.

30
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,829
Okay, let’s get started with OSPF.

31
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,950
First up, here’s the same chart of the different
kinds of routing protocols I showed you before.

32
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,320
Remember that OSPF is a Link State dynamic
routing protocol.

33
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,650
You’ll see in this video that it functions
quite differently than the distance vector

34
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,280
routing protocols RIP and EIGRP.

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,590
To review, distance vector protocols use ‘routing
by rumor’ in which each router shares information

36
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,940
about the routes they know and their metric
cost to reach each destination.

37
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:36,190
However, the routers don’t have a complete
map of the network, they just use the information

38
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:41,250
their neighboring routers tell them to determine
the best route to each destination.

39
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,470
Now let’s review how link state protocols
function.

40
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:49,080
Here’s another slide I showed you in Day
24’s video.

41
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,380
When using a link state routing protocol,
every router creates a ‘connectivity map’

42
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,940
of the network.

43
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:00,570
To allow this, each router advertises information
about its interfaces (its connected networks)

44
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,430
to its neighbors.

45
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,540
These advertisements are passed along to other
routers, until all routers in the network

46
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,320
develop the same map of the network.

47
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,830
This is important, all routers have the same
complete map of the network.

48
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:20,170
Then, each router independently uses this
map to calculate the best routes to each destination.

49
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,290
Due to this process, Link state protocols
use more resources on the router, because

50
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,060
more information is shared.

51
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,500
It’s more demanding on the router.

52
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,940
However, link state protocols tend to be faster
in reacting to changes in the network than

53
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,150
distance vector protocols.

54
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,320
So that’s a quick review of link state routing
protocols.

55
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,520
Now we’ll start to go in depth about how
OSPF functions and you’ll get a deeper understanding

56
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,690
of what all this means, and see how different
it is to RIP and EIGRP, but also you’ll

57
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,690
see the similarities.

58
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,370
So, let’s get started with OSPF.

59
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,680
OSPF stands for ‘Open Shortest Path First’.

60
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,710
The OSPF protocol uses the ‘shortest path
first’ algorithm, created by Dutch computer

61
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,490
scientist Edsger Dijkstra.

62
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,330
Another name for the algorithm is ‘Dijsktra’s
algorithm’, remember that name!

63
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,020
It could be an exam question.

64
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,680
There are three versions of OSPF.

65
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,710
Version 1 was released in 1989.

66
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:19,430
It’s old and not in use anymore.

67
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:24,860
Version 2 was released in 1998, and this is
typically the version that is used in IP version

68
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,210
4 networks.

69
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,370
Take a look at the exam topics again.

70
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,550
The version of OSPF in the exam topics list
is version 2, so when I talk about OSPF in

71
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,300
these videos I will be talking about version
2.

72
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,080
There is also OSPF version 3, which was developed
for IPv6.

73
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,789
It can also be used for IPv4, but version
2 is more common in IPv4 networks.

74
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:51,800
Okay, now a couple general points about OSPF.

75
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,471
Routers store information about the network
in LSAs (Link State Advertisements), which

76
00:04:56,471 --> 00:05:01,009
are organized in a structure called the LSDB
(Link State Database).

77
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,540
LSA and LSDB are two important terms for OSPF.

78
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,330
I’ll talk more about them throughout these
videos on OSPF.

79
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,389
Routers will flood LSAs until all routers
in the OSPF area develop the same map of the

80
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:17,460
network, meaning the same LSDB.

81
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,150
So, those are two more important terms, ‘flood’
and ‘area’.

82
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,470
You already know the term flood, switches
do it when they receive a broadcast or unknown

83
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,210
unicast frame.

84
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:33,779
In the case of OSPF, it means they send the
LSAs to all of their OSPF neighbors.

85
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:38,129
OSPF ‘areas’ are a unique aspect of OSPF,
and I’ll talk more about them later in this

86
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,999
video.

87
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:45,581
Let me briefly elaborate on the last two points
in the previous slide, about LSAs and the

88
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:46,581
LSDB.

89
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:51,569
So, let’s say this network of four routers
is running OSPF.

90
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:56,039
All of these routers are OSPF neighbors, they
have the same link state database and the

91
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,249
network is stable.

92
00:05:57,249 --> 00:06:01,680
Then, OSPF is enabled on R4’s G1/0 interface.

93
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,400
So, R4 needs to tell the other routers about
this new network segment.

94
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,229
So, R4 creates an LSA to tell its neighbors
about the network on G1/0.

95
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:18,039
An OSPF LSA contains more information than
this, and we’ll look deeper later, but some

96
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:23,199
of the basic information in an LSA is the
RID, the router ID.

97
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,689
For this demonstration, R4’s router ID is
4.4.4.4.

98
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:34,720
None of its physical interfaces have an IP
address of 4.4.4.4, so either R4 has a loopback

99
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,919
interface with the IP address 4.4.4.4 or the
router ID was manually configured.

100
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,270
The network on the G1/0 interface is, of course,
included in the LSA, since that’s the main

101
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,169
purpose of the LSA.

102
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:52,050
R4’s cost is also included.

103
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,689
I’ll talk more about OSPF’s metric, called
cost, in the next lecture, but this GigabitEthernet

104
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:01,199
interface has a cost of 1.

105
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,060
The LSA is then flooded throughout the network
until all routers receive a copy.

106
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,379
That looks like this.

107
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:11,930
This results in all routers in the OSPF area
having the same LSDB.

108
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:19,559
The LSDB is like this, containing LSAs for
all of the different links in the network.

109
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:25,099
Now that OSPF has been activated on R4’s
G1/0 interface, that new LSA is added to the

110
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:26,099
LSDB.

111
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:31,279
I’m going to repeat this many times I’m
sure, but remember that this LSDB is identical

112
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,960
for all routers in the OSPF area.

113
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:41,080
Each router then uses the SPF algorithm, Dijkstra’s
algorithm, to calculate its best route to

114
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,339
192.168.4.0/24.

115
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:47,620
Remember, each of these routers has a complete
map of the network.

116
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:53,440
So, for example, you and I looking at this
diagram can see that R2’s best route to

117
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,260
192.168.4.0/24 is this route via G1/0.

118
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:03,379
Well, R2 is basically looking at the same
diagram, so it can calculate that sending

119
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:06,039
traffic via G1/0 is the best route.

120
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:11,029
It’s not looking at a visual diagram like
we are, of course, but in effect its the same

121
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:12,050
thing.

122
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:17,949
Finally, note that each individual LSA has
an aging timer, which is 30 minutes by default.

123
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:25,169
The LSA will be flooded again after the timer
expires, so once every 30 minutes by default.

124
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:26,509
Let me summarize the process.

125
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:31,710
In OSPF, there are three main steps in the
process of sharing LSAs and determining the

126
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,500
best route to each destination in the network.

127
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,000
Step 1 is to become neighbors with other routers
connected to the same segment.

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,250
In the network in the previous slide, for
example, R4 was OSPF neighbors with R2 and

129
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,350
R3.

130
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:52,209
Step 2 is to exchange LSAs with neighbor routers,
which you saw in the last slide.

131
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:57,380
Then, each router independently calculates
its best routes to each destination, and inserts

132
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,860
them into the routing table.

133
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,839
I will cover these steps in depth in the next
lecture.

134
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,270
Just keep in mind this basic process of OSPF.

135
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:13,680
Let’s move on to another fundamental concept
of OSPF, which isn’t part of RIP or EIGRP.

136
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,240
OSPF areas.

137
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,160
OSPF uses areas to divide up the network.

138
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,990
However, small networks can be single-area
without any negative effects on network performance.

139
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:30,430
For example, this network with four routers
is a small network.

140
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:35,040
When configuring OSPF in a network like this
we can use just a single OSPF ‘area’ and

141
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,920
there won’t be any degradation of network
performance.

142
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,230
In larger networks, however, a single-area
design can have some negative effects.

143
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:50,310
For example, if the OSPF network had 500 routers
with over 1000 subnets instead of 4 routers

144
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:56,190
and just a few subnets, using just a single
OSPF area would be a bad idea.

145
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,230
You should divide a large network like that
into several smaller areas.

146
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,300
Now, what are some of the negative effects
of using a single-area design in a large network?

147
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:12,259
Well, for example the SPF algorithm takes
more time to calculate routes in a large network.

148
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:18,110
It also requires exponentially more processing
power on each router to make calculations.

149
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:23,360
Each router sharing a single, huge link state
database also takes up more memory on the

150
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,589
routers.

151
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:29,560
On top of that, every small change on the
network, for example a new interface being

152
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,580
activated, would caused LSAs to be flooded
to all 500 routers, and all of those routers

153
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,149
would have to do the SPF calculation again.

154
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:43,420
By dividing a large OSPF network into several
smaller areas, you can avoid the above negative

155
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,149
effects.

156
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:50,290
Checking the exam topics once more, notice
that only single area OSPF is mentioned.

157
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:55,320
So, I will only give a brief overview of OSPF
areas and how they work, you don’t need

158
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,589
too much detail for the CCNA.

159
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:02,220
I’m not going to make a diagram with 500
routers, but here’s an example of a larger

160
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,980
network than the previous one.

161
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,819
It’s possible to make this one large, single-area
network.

162
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:12,990
All interfaces on all routers are assigned
to area 0, also known as the backbone area.

163
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:18,350
You’ll see soon that area 0 is of special
importance in OSPF, and it’s called the

164
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,350
‘backbone’ area.

165
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:25,230
Now, instead of one large area I’ll show
you how the network can be divided into separate

166
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,230
areas.

167
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,269
Here’s how it’s done.

168
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:33,000
Now, there are some rules and terminology
you should know about OSPF areas, I’ll explain

169
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,940
them now.

170
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:36,589
First up, what is an area?

171
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:43,399
It’s a set of routers and links that share
the same LSDB, link state database.

172
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,529
Looking at this diagram once more, how many
areas are there?

173
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:50,779
Area 0,  Area 1, Area 2, and Area 3.

174
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:53,180
So, there are four areas.

175
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,360
Each of these areas maintains a unique LSDB.

176
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,829
Next, the backbone area (which is area 0)
is an area, a special area, that all other

177
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:04,600
areas must connect to.

178
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,949
Let’s check that network diagram again.

179
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:14,980
Notice that area 1, area 2, and area 3 all
connect to area 0, the backbone area.

180
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,009
This kind of network design, for example,
is not allowed in OSPF.

181
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:23,110
Notice that area 1 is not connected to area
0, the backbone area.

182
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,230
It is only connected to area 2.

183
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,440
This is not allowed in OSPF.

184
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,279
Next up, routers with all interfaces in the
same area are called ‘internal routers’.

185
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,779
So, in this diagram which routers are internal
routers?

186
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:42,510
If all of the router’s interfaces are in
the same area, it’s an internal router.

187
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,920
This router here is internal to area 0.

188
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,889
These routers are internal routers in area
1.

189
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:52,759
Same for these routers in area 2, and these
routers in area 3.

190
00:12:52,759 --> 00:13:00,040
So, those are internal routers, routers with
all of their interfaces in the same OSPF area.

191
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,320
Next up, routers with interfaces in multiple
areas are called ‘area border routers’,

192
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,399
because they are the border between different
OSPF areas.

193
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,000
In this network, which routers are ABRs?

194
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,670
This router, connected to area 0 and area
1, is an ABR.

195
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:22,139
This router, connected to area 0 and area
2, is also an ABR.

196
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,910
And this router, connected to area 0 and area
3, is an ABR.

197
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:33,140
So remember that ABRs, Area Border Routers,
are routers with interfaces in multiple OSPF

198
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,180
areas.

199
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,560
One more bit of information about ABRs.

200
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,780
ABRs maintain a separate LSDB for each area
they are connected to.

201
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:46,360
It is recommend that you connect an ABR to
a maximum of 2 areas.

202
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,920
Connecting an ABR to 3+ areas can overburden
the router.

203
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,800
So, a design like I show here is good OSPF
network design, with each ABR only connected

204
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,040
to 2 areas.

205
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,449
Next, routers connected to the backbone area,
which as I said before is area 0, are called

206
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:05,279
backbone routers.

207
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,939
This includes area border routers, by the
way.

208
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:12,069
So, which routers in this network are backbone
routers?

209
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:17,649
Of course, this router is connected only to
area 0, so it is a backbone router.

210
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:22,940
It is a backbone router and an internal router,
internal to area 0.

211
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,399
This router is also a backbone router, on
top of being an ABR.

212
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,050
Same for this router, and this router.

213
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:35,500
They are both backbone routers and area border
routers, ABRs.

214
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,149
Next term, an ‘intra-area route’ is a
route to a destination inside the same OSPF

215
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:41,740
area.

216
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,779
For example, from a router in area 1 to a
destination that is also in area 1.

217
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:49,540
Let’s see an example.

218
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:54,519
For example, if this router learns a route
to this subnet, it is considered an intra-area

219
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,279
route, because the destination is in the same
area as the router.

220
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:00,600
Here’s the final term.

221
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,100
An ‘interarea route’ is a route to a destination
in a different OSPF area.

222
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,550
For example, if a router in area 1 learns
a route to a destination in area 2, that is

223
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,330
an interarea route.

224
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,660
Let’s see one more example.

225
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:21,149
If this router in area 1 learns a route to
this subnet in area 2, it is considered an

226
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:22,839
interarea route.

227
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,959
The router and the destination are in two
different OSPF areas.

228
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:32,480
So, those are some important OSPF terms regarding
OSPF areas.

229
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,769
Make sure you learn and understand these,
and use the flashcards to remember them.

230
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:43,399
Area, backbone area, internal router, area
border router, backbone router, intra-area

231
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,290
route, and interarea route, remember those
terms.

232
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:52,420
Next up, let’s cover a few additional rules
about OSPF areas.

233
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,850
First up, OSPF areas should be ‘contiguous’.

234
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,180
What does that mean?

235
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,940
It means that each individual area should
be connected, not divided up.

236
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,750
It’s easier to demonstrate with the network
diagram.

237
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,370
So, this network satisfies that rule.

238
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,569
All areas are contiguous.

239
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:15,220
Now let’s look at what it means to be non-contiguous.

240
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,790
Area 1 is now non-contiguous.

241
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:23,529
Instead of all being connected, half of area
1 is here, and half of area 1 is here.

242
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:27,600
This kind of network design is not allowed
in OSPF and will cause problems.

243
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,470
So, instead of having area 1 split up and
non-contiguous like this,

244
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:36,470
you should make this section on the right
a separate area, area 3.

245
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,940
Now all of the areas are contiguous and OSPF
can function properly.

246
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:47,830
Next rule, all OSPF areas must have at least
one ABR connected to the backbone area.

247
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,329
I actually already mentioned this, but it’s
worth repeating.

248
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:54,079
Let’s look at the network diagram again.

249
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:01,259
So, notice that area 1 has an ABR connected
to both area 1 and area 0, area 2 has an ABR

250
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:07,459
connected to both area 2 and area 0, and area
3 also has an ABR connected to both area 3

251
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,909
and area 0.

252
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:12,209
This is correct OSPF network design.

253
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:17,230
As I showed you before, a network like this
is not correct OSPF design and will cause

254
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:24,059
problems, because area 1 does not have an
ABR connected to the backbone area, area 0.

255
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:29,320
One more rule, OSPF interfaces in the same
subnet must be in the same area.

256
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,130
If they’re not in the same area, they won’t
become OSPF neighbors and won’t exchange

257
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,210
information about the networks they know about.

258
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,070
In a future video I will go more in detail
about some other requirements for routers

259
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,850
to become OSPF neighbors, but for now let’s
leave it at this one.

260
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,190
So, let me demonstrate.

261
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:53,580
In this example, these three routers all have
an interface in area 0, in the 192.168.1.0/29

262
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,539
subnet.

263
00:17:55,539 --> 00:18:02,380
This router also has an interface in the 192.168.1.0/29
subnet, but the interface is in area 1, not

264
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,510
area 0.

265
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:08,940
Even though all four interfaces are in the
same subnet and OSPF is enabled on them, the

266
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,570
area 1 router will not become OSPF neighbors
with the others.

267
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:20,280
This time, the area 1 ABR’s interface in
the 192.168.1.0/29 subnet is correctly configured

268
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,640
in area 0.

269
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,190
So, all four routers will become OSPF neighbors.

270
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,600
Here’s a summary of those three rules.

271
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,660
Of course, I will cover many more points about
OSPF in the next few videos.

272
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:37,960
I will go in depth about OSPF neighbors, OSPF
LSAs, and other points.

273
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:44,679
But now let’s cover some basic OSPF configurations
so we can practice them in the lab video.

274
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:48,930
So let’s use the same network topology that
we did for RIP and EIGRP, since you’re already

275
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,940
familiar with it.

276
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,950
Although it’s important that you understand
those rules and terms about OSPF areas, for

277
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:01,150
the CCNA you only have to configure single-area
OSPF, so all of these router interfaces are

278
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,320
in OSPF area 0.

279
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:10,770
I’ve already configured R2, R3, and R4,
so let’s configure OSPF on R1.

280
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:15,450
Here is the basic OSPF configuration, let’s
walk through it.

281
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:20,890
First up, to enter OSPF configuration mode
you use the command ROUTER OSPF, followed

282
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,150
by a process ID.

283
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:28,100
A router can run multiple OSPF processes at
once, and this ID is used in the router to

284
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,730
identify each of them.

285
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,940
Typically you’ll just use a single OSPF
process, so don’t worry about this number,

286
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,059
I chose to use 1.

287
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:43,360
If you remember the EIGRP configuration, you
used the command ROUTER EIGRP, followed by

288
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,360
an AS number.

289
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,480
For EIGRP routers to become neighbors, their
AS number has to match.

290
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,250
However, the OSPF process ID is different.

291
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,880
The OSPF process ID is locally significant.

292
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,420
Routers with different process IDs can become
OSPF neighbors.

293
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:08,020
Usually I just use process ID 1, but you
could for example use process ID 1 on R1 and

294
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:15,030
process ID 2 on R2, and they would still become
OSPF neighbors and exchange LSAs.

295
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,649
Note that this process ID is totally unrelated
to the area.

296
00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:22,010
You’ll see next that the area is configured
separately.

297
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:27,549
So, next I attempted to use the network command
just like I did in EIGRP.

298
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:31,890
Note that OSPF uses wildcard masks just like
in EIGRP.

299
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,570
If you need to review them, go back and watch
Day 25’s video.

300
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,390
Basically, it’s an inverse subnet mask.

301
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:43,790
Anyway, I tried to use that command but then
the router says ‘Incomplete command’.

302
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:49,300
That’s because the OSPF network command
requires you to specify the area.

303
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:54,640
So I activated OSPF on all of these interfaces,
in area 0.

304
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,750
Once again, for the CCNA you only need to
configure single-area OSPF, and usually you’ll

305
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,080
use area 0.

306
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,760
For single area OSPF it’s actually possible
to use any area number, but it’s considered

307
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,210
best practice to use area 0.

308
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,160
Before moving on, let me review the function
of the NETWORK command, it’s just like in

309
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,080
RIP and EIGRP.

310
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,409
The network commands tells OSPF to look for
any interfaces with an IP address contained

311
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:26,550
in the range specified in the network command,
and then activate OSPF on the interface in

312
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,080
the specified area.

313
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:35,090
For example, in the first network command
I specified 10.0.12.0 with a /28 wildcard

314
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,500
mask, in area 0.

315
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:45,630
R1’s G0/0 interface has an IP address of
10.0.12.1, which is contained in 10.0.12.0/28.

316
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:51,950
So, OSPF will be activated on G0/0 in area
0.

317
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:56,659
When OSPF is activated on the interface, the
router will then try to become OSPF neighbors

318
00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:00,250
with other OSPF-activated neighbor routers.

319
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,880
In this case, R1 will become OSPF neighbors
with R2 and R3.

320
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,370
I’ll explain that process in depth in the
next video.

321
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:13,330
So, just remember that the NETWORK command
is simply used to tell the router which interfaces

322
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,520
to activate OSPF on.

323
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,930
It doesn’t tell the router ‘advertise
these networks’.

324
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:23,149
But we already covered that in the last video,
now let’s look at a few other configurations

325
00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:26,440
you can do in OSPF.

326
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,559
First up, the PASSIVE-INTERFACE command.

327
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:35,230
You already know this command from RIP and
EIGRP, it’s totally the same for OSPF.

328
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:39,750
The passive-interface command tells the router
to stop sending OSPF ‘hello’ messages

329
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,180
out of the interface.

330
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:47,160
OSPF uses hello messages to tell other routers
about itself, wait for Day 27’s video for

331
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,909
more details on that.

332
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:53,220
However, the router will continue to send
LSAs informing it’s neighbors about the

333
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,520
subnet configured on the interface.

334
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,790
So, although R1 won’t send hellos out of
G2/0 and try to find OSPF neighbors, it will

335
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:08,460
still tell its other neighbors about the 172.16.1.0/28
network.

336
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,240
You should always use this command on interfaces
which don’t have any OSPF neighbors.

337
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,100
It’s a waste to continuously send hello
messages out of an interface with no other

338
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,450
routers connected to it.

339
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:26,850
So, that’s the PASSIVE-INTERFACE command,
it’s basically the same as for RIP and EIGRP

340
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:31,290
Next up let’s see how to advertise a default
route into OSPF, just like I showed you before

341
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,290
for RIP.

342
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:36,450
So, I’ve added an Internet connection to
R1.

343
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:41,260
Then I configured a default route on R1, and
the next hop is the ISP’s IP address of

344
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,330
203.0.113.2.

345
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,000
Here is that information in the routing table of
R1.

346
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,240
Feel free to pause here if you want to check
out the other OSPF routes that R1 has learned, too.

347
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,799
Just like I showed you in RIP, the command
to advertise the default route into OSPF is

348
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,760
DEFAULT-INFORMATION ORIGINATE.

349
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,850
In OSPF this will cause the router to create
a new LSA and flood it.

350
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:11,600
I checked R2’s routing table, and you can
see it added the default route via R1 to its

351
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,779
route table.

352
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:15,970
R3 and R4 would also do the same.

353
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:22,669
Now let’s take a look at the SHOW IP PROTOCOLS
command from an OSPF perspective, and we’ll

354
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,470
check out some other commands as well.

355
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,549
Up top it says ‘routing protocol is ospf
1’.

356
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:32,690
1 is the process ID I configured earlier.

357
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,650
OSPF also uses a router ID, and the router
ID is determined in exactly the same way as

358
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:41,269
in EIGRP, let’s review it.

359
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:46,350
Here is the order of priority when determining
the OSPF router ID.

360
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:51,990
First up, if you manually configure the router
ID, that will become the router ID.

361
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:57,140
If you don’t manually configure the router
ID, the highest IP address on a loopback interface

362
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,640
will become the router ID.

363
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,350
If the router has no loopback interfaces with
an IP address, the highest IP address on a

364
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,289
physical interface will become the router
ID.

365
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:13,870
Currently R1’s router ID is 172.16.1.14,
because I haven’t manually configured the

366
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:18,260
router ID, and I also haven’t configured
a loopback interface on R1.

367
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,240
Let’s see how to manually configure the
router ID.

368
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,940
From OSPF configuration mode, use the ROUTER-ID
command.

369
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:33,530
This is a little different from EIGRP, in
EIGRP the command is EIGRP ROUTER-ID, but

370
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:36,460
in OSPF it’s just ROUTER-ID.

371
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:43,580
So, I entered a router ID of 1.1.1.1, but
then the router displayed this message.

372
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:49,080
Reload or use ‘clear ip ospf process’
command, for this to take effect’.

373
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:57,950
So currently, the router ID is still 172.16.1.14,
to make 1.1.1.1 take effect we have to either

374
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:02,960
reload the router or use that command to clear
the OSPF process and reset it.

375
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:10,309
I did that, from privileged exec mode I used
the command CLEAR IP OSPF PROCESS.

376
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:14,390
This basically resets OSPF on the router.

377
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:18,929
This is a bad idea in a real network, and
the router will lose all of its OSPF routes

378
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:23,789
for a short time and won’t be able to forward
traffic to those destinations.

379
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:27,019
In a lab like this, however, it’s not a
problem.

380
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:31,030
As a side note, notice the ‘no’ in square
brackets.

381
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:35,970
When you see this after entering a command,
it means ‘no’ is the default choice.

382
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:41,700
If you just press enter, the router will assume
‘no’ and not clear the OSPF process.

383
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,850
However I typed ‘yes’, so it was cleared.

384
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:53,040
Then I did SHOW IP PROTOCOLS again and you
can see that the router ID is now 1.1.1.1.

385
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,610
Now let’s look at the rest of the command.

386
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:59,780
Take a look here, ‘It is an autonomous system
boundary router’.

387
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:06,730
An autonomous system boundary router, or ASBR,
is an OSPF router that connects the OSPF network

388
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,540
to an external network.

389
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,350
R1 is connected to the Internet.

390
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:16,899
By using the DEFAULT-INFORMATION ORIGINATE
command, R1 becomes an ASBR, it connects the

391
00:27:16,899 --> 00:27:19,110
OSPF network to the Internet.

392
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:23,909
So, that’s why we see this output here on
R1.

393
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,820
Next up, number of areas in this router is
1.

394
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:31,690
1 normal 0 stub 0 nssa.

395
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,210
These are three different types of OSPF areas,
it’s not necessary to know about the different

396
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:40,740
types for the CCNA, just wanted to point out
that you can see the number of areas this

397
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,240
router is in, just one because this is single-area
OSPF.

398
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,070
Next, maximum paths is 4.

399
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:56,769
Unlike EIGRP, OSPF doesn’t support unequal-cost
load-balancing, but it does support ECMP load-balancing

400
00:27:56,769 --> 00:28:00,200
over a maximum of 4 paths by default.

401
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,409
To change the maximum number of paths, use
the MAXIMUM-PATHS command just like in RIP

402
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:07,799
and EIGRP.

403
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,400
Here I changed the number to 8.

404
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,669
The ‘routing for networks’ section shows
the network commands we used.

405
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:20,860
To repeat myself, this only determines which
interfaces OSPF will be activated on, it doesn’t

406
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,690
tell OSPF to flood LSAs for these specific
networks.

407
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:30,730
Here’s the passive interface we configured,
and here are R1’s neighbors.

408
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:37,029
Notice the router IDs, I configured these
loopback interfaces on R2, R3, and R4 and

409
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:39,620
their IP addresses became the router IDs.

410
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:46,660
Finally, down here OSPF’s AD is displayed,
the default is 110 as you know.

411
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,670
If you want to change it, the command is the
same as for RIP and EIGRP.

412
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:56,400
From OSPF configuration mode, just use the
command DISTANCE.

413
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:02,639
For example, I changed it to 85, so OSPF routes
are preferred over EIGRP routes on this router.

414
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:04,570
That’s all for the lecture.

415
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:08,539
We covered a lot of information, but lots
of it is similar to or the same as what we

416
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,260
learned about RIP and EIGRP.

417
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,500
Of course, there was plenty of new information
too.

418
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,110
Before moving on to the quiz, let’s review
what we covered.

419
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:23,700
I gave a basic overview of OSPF operations,
including a very brief look at LSAs, which

420
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,789
we will cover in more depth later.

421
00:29:25,789 --> 00:29:29,090
I introduced OSPF areas.

422
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:34,630
Although the CCNA only requires you to configure
single-area OSPF, you still need a basic understanding

423
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:37,140
of OSPF areas.

424
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:42,769
Make sure to remember those basic OSPF rules
and terms like area border router, ABR, and

425
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:46,659
autonomous system boundary router, ASBR.

426
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:50,010
Finally we looked at some basic OSPF configurations.

427
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:55,390
Most of these were the same as in RIP and
EIGRP, with a few minor differences.

428
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:59,300
Make sure to watch until the end of the quiz
for a bonus question from Boson ExSim for

429
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:05,830
CCNA, the best practice exams for the CCNA
and the ones I used myself to prepare.

430
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:09,870
If you want to get Boson ExSim, follow the
link in the video description.

431
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,090
Here’s quiz question 1.

432
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:16,500
Which of the following statements about OSPF
are not true?

433
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,620
Select two.

434
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:25,640
A, In multi-area OSPF networks, all non-backbone
areas must have an ABR connected to area 0.

435
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,059
B, Single-area OSPF must use area 0.

436
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:36,029
C, Two OSPF routers with different process
IDs can become OSPF neighbors.

437
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:41,039
D, The OSPF area must be specified in the
network command.

438
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:48,650
E, An ASBR connects the internal OSPF network
to networks outside of the OSPF domain.

439
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:53,760
And F, The OSPF process ID must match the
area number.

440
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,929
Pause the video to think about the answers,
select two.

441
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:05,570
The answers are B and F. Although it is common
practice to use area 0 for single-area OSPF,

442
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,990
you can actually use any area.

443
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:11,460
And the OSPF process ID does not have to match
the area number.

444
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:17,620
In fact, in multi-area OSPF there will be
multiple areas operating in a single process,

445
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,870
so it’s impossible to match the process
ID to all area IDs.

446
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,549
The other statements are all true.

447
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:27,139
Let’s go to question 2.

448
00:31:27,139 --> 00:31:33,230
You want to activate OSPF on R1’s G0/1 and
G0/2 interfaces with a single command.

449
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:43,279
G0/1’s IP address is 10.0.12.1/28, and G0/2’s
IP address is 10.0.13.1/26.

450
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,799
Which of the following commands should you
use on R1?

451
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:54,280
Here are the commands, A, B, C, and D. Pause
the video now to look at the commands and

452
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:59,400
find the correct answer.

453
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:07,419
The answer is C, NETWORK 10.0.12.0 0.0.1.255
area 0.

454
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:11,530
This is the only option that contains both
IP addresses in its range, so it’s the only

455
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:14,390
one that activates OSPF on both interfaces.

456
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:18,000
Let’s go to question 3.

457
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,159
Answer the following questions about the OSPF
network below.

458
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:24,309
1, How many backbone routers are there?

459
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:27,390
2, How many ABRs are there?

460
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:30,649
And 3, How many ASBRs are there?

461
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:37,620
Pause the video now to answer each of these
questions.

462
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,340
Okay let’s check each of them.

463
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,650
How many backbone routers are there?

464
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,279
There are 4.

465
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:48,009
These 4 routers are backbone routers because
they all have at least one interface in the

466
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:49,970
backbone area, area 0.

467
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:53,210
Now, how many ABRs are there?

468
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,580
There are 3.

469
00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:00,750
These 3 routers have interfaces in 2 separate
areas, so they are ABRs, area border routers.

470
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:04,000
Finally, how many ASBRs are there?

471
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,730
Just one, This router here connects the OSPF
network to the Internet, and likely advertises

472
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,159
a default route into the OSPF domain.

473
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,320
Let’s go to question 4.

474
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,669
Which of the following commands will make
R1 an OSPF ASBR?

475
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:21,750
Here are the options.

476
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:32,980
A, B, C, and D. Pause the video to look at
the options and select the best answer.

477
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:38,139
The correct answer is B, which first configures
a default route and then advertises it into

478
00:33:38,139 --> 00:33:42,639
OSPF using the DEFAULT-INFORMATION ORIGINATE
command.

479
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:49,269
Option A simply configures two network commands
which activates OSPF on the specified interfaces.

480
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:54,520
Option C activates OSPF on ALL interfaces
with an IP address, since all IP addresses

481
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,470
match 0.0.0.0/0.

482
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,210
Option D is not a real command.

483
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:04,200
Let’s go to question 5.

484
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,300
Which command can be used to manually configure
the OSPF router ID?

485
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,819
Here are the commands.

486
00:34:09,819 --> 00:34:21,770
A, B, C, and D. Pause the video to examine
the commands and select the correct answer.

487
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:29,579
The correct answer is A, ROUTER-ID 1.1.1.1,
entered in OSPF configuration mode.

488
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:36,210
The command to manually configure the EIGRP
router ID is EIGRP ROUTER-ID, but for OSPF

489
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,020
it’s just ROUTER-ID.

490
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,790
Option C configures an IP address on a loopback
interface.

491
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:47,679
If the router ID isn’t manually configured
this IP address might become the OSPF router

492
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,610
ID, but it’s different than manually configuring
the router ID.

493
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:58,100
That’s all for the quiz, now let’s do
a bonus question from Boson ExSim for CCNA.

494
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:03,410
Okay, here's today's Boson ExSim practice
question.

495
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:06,270
You administer the OSPF network above.

496
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,350
You issue the DEFAULT-INFORMATION ORIGINATE
command on RouterA.

497
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,520
Which of the following statements are true?

498
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,490
Select 2 choices.

499
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:18,310
A, OSPF will advertise RouterA's gateway of
last resort.

500
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:22,160
B, RouterA will become the OSPF ABR.

501
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,640
C, OSPF will summarize all of RouterA's directly
connected routes.

502
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,950
D, RouterA will become the OSPF ASBR.

503
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:35,170
And E, OSPF will redistribute all of RouterA's
directly connected routes.

504
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:44,300
Okay, so pause the video here to think about
your answer.

505
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,150
Okay, so let's check the answer.

506
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,270
So there are two choices.

507
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:52,410
We used the DEFAULT-INFORMATION ORIGINATE
command, which we just covered in this video

508
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:55,359
as well as the previous video on RIP and EIGRP.

509
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:01,740
So, what this command does is it advertises
the router's default route into that routing

510
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,589
protocol, OSPF in this case.

511
00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:07,730
So that means A is one of the correct options.

512
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:12,410
OSPF will advertise RouterA's gateway of last
resort, that is the default route.

513
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:18,490
Okay, next, it's either B or D, is the second
correct choice.

514
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:25,420
Will RouterA become the OSPF ABR, or will
RouterA become the OSPF ASBR?

515
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,020
So, an ABR is an Area Border Router.

516
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:34,260
It is an OSPF router that has interfaces in
2 separate OSPF areas, usually area 0, the

517
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,869
backbone area, and one other area.

518
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:42,990
Now, an ASBR, Autonomous System Boundary Router,
is an OSPF router that is connected to an

519
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:46,490
external network, outside of the OSPF domain.

520
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:52,520
And it shares information into the OSPF domain
about those external networks.

521
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:58,920
So that makes D the correct answer, because
this default route is probably a route to

522
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,460
the Internet, for example, and RouterA advertises
that default route into the OSPF domain.

523
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,720
So let's check the answer.

524
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,740
Click on 'show answer' down here.

525
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,950
And we are correct.

526
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:14,450
So this is Boson's explanation of this question.

527
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:19,900
Not only why A and D are the correct options,
but also why B, C, and E are incorrect.

528
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:24,780
So, pause the video here if you want to read
Boson's explanation.

529
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:29,990
In addition to Boson's explanation, there
is a reference here to Cisco documentation.

530
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:33,060
OSPF Command Reference: default-information
originate.

531
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,630
So, Cisco's documentation is a really great
study resource.

532
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:41,130
If you ever have any doubts about some certain
topic, I recommend doing a Google search,

533
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:43,540
and Cisco's documentation often comes up.

534
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,570
So, you can use that as an additional study
resource.

535
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:51,290
