In this lab we’ll configure interfaces on a router and two switches.
27.020
This is a single LAN, 172.16.0.0/16, connected to R1’s G0/0 interface.
36.370
In the real world, R1 would then connect to other LANs or perhaps the Internet, but we’ll
41.660
just configure this small LAN for now. Let’s get started.
45.930
So, there are six main steps in this lab. 1, configure hostnames.
51.720
2, configure IP addresses.
54.960
3, configure speed and duplex.
57.860
4, configure interface descriptions.
61.130
5, disable unused interfaces.
64.330
And 6, save the configurations.
67.310
Instead of going through each step one by one, I’ll go through the steps one device
71.609
at a time, but you can do it in any order you like.
75.210
So, let’s go on R1 first. The first step is to configure the hostname.
82.899
As you can see, it currently has the default hostname of ‘router’ as indicated by the prompt here.
88.369
Let’s change it to R1.
91.240
Use ‘enable’ to enter privileged exec mode, then ‘configure terminal’ to enter global config mode.
98.700
From here simply type hostname R1, and you can see the prompt has changed to indicate the new hostname.
106.990
Now let’s configure the IP address on its G0/0 interface.
111.560
Type ‘interface g0/0’ to enter interface config mode for the interface.
117.409
Actually, before doing the configuration, let’s confirm the current status of the interface.
123.799
Do show ip interface brief.
126.490
Remember, ‘do’ let’s me use the show command even though I’m not in privileged exec mode.
133.620
Here’s the gigabitethernet0/0 interface, the IP address is unassigned, so the method
139.349
is unset, and the status is administratively down because that’s the default setting for router interfaces.
147.239
Let’s configure it and then check again after.
150.510
So, let’s configure the IP address.
154.100
IP ADDRESS 172.16.255.254, and because the prefix length is /16, the subnet mask will be 255.255.0.0.
168.540
Okay, now because this interface is connected to another networking device, SW1, I’ll
173.640
manually configure the speed and duplex.
177.049
SPEED 1000, meaning 1000 megabits per second because this is a gigabitethernet interface. Then, duplex full.
187.020
Devices attached to switches can use full duplex, there’s no reason to use half-duplex
191.709
like a device attached to a hub.
194.800
Next let’s configure a description.
197.300
I’ll indicate that this device (interface) is connected to SW1.
201.530
So, description ## to SW1 ##. Now, the last step is to disable interfaces which are not connected to other devices.
211.970
Because router interfaces are shutdown by default, we don’t have to do that, however
217.049
we do have to do the opposite for this interface which is connected to another device, so no shutdown.
223.689
There we go, now the interface is enabled and let’s check out the status.
229.770
Do show ip interface brief.
232.620
Okay, you can see the IP address we configured, the method is manual, the status is up, but
239.930
the protocol is down.
242.459
Although on a real Cisco device I think this should be UP/UP, on packet tracer its down
248.650
because I manually configured the speed and duplex on this interface without doing so
253.409
on SW1’s interface, but we’ll fix that soon.
256.660
That’s a downside of using a simulator like packet tracer, sometimes things don’t behave
262.290
like they should on a real device.
265.470
Before moving on to SW1, I’ll configure descriptions on R1’s other interfaces to
270.530
indicate that they are not in use.
272.690
I’ll use the interface range command.
276.830
Interface range g0/1 – 2.
281.139
DESCRIPTION ## not in use ##. Okay, let’s check our config. Do show run.
287.850
Here’s the running config of the device, and here are the configurations of the interface,
293.810
including speed, duplex, ip addresses, and descriptions.
297.860
Okay, since I’m done configuring, I’ll use END to return to privileged exec mode.
304.390
Now let’s save the running configuration.
307.140
There are three Cisco devices in this lab, I’ll use a different method to save the
311.270
configuration on each device to show you each one.
315.000
Here on R1, I’ll use copy running-config startup-config, and hit enter to confirm.
322.670
Now let’s check if it was saved to the startup-config.
326.000
Show startup-config….here are the interfaces, and you can see the configuration changes we made.
333.650
Okay, that’s all for R1.
337.280
Before moving on to SW1, I’ll make the only configuration change we need to make on the
341.750
PCs, configuring their IP addresses.
344.860
Let’s go on PC1….Click on config.
350.560
And notice I pre-configured the gateway, which is R1’s address, because its the router for the network.
356.690
Now, click on Fastethernet0, which is PC1’s network interface.
361.910
PC1’s IP address is 172.16.0.1.
368.030
I hit TAB, and it automatically fills in the appropriate subnet mask 255.255.0.0.
375.520
Okay, now I can exit out.
379.120
Next is PC2. Click config. Fastethernet0.
384.820
IP address 172.16.0.2, hit tab and it fills in the subnet mask. Next is PC3...config. Fastethernet0.
397.760
IP address of 172.16.0.3, hit tab to fill in the subnet mask, and exit. Finally, PC4….config. Fastethernet0.
410.300
IP address of 172.16.0.4, hit tab to fill in the subnet mask, and exit.
418.710
Okay, now let’s configure SW1….enable. Conf t. First, the hostname. Hostname SW1.
431.690
Now let’s check out the interfaces.
434.290
Do show interfaces status.
437.400
This is a command that works on switches, but not routers, by the way.
442.000
As you can see, all default settings. No descriptions.
446.680
The statuses are connected or not connect, not DISABLED because these are switch interfaces,
452.680
they are not shutdown by default.
455.100
The speed and duplex are auto and auto as well.
458.920
Okay, let’s configure the G0/1 interface. Interface g0/1. Speed 1000. DUPLEX full.
468.770
It’s connected to R1, so DESCRIPTION ## to R1 ##. Thats it! Now G0/2. Interface G0/2. Speed 1000. DUPLEX full.
483.750
It’s connected to SW2, so DESCRIPTION ## to SW2 ##. Now, as for fastethernet0/1 and 0/2,
493.890
they are connected to end hosts so according to the lab instructions I don’t need to
498.110
configure the speed and duplex.
500.000
So, I’ll just configure descriptions.
504.190
Interface range f0/1 – 2.
508.150
DESCRIPTION ## to end hosts ##. Now, as for the rest of the interfaces, I’ll configure
514.300
descriptions and shut them down.
517.080
There are 22 unused fastethernet interfaces, so interface range f0/3 – 24.
526.580
DESCRIPTION ## not in use ##. shutdown.
531.360
Okay, let’s configure the configurations.
533.920
Do show interface status.
536.390
Okay, you can see the interfaces we disabled.
539.940
Again, because I configured the duplex manually on G0/2 it's down at the moment, but will come up when we configure SW2.
549.320
Notice the speed and duplex we manually configured.
552.650
This is also a problem with packet tracer.
554.820
It says a-1000 and a-full, meaning it autonegotiated the speed of 1000 and duplex of full, which
564.110
is incorrect because we manually configured it.
567.680
On a real Cisco device, this will say simply 1000 and full, without the A. Anyway, I’ll
575.580
type END to return to privileged exec mode.
579.010
Now let’s save the configuration.
581.420
This time, I’ll use WRITE MEMORY.
583.590
Okay, let’s check the startup-config. Show startup-config.
589.080
Okay, you can see the changes we made to the interfaces here.
593.520
Let’s go on to the last device, SW2….enable. Conf t. hostname SW2.
603.080
Let’s check the interfaces.
605.860
Do show interfaces status.
608.700
As you can see, all the defaults again.
611.990
Now the configurations we will make are the same as for SW1, except SW2 has only one active gigabitethernet interface, G0/1.
620.520
So, I’ll run through the configurations. Interface g0/1. Speed 1000. duplex full.
631.130
DESCRIPTION ## to SW1 ##. interface range f0/1 – 2.
637.830
description ## to end hosts ##. Now, let’s shut down the other interfaces all at once.
644.240
Interface range g0/2, f0/3 – 24.
650.140
description ## not in use ##. shutdown. Now let’s check.
655.300
Do show interfaces status.
658.340
Once again, notice the speed of a-1000 and duplex of a-full.
663.930
On a real Cisco device, this will be 1000 and full, without the A, because these settings
669.160
were manually configured, not autonegotiated.
672.020
Finally, let’s save the configurations. END.
677.510
This time, I’ll just use ‘WRITE’ to save the configuration. Now let’s check. Show startup-config.
685.940
Looks like our configuration changes were applied.
688.630
That’s all for this lab.
