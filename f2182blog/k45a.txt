is really a review of material we have

practiced in the icnd1 labs VLANs trunks

and DTP however these topics are in the

icnd2 exam topics as well so let's

review them one more time the first step

is to disable negotiation of trunk ports

and manually configure the mode of each

switch port in use DTP can dynamically

determine whether a switch port should

be a trunk or an access port for example

if you connect a switch port to a port

on another switch that is a trunk the

switch port will become a trunk as well

let's check on switch 1 and switch 2 I

haven't done any configuration yet so

DTP is enabled on both and there should

be an access mode at the moment I'll go

on switch 1 enable show interface g0 to

switchboard see it's in dynamic auto

mode by default meaning if it's

connected to a trunk or a port in

dynamic desireable mode it will become a

trunk port as well however really these

configuration should all be done

manually

for security reasons also Saudi TP is

something you should always disable just

to show you the commands however compte

interface g0 to switch port mode dynamic

and let's check the options auto is as I

said before it will become a trunk port

if connected to a dynamic desirable port

and desirable mode actively tries to

form trunk ports with both auto and

other desirable mode ports let's do the

smart thing and disable DTP then

manually set the mode of each switch

port

so switchport no negotiate that disables

DTP switchport mode trunk

okay now let's configure switch ones

other ports g1 should be a trunk as it

leads to r1 for inter VLAN routing and F

0 1 and F 0 2 should be access ports

interface G 0 1 switch port mode trunk

switch port no negotiate interface range

F 0 1 2 - switch port mode access switch

port no negotiate ok let's go to switch

to now enable look at this message we

got on switch to blocking Gigabit

Ethernet 0 1 inconsistent port type

switch ones G 0 2 interface is a trunk

however because DTP is disabled it's not

sending packets to switch to so that

switch twos dynamic G user 1 interface

can become a trunk as well therefore

well switch ones G 0 2 interface is a

trunk switch to SG 0 1 interface remains

an access port so there is an

inconsistent port type let's make this a

trunk to compte interface G 0 1 switch

port mode trunk switch port no negotiate

okay next interface range F 0 1 - 2

switch port mode access switch port no

negotiate okay that's all for step 1

step 2 is to assign the pcs to the

correct VLANs pc1 & pc2 P&V line 13 and

PC 2 and PC for should be in VLAN 24 I'm

on switched to now so let's assign PC 3

and PC for to the correct VLANs

interface F 0 1 switch port access VLAN

13 interface F 0 to switch port access

VLAN 24 now let's go back to switch 1

interface f01 switch port access VLAN 13

interface f02 switch for access VLAN 24

okay we have assigned the PCs to the

correct VLANs r1 has already been

configured for inter VLAN routing let's

just check the configuration enable

shall run the gig 0/0 interface itself

has no IP address but I've configured

two sub interfaces one for each VLAN the

encapsulation dot1q command sets the

VLAN of the sub interface thirteen and

fourteen and then we set the IP address

for the sub interface make sure these

addresses are set as the default

gateways for the pcs I already configure

the pcs so everything should work fine

now let's try some pings from pc1 to

make sure we have connectivity let's

ping PC three first which is in the same

VLAN but connected to a different switch

pink 1300 13 it works okay and now let's

ping PC 2 which is in a different VLAN

but connected to the same switch ping

2400 12 it works so our inter VLAN

routing is working let's try to ping PC

4 as well in a different VLAN and

connected to a different switch ping

2400 14

it works too in this lab we took a brief

look at DTP disabled it and configured

VLANs and switch port mode that's all
