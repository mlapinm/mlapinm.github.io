lab we will configure ether channel

ether channel is used to aggregates

which interfaces to operate as a single

logical interface what is the advantage

of that well in the previous couple labs

we looked at spanning tree protocol as

you can tell by the port lights in

packet tracer only one link is active

between each switch we have four fast

ethernet links connecting to switch 1

and switch 2 for example but only one

link is actually forwarding information

those other links still provide

redundancy in case the f01 interface

fails for example but it would be better

if we could make use of them let's get

started the first part is to analyze

this topology from a spanning tree

perspective now you can tell all of this

by looking at the port lights and packet

tracer but let's use some show commands

to confirm which switch is the root

bridge well all of switched ones port

lights are on so there's our answer

let's go on switch one to confirm enable

show spanning tree ok this bridge is the

root so all of the interfaces here are

designated they're forwarding now how do

these other switches choose their route

ports whichever path they select the

route cost is the same and the

neighboring switches bridge ID is the

same so the next career the next

criteria and this is very important is

the neighbors port ID the port ID

consists of a port priority which is 128

by default and the port number the

lowest port ID wins and is selected as

the root port keep in mind this is the

neighbors

I D not the local switches port ID that

is why in this topology between switch 1

and switch 2 and between switch three

and switch 4 I connected F 0 1 to F 0

for f 0 2 to F 0 3 etc instead of F 0 1

to F 0 1 F 0 2 to F 0 2 to demonstrate

this from switch tunes perspective

switch ones F 0 1 has the lowest port ID

so it chooses its interface connected to

switch ones F 0 1 interface which is its

own F 0 4 interface as the root port the

same goes for switch 4 which also

selected its F 0 4 interface switch 3

chose its G 0 1 interface which is

connected to switch to is G 0 1

interface also because switch to SG 0 1

interface has a lower port ID then

switch to SG 0 2 interface so the

interfaces across from the reports are

designated now on the remaining links

how did the switches choose which side

would block and which side would

designate their ports that is the route

cost switch 2 is closer to switch 1 than

switch 3 so it's side of the link is

designated and switch 3 side is non

designated blocking and switch 3 is

closer to switch 1 then switch 4 is so

switch 3 side is designated and switched

4 side is non designated or blocking ok

so that was just another review of

spanning tree selection process it also

shows the reason we use ether channel we

want to take advantage of these

redundant links and have them all

available for use rather than waiting

for the active link to fail

so our first task is to configure a

layer 2 ether channel between switch 1

and switch to using a Cisco proprietary

protocol that protocol is port

aggregation protocol pagp let's go on

switch 1 and configure it

coffee tea interface range F 0 1 2 4

before I enter the commands I should

mention some requirements of ether

channel regardless of whether using pagp

or another method in all ports involved

must have the same configuration that is

the same duplex full or half the same

speed the same native and allowed VLANs

in the same switch port mode access or

trunk both of these switches have the

same configuration by default so that

won't be a problem here but keep that in

mind for the next troubleshooting lab so

regardless of the ether channel protocol

the command begins the same channel -

group followed by the group number this

is necessary in case you have multiple

ether channels on the same switch note

that this number doesn't have to match

the switch on the other end of the ether

Cannell let's go with one then mode and

this is where we determine the protocol

used pagp has two options desirable or

Auto much like DTP dynamic trunking

protocol desirable will actively form an

ether channel if the switch on the other

end is using desirable or Auto mode Auto

however will only form an ether channel

if the other end is desirable let's go

with desirable okay that's it do show

ether channel summary there is po1 port

channel one our new logical interface

notice the SD next to it s indicates a

layer two ether Channel and D means it

is down that's because we haven't

configured switch to yet here are the

ports included in it F 0 1 2 F 0 4 and

let's configure it as a trunk as for the

instructions interface port channel 1

switch port mode trunk ok let's do the

same configuration on switch 2's end and

then check if the ether channel is

working enable conf T interface range F

0 1 - 4 I'm just going to shut down

these interfaces while I work on the

ether

shut down I'll use a different channel

group number to show it will work even

if it doesn't match with switch one

channel group 2 mode and this time let's

go with Auto

although desirable would work as well

now let's make it a trunk interface po2

is pork channel 2 note on this switch

model both is l and dot1q encapsulations

are supported so we have to configure

the encapsulation first before making a

trunk switch port trunk encapsulation

dot1q switch port mode trunk

ok let's activate the interfaces

interface range F 0 1 2 4 no chef now

let's check if the ether channel is up

do show ether channel summary it's

probably a good idea to get familiar

with the meanings of these flag codes in

the output of this command but that's

just thinking in terms of possible test

questions although in a real scenario

you can just see them right here in the

output there it is s meaning layer 2 and

you meaning in use our next task is to

configure a layer 3 ether channel

between switch 2 and switch 3 you will

use layer 2 ether channels more than

layer 3 but you should know how to make

one let's start here on switch to exit

first enable IP routing on the switch to

give it layer 3 capabilities IP routing

now let's make the ether channel

interface range G 0 1 2 to use the no

switch port command first before making

the ether channel this will make the

interface layer 3 then let's make a

static ether channel channel Group 1

mode on is the command for a static

ether Channel next let's assign an IP

address to the interface interface po1

IP address 2300 1 255.255.255.0 ok let's

configure a switch 3 side

enable coffee/tea IP routing interface

range G 0 1 2 2 no switch port channel

Group 1 mode on interface po1 IP address

23:02 255.255.255.0 do show ether

channel summary notice that a layer 3

ether channel is indicated by r and

again there is that you for in use let's

try to ping across the ether channel to

switch to do ping

23:01 and it works

now we have one more ether channel to

configure this time we use an I Triple E

standard protocol that is link

aggregation control protocol LACP let's

start here on switch 3 interface range F

0 1 2 4 channel group 2 mode and let's

check our options Elysee pees equivalent

of PA gps desirable is active and le

psyches equivalent of PA gps auto is

passive let's go with active interface

po2 again on this switch model we have

to configure the encapsulation switch

port trunk encapsulation dot1q switch

port mode trunk

ok now let's configure the other end on

switch for enable coffee tea interface

range F 0 1 2 4 let's set it down for

now while we work shut channel Group 1

mode active since switch 3 side is

active passive would work as well by the

way interface po1 switch port mode trunk

interface range F 0 1 2 4 no shutdown

okay let's check if all is good do show

ether channel summary we have a layer

two ether channel and it is in use so we

created three ether channels one layer

two ether channel using pagp one static

layer three ether channel and one layer

two ether channel using LACP that's all
