00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:18,170
Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,699
In this video we’ll look at WAN architectures.

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:28,050
Specifically, we’ll be covering topic 1.2.d,
WAN, and topic 5.5, describe remote access

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,749
and site-to-site VPNs.

10
00:00:30,749 --> 00:00:36,620
Both of these exam topics use the term ‘describe’,
so we won’t be looking at any actual configurations.

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:42,470
You just need a basic understanding of some
common WAN technologies and how they operate.

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,100
Note that we’ll be looking at WANs from
the perspective of an enterprise which is

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,730
the customer of a service provider, not from
the perspective of the service provider itself.

14
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:57,260
To learn more about the service provider perspective,
consider the CCNP service provider certification

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,430
in the future.

16
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,940
Here’s what we’ll cover in this video.

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,850
First I’ll give an introduction to WANs
and explain what they are.

18
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,440
Then I’ll introduce one type of connection
used for WANs, known as leased lines.

19
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,280
Then another WAN technology known as MPLS,
multi protocol label switching, which provides

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,750
us with a kind of VPN, virtual private network.

21
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,490
Then I’ll introduce some options for internet
connectivity, and finally explain internet

22
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,350
VPNs, which allow us to create virtual private
networks over the public Internet.

23
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:37,470
So, we’ll cover a lot of topics, but we
won’t be going in depth about any of them.

24
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,770
To cover just the topic of MPLS in depth,
for example, would require a full course at

25
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,360
least as long as this entire CCNA course.

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,770
For the CCNA exam, all that’s expected is
that you have a basic understanding of these

27
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,810
technologies and their purpose.

28
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,120
As always, make sure to watch until the end
of the video for a bonus practice question

29
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:04,430
from Boson Software’s ExSim for CCNA, the
best practice exams for the CCNA.

30
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:09,229
Okay let me introduce the concept of WANs
first.

31
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:14,099
As you know already, WAN stands for Wide Area
Network, and the name should give you a good

32
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,450
idea of what a WAN is.

33
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,049
A WAN is a network that extends over a large
geographic area.

34
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:24,620
For example, between cities, between countries,
etc.

35
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,739
So, WANs are used to connect geographically
separate LANs.

36
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:34,219
For example, if a company has an office in
New York, an office in Toronto, and an office

37
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:40,299
in London, each of those offices is a LAN,
Local Area Network, and the connections between

38
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:44,090
them form a WAN, Wide Area Network.

39
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,969
Although the Internet itself can be considered
a WAN, the term WAN is typically used to refer

40
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:53,790
to an enterprise’s private connections that
connect their offices, data centers, and other

41
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,170
sites together.

42
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,640
So, as I said the Internet can be considered
a WAN, but when we say WAN we usually aren’t

43
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,709
referring to the Internet.

44
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:06,669
Although there is another kind of technology
that can be used over the Internet to create

45
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:08,750
private connections.

46
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:14,379
Over public and shared connections like the
Internet, VPNs, Virtual Private Networks,

47
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:16,579
can be used to create private connections.

48
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:20,799
I’ll show you a few kinds of VPNs in this
video.

49
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:24,489
Note that there have been many different WAN
technologies over the years.

50
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,560
Depending on the location, some will be available
and some will not be.

51
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,510
I won’t cover every possible WAN technology
in this video.

52
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:37,939
Also, technologies which are considered legacy
in one country might still be used in other

53
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:39,590
countries.

54
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,359
Legacy basically means old and no longer used
or rarely used.

55
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:47,669
Here’s an example of a WAN.

56
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:51,809
This enterprise has a central data center
and some offices.

57
00:03:51,809 --> 00:03:55,330
For the purpose of this video we’re not
focusing on the LAN so I won’t show all

58
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:01,389
of the devices in each LAN, but each of these,
office A, office B, office C, as well as the

59
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:04,419
data center, is its own LAN.

60
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:09,170
Each office is connected to the data center
via a leased line, which is a kind of dedicated

61
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,019
physical connection between two sites.

62
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:16,310
This is not a shared connection, it’s not
connected to the Internet, it’s a private

63
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,030
connection that the company uses to connect
its sites together.

64
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:24,810
By the way, do you know a word for this kind
of topology, in which multiple devices connect

65
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,940
to one central device?

66
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,590
In the last video I introduced the term star
topology, however when talking about WANs

67
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,690
a more common term is hub and spoke.

68
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:41,100
The central site, the data center, is called
the hub, and the office sites which all connect

69
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,750
to the hub are called spokes.

70
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:49,440
One major advantage of a hub-and-spoke topology,
as opposed to a full-mesh topology, is that

71
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,290
it’s easier to centrally control what traffic
is allowed and what isn’t.

72
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:59,520
All traffic between offices can be sent to
a firewall in the data center, for example,

73
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,900
and it can control which traffic is allowed
and which isn’t.

74
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,270
So, remember that term, hub and spoke topology.

75
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,830
Now, I have to say that this diagram is actually
not exactly an accurate representation of

76
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,229
leased lines.

77
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:17,370
This is a better representation of what’s
actually going on.

78
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,620
Rather than a single physical cable directly
connecting each site, each site connects to

79
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,189
a service provider, which connects the sites
together.

80
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:30,699
I will introduce leased lines soon, but these
connections use serial cables.

81
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:36,250
I briefly introduced serial connections in
the OSPF section of the course, they use Layer

82
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,800
2 encapsulations like HDLC and PPP, not Ethernet.

83
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,830
However these days WAN connections via Ethernet
are more and more common.

84
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:52,990
Optical fiber connections allow much longer
cables than the traditional copper UTP Ethernet

85
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,569
cables, so these days WANs using Ethernet
fiber optic cables are quite common.

86
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:03,620
Note that the CCNA focuses on the WAN connection
from the perspective of the enterprise, not

87
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,300
the service provider.

88
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,500
So we won’t spend much time talking about
exactly what’s going on inside of the service

89
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,259
provider network, the gray box in this slide
and the previous one.

90
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:19,180
If you want to learn more about that, consider
the CCNP service provider track in your future

91
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,250
studies.

92
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,639
Now, the Internet can also be used for an
enterprise’s WAN connections between sites.

93
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,080
However, the Internet itself is not a private
network.

94
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,469
It’s a shared, public network, so sending
important data over the Internet unprotected

95
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:36,470
is not a good idea.

96
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,320
In this case, note that each site has a physical
connection to the Internet.

97
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,700
However, to send traffic between sites the
company will set up VPNs, virtual private

98
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,700
networks.

99
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:52,110
We’ll cover these in greater detail soon,
but basically the packets will be encrypted

100
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,889
so that the contents can only be read by the
intended recipients.

101
00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:01,129
Then, the encrypted packet is encapsulated
within a new packet and sent.

102
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:06,430
This means that the original packet will remain
protected even when sent over the public Internet.

103
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,110
Okay, so that was a quick introduction to
a few WAN options.

104
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:16,240
Now let’s take a slightly deeper look at
each one, starting with leased lines.

105
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,360
A leased line is a dedicated physical link,
typically connecting two sites.

106
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,660
As I mentioned before, they use serial connections
with PPP or HDLC encapsulation.

107
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,879
So, these aren’t Ethernet links.

108
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:35,419
The layer 2 encapsulation is not Ethernet,
but rather PPP or HDLC.

109
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:39,590
There are various standards that provide different
speeds, and different standards are available

110
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,740
in different countries.

111
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,710
This chart from Wikipedia shows some of the
standards.

112
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,979
Now, there are a lot here and I don’t think
you need to memorize them all.

113
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:53,300
Of course, if you want you can make flashcards
to try to memorize all of these standards

114
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,289
and their speeds, but I think that will be
unnecessary for the CCNA exam.

115
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:00,499
Let me just point out a few.

116
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:06,639
In North America the standard names begin
with T, as in T1, T2, and T3.

117
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,200
I will include flashcards for these three
in the deck I provide, but keep in mind no

118
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,300
one except a few people at Cisco know exactly
what will be asked on the exam so it’s up

119
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,979
to you if you want to memorize more or not.

120
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:26,759
In Europe, as well as other regions, the standards
begin with E, for example E1, E2, and E3.

121
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,530
Again, I will include flashcards for these
three standards.

122
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:36,000
Now, as I mentioned before Ethernet WAN technologies
are becoming more and more popular, rather

123
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,270
than these serial leased lines.

124
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,270
Why is that?

125
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:44,510
It’s because leased lines tend to have a
higher cost, higher installation lead time,

126
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,700
meaning it takes a longer time to actually
install the line, and they also have slower

127
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,680
speeds than Ethernet connections provide.

128
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,970
Okay let’s move on to another WAN option,
MPLS.

129
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,120
MPLS stands for Multi Protocol Label Switching.

130
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,370
Similar to the Internet, service providers’
MPLS networks are shared infrastructure because

131
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:12,090
many customer enterprises connect to and share
the same infrastructure to make WAN connections.

132
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:18,070
However, the label switching in the name of
MPLS allows VPNs, virtual private networks,

133
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:23,690
to be created over the MPLS infrastructure
through the use of labels.

134
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,880
These labels are used to separate the traffic
of different customers as it travels over

135
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,850
the shared infrastructure, and make sure it
doesn’t mix with the traffic of other customers.

136
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,950
There are a few basic terms you should know
for MPLS.

137
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,450
CE router means Customer Edge router.

138
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:45,190
This is the customer’s router that is connected
to the next kind of router, PE router, which

139
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,700
means Provider Edge router.

140
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,070
Finally there are P routers, these are the
Provider core routers that are not at the

141
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,100
edge of the network and don’t connect to
customer routers.

142
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,020
This diagram should make it easier to understand.

143
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,370
Notice the CE routers are at the edge of the
customer networks, and they connect to the

144
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,370
PE routers, the provider edge routers.

145
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,440
Within the provider network there are also
P routers which form the internal network

146
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,380
infrastructure of the service provider’s
network, but don’t connect directly to the

147
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,390
customer routers.

148
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:24,350
When the PE routers receive frames from the
CE routers, they add a label to the frame.

149
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:29,620
This label is actually placed in between the
Layer 2 Ethernet header and the Layer 3 IP

150
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:35,200
header, so sometimes MPLS is called a Layer
2.5 protocol.

151
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,580
These labels are then used to make forwarding
decisions within the service provider network,

152
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,200
not the destination IP.

153
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,290
In regular IP routing the router checks the
destination IP and compares it to its routing

154
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,460
table to decide where to forward the packet.

155
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,000
But not in MPLS.

156
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,540
MPLS routers use the MPLS label to decide
where to forward the packet.

157
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:04,320
Now, the CE routers do not use MPLS, it is
only used by the PE and P routers.

158
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,650
The CE routers do not have to run MPLS or
even be able to run MPLS.

159
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:15,550
Now, there are a few different kinds of VPNs
that can be provided by MPLS.

160
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:23,180
When using a Layer 3 MPLS VPN, the CE and
PE routers peer using OSPF for example, to

161
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,760
share routing information.

162
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,660
Now, it doesn’t have to be OSPF, it could
be another routing protocol.

163
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:35,040
Or the customer could just write static routes,
using the PE routers as the next hop.

164
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,070
But let’s assume a routing protocol is being
used.

165
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:45,640
For example, in the diagram below office A’s
CE will peer with one PE, and office B’s

166
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,520
CE will peer with the other PE, like this.

167
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:55,110
Then, office A’s CE will learn about office
B’s routes via this OSPF peering, and office

168
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,690
B’s CE will learn about office A’s routes,
too.

169
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,000
So, this is a Layer 3 MPLS VPN.

170
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,930
The CE routers either form dynamic routing
protocol peerings with the PE routers, or

171
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,640
they use the PE routers as the next hop of
their static routes.

172
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:19,500
A Layer 2 MPLS VPN can also be used, in which
the CE and PE routers do not form peerings.

173
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,230
So, the entire service provider network is
transparent to the CE routers.

174
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:30,420
Although the CE routers will physically connect
to a PE router, it is in effect like the two

175
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,190
CE routers are directly connected.

176
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,600
Their WAN interfaces will be in the same subnet.

177
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,930
If a routing protocol is used, the two CE
routers will peer directly with each other

178
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,780
like this.

179
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:47,720
In this case, the service provider network
is still running MPLS just like before, but

180
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,940
it’s doing so in a way that it’s like
the entire service provider network is just

181
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,370
a big switch connecting the two CE routers
together like this.

182
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:01,060
The CE routers are physically connected to
the PE routers, and the entire PE network

183
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:05,430
is operating like a big switch connecting
the CE routers together.

184
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:12,290
Now, MPLS is a technology that runs in the
service provider network, but many different

185
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,700
technologies, many different kinds of connections,
can be used to actually connect to the service

186
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,430
provider’s MPLS network for WAN service.

187
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:25,570
In this case office A and office B are connecting
via fiber optic Ethernet.

188
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:31,590
Perhaps office C is connecting to the service
provider via wireless 4G or 5G.

189
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:37,610
Office D might be connecting via CATV, a cable
TV connection as is often used for home Internet

190
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,310
access.

191
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:44,640
And office E might use a serial connection,
a leased line to connect to the service provider’s

192
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,290
MPLS infrastructure.

193
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:52,030
So, these sites are connecting to the service
provider with a variety of connection types,

194
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:56,500
and they will all be able to communicate with
each other over the service provider’s MPLS

195
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
infrastructure.

196
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,640
Okay, that’s all for MPLS.

197
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:07,450
For the CCNA exam, you should know that MPLS
uses labels to forward traffic, not IP addresses.

198
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:12,060
You should know the terms CE router, PE router,
and P router.

199
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:17,970
You should know that Layer 3 MPLS VPNs have
CE routers and PE routers forming peerings

200
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:24,990
using a routing protocol such as OSPF, whereas
in Layer 2 MPLS VPNs it is as if the CE routers

201
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,410
are all directly connected to each other.

202
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:32,530
The service provider routers are totally transparent,
acting like a big switch connecting the CE

203
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,240
routers together.

204
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,290
As I mentioned at the beginning of this video,
just the topic of MPLS alone would require

205
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:45,000
a huge course to cover in depth, but let’s
move on now to talk about the Internet.

206
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,660
Before focusing on Internet VPNs, let’s
take a look at Internet connections in general.

207
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,540
There are countless ways for an enterprise
to connect to the Internet.

208
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:00,130
For example, private WAN technologies such
as leased lines and MPLS VPNs can be used

209
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,980
to connect to a service provider’s Internet
infrastructure.

210
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,810
Although the leased line or MPLS VPN itself
is a private network, it can be used as a

211
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,860
means to access the public network that is
the Internet.

212
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:18,510
In addition, technologies such as CATV and
DSL, which are commonly used by consumers

213
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:22,530
for home Internet access, can also be used
by an enterprise.

214
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:28,290
I’m repeating myself, but for both enterprise
and consumer internet access, fiber optic

215
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,250
ethernet connections are growing in popularity
due to the high speeds they provide over long

216
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,890
distances.

217
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:39,370
But now let’s briefly look at two Internet
access technologies that I mentioned above,

218
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,280
cable Internet and DSL.

219
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,480
First let’s look at DSL, which stands for
Digital Subscriber Line.

220
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,950
DSL provides internet connectivity to customers
over phone lines, and can share the same phone

221
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,660
line that is already installed in most homes.

222
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,470
So, this is very convenient for both the service
provider and the customer.

223
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,870
Now, there is one extra device here that I
haven’t really talked about in this course

224
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,830
except for a brief mention in the previous
video.

225
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,980
That is the modem.

226
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:15,000
A modem, which stands for modulator-demodulator,
is required to convert data into a format

227
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,190
suitable to be sent over the phone lines.

228
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,880
The modem might be a separate device, as in
the diagram, or it might be incorporated into

229
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,690
the home router.

230
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:29,140
This connects the network to the service provider
over the phone lines.

231
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,230
But there is another common kind of communication
line installed in most homes that can also

232
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,770
be used for Internet access.

233
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,370
Let’s look at that next.

234
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,650
Cable Internet is a similar concept to DSL,
although of course if you look at the technical

235
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,420
details it is different.

236
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:51,540
But it provides Internet access via the same
CATV, cable television, lines used for TV

237
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,540
service.

238
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:59,870
So, just like DSL, it takes advantage of already-installed
lines and provides Internet access over them.

239
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:05,400
Like DSL, a cable modem is required to convert
data into a format suitable to be sent over

240
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,970
the CATV cables.

241
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:13,060
And also like a DSL modem, the cable modem
can be a separate device or built into the

242
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,760
home router.

243
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,339
Now, for a home user, having one connection
to the Internet isn’t a problem.

244
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:24,540
It’s a bit annoying if you lose Internet
access, but it’s not a disaster.

245
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,730
However, for many companies Internet access
is essential to their operations.

246
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:33,500
So, it’s best to have redundant Internet
connections, and there are a few terms you

247
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,780
should know.

248
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:40,920
First, if you have 1 connection to 1 ISP,
it’s called single homed.

249
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,020
This is like a standard home Internet connection.

250
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:49,030
For an enterprise, this is not ideal, because
there is no redundancy here.

251
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,770
If you have 2 connections to that same ISP,
it’s called dual homed.

252
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,850
This provides some redundancy, but still not
ideal.

253
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:02,590
If you have 1 connection to each of 2 ISPs,
it’s called multihomed.

254
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:07,370
This improves the redundancy because if something
happens to 1 ISP, you still have Internet

255
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,870
access via the other one.

256
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:15,240
And finally there is dual multihomed, 2 connections
to each of 2 ISPs.

257
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,660
This provides the most redundancy.

258
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,910
Depending on the company, this might not be
necessary or worth the cost.

259
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,820
So, make sure you know these four terms.

260
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,960
Single homed, dual homed, multihomed, and
dual multihomed.

261
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,050
Okay, that’s enough about Internet access
for now.

262
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:37,710
Let’s move on to the final topic, Internet
VPNs.

263
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:43,390
Private WAN services such as leased lines
and MPLS provide security because each customer’s

264
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:49,240
traffic is separated by using dedicated physical
connections, as in leased lines, or by MPLS

265
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,240
tags that separate the traffic.

266
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,770
However, when using the Internet as a WAN
to connect sites together, there is no built-in

267
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,440
security by default.

268
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,840
So, to provide secure communications over
a shared network like the Internet, VPNs (virtual

269
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,660
private networks) are used.

270
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,350
We will cover two kinds of Internet VPNs.

271
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:18,030
First, site-to-site VPNs using IPsec, and
second, remote-access VPNs using TLS.

272
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:23,320
So let’s get right into the first one, site-to-site
VPNs using IPsec.

273
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,990
A site-to-site VPN is a VPN between two devices
and is used to connect two sites together

274
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,110
over the Internet.

275
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:36,180
In the diagram below office A and office B
are both connected to the Internet, and we

276
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:41,460
will use a site-to-site VPN between them so
that the devices at each office can communicate

277
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,910
securely with each other.

278
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:49,650
In a site-to-site VPN, a VPN tunnel is created
between the two devices by encapsulating the

279
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:55,060
original IP packet with a VPN header and a
new IP header.

280
00:19:55,060 --> 00:20:01,070
When using IPsec, the original packet is encrypted
before being encapsulated with the new header.

281
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,490
This is what makes IPsec secure.

282
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:09,231
So, the router will take the original packet,
encrypt it so that it can’t be read, add

283
00:20:09,231 --> 00:20:15,070
an IPsec VPN header and a new IP header, and
then forward it over the Internet.

284
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:18,020
Let me demonstrate that process in the diagram.

285
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,790
We have configured an IPsec tunnel between
these two routers.

286
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:27,430
The PC at office A wants to send traffic to
the PC at office B, so it first sends the

287
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:31,260
unencrypted data to its default gateway, the
router.

288
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:36,770
The router encrypts the data, and adds a VPN
header and new IP header.

289
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,910
Then the encrypted data in the new packet
is sent over the Internet to the other end

290
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,600
of the tunnel.

291
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,250
The receiving router decrypts the data, and
sends it to the destination PC.

292
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,780
That’s a very basic overview of how IPsec
VPNs work.

293
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,730
Let’s summarize that process.

294
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,740
When the router receives a packet that is
to be sent over the VPN, it combines the original

295
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:06,610
packet and a session key, also called an encryption
key, and runs them through an encryption formula.

296
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,700
Then the sending device, the router, encapsulates
the encrypted packet with a VPN header and

297
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,250
a new IP header.

298
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:17,710
The new packet is then sent to the device
on the other end of the tunnel, the receiving

299
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,210
router.

300
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,720
This device then decrypts the data to get
the original packet, and forwards it to its

301
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,630
destination.

302
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:30,040
Of course, this is an oversimplification of
the process, but at this point in your studies

303
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,490
that is okay.

304
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:37,920
Now, note that in a site-to-site VPN a tunnel
is formed only between two tunnel endpoints,

305
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,480
for example the two routers connected to the
Internet.

306
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,270
All other devices in each site don’t need
to create a VPN for themselves.

307
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:50,650
They can send unencrypted data to their site’s
router, which will encrypt it and forward

308
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,600
it in the tunnel as described above.

309
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,570
The next type of VPN we will look at, remote
access VPNs, is different.

310
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,000
Before looking at remote-access VPNs, I want
to point out a few limitations of standard

311
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,170
IPsec.

312
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:11,270
First, IPsec doesn’t support broadcast and
multicast traffic, only unicast.

313
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:15,590
This means that routing protocols such as
OSPF can’t be used over the tunnels, because

314
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,920
routing protocols rely on multicast traffic.

315
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,560
We can solve this with GRE over IPsec, which
we’ll look at next.

316
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,600
Another potential problem for large networks
is that configuring a full mesh of tunnels

317
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,900
between many sites is a labor-intensive task.

318
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,610
It takes a lot of time and careful planning
to configure dozens of VPNs.

319
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,210
This problem can be solved with Cisco’s
DMVPN.

320
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,680
Let’s briefly look at each of the above
solutions.

321
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,480
First, GRE over IPsec.

322
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,681
GRE, which stands for Generic Routing Encapsulation,
creates tunnels like IPsec, but it does not

323
00:22:51,681 --> 00:22:55,600
encrypt the original packet, so it is not
secure.

324
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,750
However it has the advantage of being able
to encapsulate a wide variety of Layer 3 protocols

325
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,630
as well as broadcast and multicast messages.

326
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:11,870
So, to get the flexibility of GRE with the
security of IPsec, GRE over IPsec can be used.

327
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:17,140
The original packet will be encapsulated by
a GRE header and a new IP header, and then

328
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:23,050
the GRE packet will be encrypted and encapsulated
within an IPsec VPN header and a new IP header.

329
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,860
So, here’s the original IP packet.

330
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,150
A GRE header and new IP header are added to
it.

331
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:35,420
Then this new packet is encrypted, and an
IPsec header and new IP header are added.

332
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,580
We have combined GRE with IPsec.

333
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,410
That’s all I’ll say about GRE over IPsec
for now.

334
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,910
You don’t need to know more than this for
the CCNA.

335
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:50,500
Now, regarding the problem of configuring
full-mesh IPsec tunnels, let’s look at DMVPN.

336
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:56,929
DMVPN, which stands for Dynamic Multipoint
VPN, is a Cisco-developed solution that allows

337
00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:01,650
routers to dynamically create a full mesh
of IPsec tunnels without having to manually

338
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,059
configure every single tunnel.

339
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:08,800
This is a major oversimplification, but let
me demonstrate it in two steps.

340
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,960
First, you configure IPsec tunnels to a hub
site.

341
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,470
Notice that the router at the top is the hub,
and each spoke router has an IPsec tunnel

342
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:20,880
to that hub router, but not to the other spoke
routers.

343
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,600
That’s part 1.

344
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,730
Then, the hub router gives each router information
about how to form an IPsec tunnel with the

345
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,860
other routers.

346
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:34,170
So, we only configured hub-and-spoke tunnels,
but the routers were able to form a full mesh

347
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,650
of IPsec tunnels on their own.

348
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:42,540
To summarize, DMVPN provides the configuration
simplicity of hub-and-spoke, meaning each

349
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:48,429
router only needs one tunnel to be configured,
and the efficiency of spoke-to-spoke communication,

350
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:53,820
because spoke routers can communicate directly
without traffic passing through the hub.

351
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:58,230
Some companies might want all traffic to flow
through the hub site so that a central firewall

352
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,950
can control the traffic, but other companies
might want the efficient direct spoke-to-spoke

353
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,980
communication that a full mesh provides.

354
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:12,809
Now let’s move on to the other major type
of VPN, remote-access VPNs.

355
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:16,830
Whereas site-to-site VPNs are used to make
a point-to-point connection between two sites

356
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:23,110
over the Internet, remote VPNs are used to
allow end devices such as PCs and mobile phones

357
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:27,450
to access the company’s internal resources
securely over the Internet.

358
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:33,720
Remote-access VPNs typically use TLS, transport
layer security, as opposed to site-to-site

359
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,950
VPNs which typically use IPsec.

360
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,530
TLS is also what provides security for HTTPS,
HTTP secure.

361
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:47,690
It was formerly known as SSL, Secure Sockets
Layer and developed by Netscape, but it was

362
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:51,480
renamed to TLS when it was standardized by
the IETF.

363
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:59,240
VPN client software, for example Cisco AnyConnect,
is installed on end devices, for example company-provided

364
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,150
laptops that employees use to work from home.

365
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:07,370
If you work for a company from home, your
device almost certainly has a kind of VPN

366
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,860
client software installed.

367
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,230
These end devices then form secure tunnels
to one of the company’s routers or firewalls

368
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,990
acting as a TLS server.

369
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:21,720
This allows the end users to securely access
resources on the company’s internal network

370
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,250
without being directly connected to the company
network.

371
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,790
Here’s a diagram to help you visualize it.

372
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:33,390
The end devices on the left want to access
resources on the company’s server in the

373
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,470
data center on the right.

374
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,800
They all have Cisco AnyConnect installed,
and it is also configured on the firewall

375
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,100
at the data center.

376
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:46,820
So, the devices each form a TLS VPN tunnel
to the firewall, and then they are able to

377
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:51,860
securely communicate with the company’s
internal servers through the tunnel.

378
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:58,231
Note that, just like IPsec, TLS involves encrypting
packets and adding additional headers, but

379
00:26:58,231 --> 00:27:00,990
for the sake of time we’ll skip over those
details.

380
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:07,470
So, finally let’s briefly compare site-to-site
and remote-access VPNs.

381
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:13,770
Site-to-site VPNs typically use IPsec, and
remote-access VPNs typically use TLS.

382
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:18,110
Both of them are protocols that you don’t
need to know in detail for the CCNA exam,

383
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:24,020
but you should definitely know their names
and have a basic understanding of their purposes.

384
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,620
Site-to-site VPNs provide service to many
devices within the sites they are connecting.

385
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,760
One IPsec tunnel between two routers or firewalls
provides traffic security for all hosts within

386
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,000
the sites they are connecting.

387
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,160
On the other hand, remote-access VPNs provide
service to the one end device the VPN client

388
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,350
software is installed on.

389
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:49,090
Instead of connecting two sites together,
they connect one end device to a site.

390
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:54,700
Site-to-site VPNs are typically used to permanently
connect two sites securely over the Internet.

391
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,850
And remote-access VPNs are typically used
to provide on-demand access for end devices

392
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:04,260
that want to securely access company resources
while connected to a network which is not

393
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,130
secure.

394
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:11,059
These two types of VPNs are specifically mentioned
in the CCNA exam topics, so make sure you

395
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:13,250
know the differences between them.

396
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:18,640
Okay, before moving on to the quiz let’s
review what we covered.

397
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,340
This video was just a shallow look at various
different WAN technologies.

398
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,960
Each topic in this video is very important
for network engineers to understand, but when

399
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,320
you’re just starting your journey you don’t
have to learn all of the details right away,

400
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,610
and the CCNA exam doesn’t expect you to
know them all.

401
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:38,480
So, first I introduced WANs.

402
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,740
Wide Area Networks are used to connect geographically
distant LANs, Local Area Networks, together.

403
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:50,030
For example, to connect two offices together
which are located in different cities or countries.

404
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:53,370
Then, we looked at leased lines.

405
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:57,600
Leased lines are dedicated physical connections
that can be used to connect sites together

406
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,560
to form a WAN.

407
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,560
For many reasons they are being replaced by
newer technologies, but you should still know

408
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,550
about them.

409
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,130
Then we looked at MPLS VPNs.

410
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:14,690
MPLS allows enterprises to form WANs over
a service provider’s MPLS infrastructure.

411
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:19,100
Although the traffic of many different customers
will be passing over this infrastructure,

412
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:25,580
the label-switching aspect of MPLS allows
secure VPNs to be formed over the shared infrastructure.

413
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:30,500
If you want to really learn how MPLS works,
consider the CCNP service provider track in

414
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
the future.

415
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:38,940
Then we looked at a few ways to connect to
the Internet, for example DSL and cable Internet.

416
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:45,880
And finally Internet VPNs, specifically site-to-site
VPNs using IPsec and remote-access VPNs using

417
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,610
TLS.

418
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:51,890
These provide secure connectivity over the
Internet, which is a shared public network

419
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,460
and not secure by default.

420
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,960
Make sure to watch until the end of the quiz
for a bonus question from Boson Software’s

421
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,930
ExSim for CCNA, the best practice exams for
the CCNA.

422
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:08,170
Okay, let’s go to quiz question 1.

423
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:14,030
Which of the following leased line standards
provides 1.544 Mbps of bandwidth?

424
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:20,610
Pause the video now to select the correct
answer.

425
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,540
The answer is B, T1.

426
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,840
Here’s that wikipedia chart again.

427
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,210
I doubt that you’ll have to memorize all
of these for the CCNA exam, but it doesn’t

428
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,860
hurt to be familiar with them.

429
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,640
Okay, let’s go to quiz question 2.

430
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:39,800
Jeremy’s IT Lab Professional IT Training
Inc. uses an MPLS VPN to connect its various

431
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,760
offices together.

432
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,720
Which of the following routers does NOT run
MPLS?

433
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,710
Pause the video to select the correct answer.

434
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,270
The answer is C, CE.

435
00:30:53,270 --> 00:31:00,610
In MPLS, PE, provider edge, and P, provider
core routers run MPLS to provide MPLS VPN

436
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,940
services for their customers.

437
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,890
However, there is no need for the CE, customer
edge, routers to run MPLS.

438
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:13,210
Okay, let’s go to question 3.

439
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:18,720
Which of the following MPLS VPN types allows
CE routers to directly form OSPF peerings

440
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,130
with each other?

441
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,490
Pause the video to select the best answer.

442
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:31,190
Okay, the answer is A, Layer 2 MPLS VPN.

443
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:35,940
Although MPLS is sometimes called a Layer
2.5 protocol because the labels are inserted

444
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:42,820
between the Layer 2 and Layer 3 headers, there
is no such thing as a Layer 2.5 MPLS VPN.

445
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:49,049
And in Layer 3 MPLS VPNs, the OSPF peerings
would be made with PE routers, not between

446
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:51,150
CE routers.

447
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:57,350
In a Layer 2 MPLS VPN, the entire service
provider network is transparent to the customer,

448
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:02,110
and it is as if the service provider network
is a switch connecting the two CE routers

449
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,110
together.

450
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:07,690
Okay, let’s go to question 4.

451
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:12,559
Which of the following Internet access technologies
takes advantage of already-installed phone

452
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,559
lines?

453
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:17,480
Pause the video to select the best answer.

454
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,679
Okay, the answer is B, DSL.

455
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:27,250
Digital Subscriber Line provides connectivity
to a service provider’s Internet infrastructure

456
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:32,340
over phone lines, which are typically already
installed in most modern homes.

457
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:37,210
As a bonus, it allows users to access the
Internet and use the phone at the same time,

458
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:41,780
which was not allowed in previous technologies
that used the phone lines for Internet access.

459
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:45,740
Okay, let’s go to question 5.

460
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,950
Which of the following protocols can be used
in combination with IPsec to provide more

461
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:54,540
flexibility by allowing multicast traffic
to be forwarded in the tunnel?

462
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,850
Pause the video now to select the best answer.

463
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:03,750
Okay, the answer is C, GRE.

464
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:09,100
Generic Routing Encapsulation is more flexible
than IPsec because it allows multicast as

465
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,720
well as broadcast packets to be encapsulated
and sent in the tunnel.

466
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,929
However, GRE isn’t secure because it doesn’t
encrypt the original packet.

467
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:23,900
So, the GRE packet can be encrypted and then
encapsulated using IPsec to provide the benefits

468
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,010
of both IPsec and GRE.

469
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,090
Okay, that’s all for the quiz.

470
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:47,419
Now let’s take a look at a bonus question
from Boson Software’s ExSim for CCNA.
