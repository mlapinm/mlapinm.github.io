00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,160
Welcome to Jeremy’s IT Lab.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,420
This is a free, complete course for the CCNA.

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,990
Also, please like and leave a comment, and
share the video to help spread this free series

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,259
of videos.

6
00:00:18,259 --> 00:00:19,560
Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,109
Also, remember to download this practice lab
from the link in the description and try it

8
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:27,829
out yourself in packet tracer.

9
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:32,630
If you want more labs like these, I highly
recommend picking up Boson’s NetSim for

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,970
the CCNA, click the link in the video description
to check it out.

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:41,870
It’s a network simulator like packet tracer,
but it’s even better, you can use it up

12
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:48,460
to CCNP level even, whereas Packet Tracer
is too limited to do much beyond CCNA-level.

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:54,170
Here, you can see all of the labs available
NetSim for CCNA.

14
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,940
These are all detailed, guided labs that not
only help you practice what you’ve learned,

15
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:05,689
but really test your understanding, so I think
NetSim is a fantastic study tool for the CCNA.

16
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:09,020
If you want more practice relevant to what
we’re covering now at this point in the

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,470
course, look here in the ‘network access’
section.

18
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:19,310
VLANs, Trunking, this is all stuff you’ve
been studying over the past few videos.

19
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:24,889
Make sure to stick around to the end of this
video for a preview of one of these labs.

20
00:01:24,889 --> 00:01:29,670
If you want to grab a copy of NetSim for CCNA,
follow the link in the video description,

21
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,770
I highly recommend it.

22
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,350
Okay, let’s get started with today’s lab.

23
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:40,909
First off, all of these devices are preconfigured
so they are like they were at the end of Day

24
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:48,069
17’s lab, except SW2 has been replaced with
a Layer 3 switch, aka multilayer switch.

25
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:54,979
So, all of the hosts are already in the correct
VLANs, SW1 and SW2 are connected with a trunk,

26
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:59,119
and R1 and SW2 are connected using router
on a stick.

27
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,880
So what we’ll be doing is changing this
router on a stick configuration, to do inter-VLAN

28
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:10,640
routing via SVIs on SW2, just like in the
lecture video.

29
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,180
Step 1 is to replace the router on a stick
configuration with a point-to-point Layer

30
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,690
3 connection.

31
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:24,900
I’ll start on R1 first.  Enter privileged
exec mode with ENABLE, and then let’s do a few

32
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,900
show commands.

33
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,330
First, let’s check the running config of
G0/0 and it’s interfaces.

34
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,500
SHOW RUN.  By the way, you can press enter
to scroll through the running-config one line

35
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,970
at a time, or the spacebar to scroll one screen
at a time.

36
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:46,320
So, the physical interface itself has only
the default configurations, all I’ve done

37
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,630
is enable it with NO SHUTDOWN.

38
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,150
Under it you can see the three subinterfaces.

39
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,660
Let’s check the status of the interfaces.

40
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,550
SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.

41
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,180
G0/0 and its subinterfaces are all UP/UP.

42
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,300
Now, let’s remove the subinterfaces.

43
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:13,080
Enter global config mode with CONF T. Then
delete the subinterfaces with this command:

44
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,440
NO INTERFACE G0/0.10.

45
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,170
Then, hit the up arrow, and let’s change
this to .20.

46
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,630
And one more time, for .30.

47
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,360
Let’s check the config again.

48
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,710
DO SHOW RUN.  So, the subinterfaces have disappeared.

49
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,460
And let’s check their status.

50
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,680
DO SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.

51
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,060
Now, this is a difference between packet tracer,
and what I showed in the lecture video.

52
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:52,740
When I do the lecture videos, I used GNS3,
which runs actual Cisco IOS software, unlike

53
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,180
packet tracer, which is just a simulator.

54
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,819
On GNS3, the subinterfaces still appear with
a status of ‘DELETED’ until you restart

55
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:07,069
the device, but as you can see here they are
immediately removed in packet tracer.

56
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:12,930
Now, let’s configure G0/0 with an IP address.

57
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,380
INTERFACE G0/0.

58
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:22,280
IP ADDRESS 10.0.0.194 255.255.255.252.

59
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,590
Okay, that’s all we need to do on R1.

60
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:32,810
In the lecture video I did DEFAULT INTERFACE
G0/0 before configuring the IP address, but

61
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:38,440
that’s not actually necessary, since it
already has the default settings.

62
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:47,100
Okay, next let’s configure SW2’s G1/0/2 interface.  Enter
privileged exec mode with ENABLE.

63
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,570
And let’s check the config of G1/0/2.

64
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,870
SHOW RUN.  There it is.

65
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:02,870
Notice this layer 3 switch requires the SWITCHPORT
TRUNK ENCAPSULATION DOT1Q command.

66
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,660
The model of switch used in the previous lab didn’t require this.

67
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,630
Okay, let’s return the interface to the
default configuration.

68
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:20,960
Enter global config mode, CONF T. Then, DEFAULT INTERFACE G1/0/2.

69
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,181
When testing this lab out before I had to
do the command twice for it to work, that

70
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:29,070
might be a packet tracer issue, but I’ll
issue the command once more by using the up

71
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,340
arrow.

72
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,120
And next let’s check.

73
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,340
DO SHOW RUN.

74
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:39,380
Okay, so G1/0/2’s configurations have been
removed.

75
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,040
Let’s configure it.

76
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,400
INTERFACE G1/0/2.

77
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,880
Let’s try to add an IP address.

78
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,860
IP, then I'll use the question mark.

79
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,620
Notice there is no option for ADDRESS, why
is that?

80
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,419
It’s because this interface is still in
layer 2 mode.

81
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:04,380
Let’s put it into Layer 3 mode.

82
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,580
NO SWITCHPORT.

83
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,400
Okay, let’s try again.

84
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,720
IP, then question mark.

85
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,110
Now we have lots of options here, including
address, so let’s set the address.

86
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:24,000
ADDRESS 10.0.0.193 255.255.255.252.

87
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,680
Finally, let’s configure the default route
here on SW2.

88
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,740
EXIT.

89
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,430
And let’s check the current routing table.

90
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,400
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

91
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,310
No routes appear, even though we should have
connected and local routes for the interface

92
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,940
we configured, why is that?

93
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:48,310
It’s because we haven’t enabled IP ROUTING
on the switch yet, so let’s do that.

94
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,590
IP ROUTING.

95
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,250
And let’s view the routing table once again.

96
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,400
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

97
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Notice that only a connected route appears,
no local route.

98
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,060
When I showed you the command in the lecture
video, both routes appeared properly, connected and local.  So I

99
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,910
think this might be an issue with packet tracer,
a local router should appear here too.

100
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,180
Anyway, let’s configure that default route.

101
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:26,010
IP ROUTE 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0, and the next hop
is 10.0.0.194, R1’s address.

102
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,370
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

103
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,660
Okay, the default route has been added.

104
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,670
That’s all for step 1.

105
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,110
Step 2 is to configure the SVIs on SW2.

106
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,840
First off, let’s check if the necessary
VLANs exist.

107
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,290
Remember, an SVI won’t have a status of
UP/UP if its VLAN doesn’t exist.

108
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,110
DO SHOW VLAN BRIEF.

109
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,540
Okay, VLANs 10, 20, and 30 exist.

110
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,270
Let’s configure those SVIs, it’s fairly
simple.

111
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,460
INTERFACE VLAN 10.

112
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:08,500
Okay, the SVI has been created, now all we
have to do is assign the IP address, the last

113
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,320
usable address of the subnet in this case.

114
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:18,960
IP ADDRESS 10.0.0.62 255.255.255.192.

115
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,980
That’s it.

116
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,350
Let’s do VLAN 20.

117
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,000
INTERFACE VLAN 20.

118
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,880
IP ADDRESS 10.0.0.126 255.255.255.192.

119
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,400
Finally, VLAN 30.

120
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,760
INTERFACE VLAN 30.

121
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,840
IP ADDRESS 10.0.0.190 255.255.255.192.

122
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,760
EXIT.

123
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,060
Now let’s check if the interfaces are UP/UP.

124
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:58,930
DO SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.  Okay, looks good,
the VLAN10, 20, and 30 SVIs are all UP/UP.

125
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,960
So, our inter-VLAN routing should be functioning
now.

126
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,140
Let’s test by pinging between VLANs.

127
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:12,620
I’ll do a ping from PC7 in VLAN10 to PC3
in VLAN30.

128
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,310
First, in real time mode I’ll test the ping.

129
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:27,120
PING 10.0.0.129.

130
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,920
Okay, so the ping gets through.

131
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:34,620
I still get questions sometimes about why
the first one or two pings fail, that’s because

132
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,890
PC7 needs to ARP for the MAC address of its
default gateway, I’ve explained ARP in a

133
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,770
previous video.

134
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:47,560
Now let’s go into simulation mode to make
sure the traffic is NOT routed by R1, but

135
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,090
instead by SW2.

136
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,480
And let’s try that ping again.

137
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,990
PING 10.0.0.129.

138
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:03,070
Okay, notice that the ping goes to SW2, and
SW2 sends it directly to SW1, without having

139
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,010
to send it to R1.

140
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:12,570
That’s because SW2 routed it from the VLAN10
SVI to the VLAN30 SVI within its own software.

141
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,150
Okay, let’s return to realtime mode.

142
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:21,959
Finally, just to test if our default route
to R1 works, let’s try a ping to an address

143
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:26,110
in the Internet, 1.1.1.1.

144
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,740
Note that I already configured static routes
on R1 and the Internet router, so you don’t

145
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,480
have to configure anything else.

146
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,140
Let’s try that ping.

147
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:54,220
PING 1.1.1.1.

148
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,240
Okay, so the ping to the Internet works as well.

149
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,120
That’s all for this lab.

150
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,250
Okay let's move on to today's NetSim lab preview.

151
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:11,529
The lab I've chosen for today is InterVLAN
Routing 2, and I've already loaded it up so

152
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:15,350
let's get started.

153
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,830
The network topology is the same as last time.

154
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:23,030
One router, two switches, four PCs, but instead
of setting up the network we will troubleshoot

155
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,310
some problems on the network.

156
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,399
So, there are three lab tasks today.

157
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:32,690
Task 1, verify and correct workstation configurations.

158
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,630
These are the PCs.

159
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,180
Task 2, verify and correct switch configurations.

160
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,500
And task 3 is router configurations.

161
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,070
So, I think for today's preview we'll do task
1 and task 2.

162
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,870
So, task 1.

163
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:52,230
A user has reported that PC3 is unable to
ping any other device on the network, including

164
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,100
devices that reside on the same VLAN as PC3,
which is VLAN10.

165
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:06,339
Okay, so it looks like the devices in VLAN10
are PC1 and PC3.

166
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:09,870
And VLAN12, PC2 and PC4.

167
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,730
Okay, 1 and 3, VLAN10.

168
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:19,439
2 and 4, VLAN12, okay.

169
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:20,439
Here we are, okay.

170
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,820
And then there's some more explanation.

171
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,230
All steps in this task should be performed
on PC3.

172
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,880
Okay, let's go to step 1.

173
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,200
Verify the problem by attempting to ping every
other IP address on the network.

174
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,890
All pings should fail.

175
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:40,760
Okay, I won't ping every address but let's
go on PC3.

176
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,220
Still Router1, sorry.

177
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,470
PC3, console.

178
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,360
There we go.

179
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:55,110
And let's ping the default gateway, which
is 192.168.100.1, this subinterface on Router1.

180
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,560
And the ping should fail.

181
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,540
Yep, looks like it's failing.

182
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,580
Okay, I'll stop that.

183
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,400
How about PC1 in the same VLAN?

184
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:15,060
100.2.

185
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,740
Yep, that's failing as well.

186
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,540
And let's do one in VLAN12.

187
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:27,240
How about .130, which is PC2?

188
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,360
Okay.

189
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,040
So, all the pings are failing as expected.

190
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,830
Step 2, according to the network documentation
PC3 should operate in VLAN10.

191
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,670
Verify the IP address configuration.

192
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:47,410
Okay, so here is the correct configuration
for PC3.

193
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,440
Let's see what the actual current configuration
is.

194
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,080
IPCONFIG /ALL.

195
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,800
IP address is correct.

196
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:04,840
Subnet mask should be /25, ending in .128,
but this is /24, ending in .0.

197
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,720
So that is incorrect.

198
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,060
The default gateway is correct, however.

199
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:13,339
Okay, so the IP configuration is not correct.

200
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:15,920
Correct any IP address configuration problems
you find.

201
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:24,589
So, the way to set the IP address for a PC
in NetSim is this command here.

202
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:27,550
Note that this is just for PCs in NetSim.

203
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,180
IPCONFIG /IP (ip-address) (subnet-mask).

204
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:40,900
Okay, 192.168.100.3, and then the /25 prefix
length.

205
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,769
And let's confirm our configuration.

206
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:49,610
Okay, looks good.

207
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,740
Attempt to ping every other IP address on
the network.

208
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,130
Do all the pings succeed now?

209
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,770
Okay, let's do some more pings.

210
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:02,960
How about the default gateway?

211
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:09,660
100.1.

212
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,220
Okay, still fails.

213
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:20,440
How about PC1?

214
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,660
Okay, that still fails.

215
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:30,900
And we'll do one in VLAN12, PC2.

216
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,480
Okay, that still fails.

217
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,400
I'm using Ctrl-C to stop these pings, by the
way.

218
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:43,800
Okay, so we corrected IP address configuration,
but that didn't solve the problem.

219
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,730
Okay, task 2.

220
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:49,310
After verifying PC3's configuration in the
previous task, you should begin examining

221
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,810
other devices on the network to determine
whether other problems exist.

222
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,320
Okay, so step 1.

223
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,899
List two or more causes of inter-VLAN routing
problems on Layer 2 switches.

224
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:05,240
Okay, so this is something I really like about
NetSim.

225
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,970
It really tests your understanding by asking
good questions like this.

226
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,280
So, what are two possible problems?

227
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:21,640
Okay, one could be..perhaps the PC is in the
correct, sorry the incorrect VLAN.

228
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,320
It's supposed to be in VLAN10.

229
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,959
Maybe it's in VLAN12 or a totally different
VLAN.

230
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,920
So, that's one possible cause.

231
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
Let's do one more.

232
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:36,670
How about...this is probably a trunk connection
between the two switches, or it should be.

233
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,730
You might have forgotten the SWITCHPORT MODE
TRUNK command.

234
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,639
Or perhaps the correct VLANs are not allowed.

235
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,230
So maybe VLAN10 is not allowed on this trunk,
therefore PC3's traffic cannot pass between

236
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,430
the two switches.

237
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:54,790
Okay, so those are two possible causes.

238
00:16:54,790 --> 00:17:00,990
According to the network documentation, PC1
resides on the same VLAN as PC3.

239
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:07,000
From PC1 and PC3, attempt to ping each subinterface
on Router1.

240
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,500
What can you surmise from the results of these
pings?

241
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,220
Okay, so first from PC3.

242
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,600
Well, we already tried the ping but I'll just
do it one more time.

243
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:24,130
100.1.

244
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,709
This subinterface cannot be pinged from PC3.

245
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:29,340
Did it say both subinterfaces?

246
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,700
Yes, each subinterface on Router1, okay.

247
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,260
So the subinterface for VLAN12 should not
work also.

248
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:42,980
.129.

249
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,290
Okay, yes, the ping fails.

250
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:51,820
Now let's try from PC1, also in VLAN10.

251
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,980
192.168.100.1.

252
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,880
Okay, the ping works.

253
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,480
How about the other subinterface?

254
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,520
It works as well.

255
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,260
Okay, so PC3 cannot ping either subinterface.

256
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,750
PC1 can ping both.

257
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,160
So what can you surmise from that?

258
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:18,419
Well, I'd say the problem is either on Switch2
or in the connection between Switch1 and Switch2,

259
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:23,090
because Switch1 seems to be able to route
between the VLANs no problem.

260
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,820
Or, Switch1 doesn't do the routing, but Router
1 does the routing here.

261
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,600
But PC1 can ping through Switch1 to Router1.

262
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:37,450
PC3 cannot though, so there's either a problem
on Switch2 or on either Switch1 or Switch2

263
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:43,280
on this trunk connection here.

264
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,419
Okay next one, on Switch1, display VLAN information.

265
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:53,300
What ports are operating in the same VLAN
as PC1 and PC3?

266
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,220
Okay, Switch1, console.

267
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,530
ENABLE.

268
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:00,620
SHOW VLAN BRIEF is the command we want.

269
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,780
So, VLAN10 is the VLAN.

270
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:09,560
Only FastEthernet0/3, which I believe was
PC1's VLAN, yes.

271
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:15,480
So this configuration seems fine.

272
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,460
Yeah, so the answer is FastEthernet0/3.

273
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,290
On Switch1, display interface trunk information.

274
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,980
Which VLAN is the native VLAN and which ports
are trunk ports?

275
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:32,820
SHOW INTERFACES TRUNK.

276
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:42,400
Okay, so as expected FastEthernet0/1 and 0/2
are trunk ports and the native VLAN is 1 on

277
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,300
both, the default native VLAN.

278
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,480
Okay, and then go to Switch2, okay.

279
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,390
Switch2, ENABLE.

280
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:59,480
SHOW VLAN BRIEF.

281
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,260
Okay, so no ports are in VLAN10.

282
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,910
FastEthernet0/3 and 0/4 are both in VLAN12.

283
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,480
Okay, so let's go to number 6.

284
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,400
Based on the topology and IP address configurations,
which ports on Switch2 should be operating

285
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,290
in VLAN10?

286
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,309
That is probably FastEthernet0/3.

287
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:24,490
Yes, it is, so here is an issue.

288
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,380
PC3 in VLAN10, or should be in VLAN10.

289
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:35,669
But it is currently configured in VLAN12,
and its subnet is also the VLAN10 subnet.

290
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:39,370
So I think we're gonna have to change that.

291
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,570
There we go, step 8.

292
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:43,010
Or sorry, step 7.

293
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,470
What mode is Switch2's FastEthernet0/3 port
in?

294
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:51,710
Okay, so this is a command that I haven't
showed you yet.

295
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,340
SHOW INTERFACES F0/3 SWITCHPORT.

296
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,980
I don't think I've showed you it yet.

297
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:04,560
Administrative and operational mode are both
static access, so this is an access port.

298
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,650
It's been configured with the command 'SWITCHPORT
MODE ACCESS'.

299
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:12,680
So, that's the answer to number 7, access
mode.

300
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,200
Number 8, correct the VLAN configuration.

301
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,780
Okay, so that is easy.

302
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,360
CONF T. INTERFACE F0/3.

303
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:27,090
It should be in VLAN10, so SWITCHPORT ACCESS
VLAN 10.

304
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,919
And then number 9 is verify the new VLAN configuration.

305
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,750
DO SHOW VLAN BRIEF.

306
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,750
Okay, that's better.

307
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,820
FastEthernet0/3 is in VLAN10.

308
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:44,900
Next, number 10, on Switch2 display interface
trunk information.

309
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,200
Okay, DO SHOW INTERFACES TRUNK.

310
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,240
So, FastEthernet0/1 is a trunk.

311
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,630
That's correct.

312
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:58,530
Native VLAN is 1, same as Switch1.

313
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:02,570
And I didn't point this out on Switch1, but
all VLANs are allowed.

314
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,990
The allowed and active VLANs are 1, 10, and
12.

315
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,130
So same as Switch1.

316
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:16,230
So the trunk configuration here actually looks
fine, between the two switches.

317
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,090
Okay next, from PC3 do some more pings again.

318
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,299
Do all the pings succeed now?

319
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,919
Let's see.

320
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:29,420
So first the default gateway.

321
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,060
Okay, the ping works.

322
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:35,620
So looks like that VLAN issue was the main
problem.

323
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,510
How about PC1, in the same VLAN?

324
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,820
Yep, looks good.

325
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:47,880
How about PC2, in VLAN12?

326
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,110
Okay, it does not work.

327
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:59,180
How about PC4?

328
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:05,200
Okay, PC4 doesn't work either.

329
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,780
Okay, so there is definitely an issue there.

330
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,240
From PC2, attempt to ping every other device
in the topology.

331
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:20,200
Okay, PC2 is in VLAN12, connected to Switch1.

332
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,740
So let's open the CLI here.

333
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,470
First, ping its default gateway.

334
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:32,380
100.129.

335
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,840
Okay, PC2 cannot even reach its default gateway.

336
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,320
How about PC4 in the same VLAN?

337
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,780
Okay, this works.

338
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:46,220
So it can ping the other PC in the same VLAN,
but it cant ping its default gateway.

339
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,410
How about PCs in other VLANs?

340
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:55,080
It shouldn't be able to reach them because
it can't reach the default gateway.

341
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:01,440
Yep, as expected it doesn't work.

342
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,120
Okay, so clearly we still have an issue here.

343
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,789
So PC3 seems to be operating fine.

344
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:14,480
But PC2 can ping PC4 in the same VLAN, but
it can't ping its default gateway, which is

345
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,520
the subinterface here on Router1.

346
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,640
So clearly an issue still remains in the network.

347
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,710
So, I think we will solve those issues here
in task 3.

348
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,140
But I'll leave it here for today.

349
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:31,160
If you want to pick up a copy of NetSim for
yourself, please follow the link in the description.

350
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:38,580
I highly recommend it, it's great additional
practice for your CCNA and as you can see

351
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:47,690
there are plenty of labs from network fundamentals,
network access, IP connectivity, IP services,

352
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:48,690
security fundamentals.

353
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,740
This'll give you all the practice you need
to get ready for the exam.

354
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,409
So again, please follow the link in the description
and get a copy.

355
00:24:57,409 --> 00:24:58,980
