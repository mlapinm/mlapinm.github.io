lab we will configure OSPF version 3

until now the OSPF we have been

configuring is OSPF version 2 OSPF

version 3 however is used with ipv6 the

configuration is largely similar with

one major difference that actually makes

OSPF v3 simpler to configure let's get

started the first step is to create

loopback interfaces on each router these

will become the router ID for OSPF

although OSPF v3 is used with ipv6 the

router ID still comes in the form of an

ipv4 address that is a 32-bit number in

dotted decimal format

same with OSPF v to the router ID can be

manually configured if it's not manually

configured the highest ipv4 address on

the loopback interface will be used if

there is no loopback interface the

highest ipv4 address on a regular

interface will be used let's quickly

make these loop backs on our one first

enable compte interface l0 IP address

1.1 1.1 255 255 255 255 exit next are to

enable compte interface l0 IP address 2

2 2 2 255 255 255 255 exit next r3

enable coffee/tea interface l0 IP

address 3 3 3 3 255 255 255 255 exit

ok next are 4 enable coffee tea

interface l0 IP address 4.4.4 for 255

255 255 255 exit ok finally r5 enable

compte interface l0 IP address v dot v

dot v dot v 255.255.255.0 all for step 1

now let's enable OSPF v3 on each router

let's go back to our one to enter OSPF

v3 configuration mode just type ipv6 in

front of the regular OSPF command ipv6

router OSPF one however in OSPF v3 we

don't activate OSPF on each interface

from OSPF configuration mode we

configure it on each interface in

interface configuration mode so by using

the ipv6 router or SOS PF one command we

simply created the OSPF v3 process

number one

now let's activate OSPF v3 on G 0 0 and

G 0 1 interface G 0 0 we activate it

with this command ipv6 OSPF followed by

the process ID 1 then area then the area

number 1 that's it

interface G 0 1 IP v6 OSPF one area 1 ok

now let's go to our for also an area 1

now on our one we use the command ipv6

router OSPF one but we didn't actually

do any commands from that configuration

mode if we go directly to the interface

and enable OSPF v3 on it let's see what

happens interface g00 ipv6 OSPF one area

one do show run ok there it is on the

interface and there you can see that the

router created the OSPF v3 process

number one for us ok next let's

configure OSPF v3 on the remaining

routers make sure to put each interface

in the correct area our two next

interface g00 ipv6 OSPF one area one

interface g0 1 IP v6 OSPF one area zero

ok next is our 3 interface g 0 0 ipv6

OSPF one area 0 interface g 0 1 IP v6

OSPF one area - ok finally let's go on

our 5 interface g 0 0 ipv6 OSPF one area

- ok we have configured OSPF v3 on each

router let's wait a few seconds and then

check if r5 has received all the routes

it should be receiving

okay now before we check that let's use

a couple of show commands here on r5

typically I'd use commands like show IP

protocols show IP ospf for show IP ospf

neighbor

however for OSPF v3 we have to change

the IP in those commands to ipv6 show

ipv6 protocols as you can see this gives

us minimal information but it does show

which interfaces are when are in which

areas which is useful show ipv6 OSPF

this command gives us more details

including things like timers you can see

the router idea of v dot v dot v dot v

which was inherited from loopback zeros

ipv4 address show ipv6 OSPF neighbor

here you can see our 5s OSPF v3 neighbor

ship with r3

ok now let's check those reps do show

ipv6 repped looks like we have the OSPF

routes we need and the o i indicates

OSPF inter area routes since these

networks are all outside of our 5s area

- ok now we have one more task our one

is connected to the internet so let's

make a default route on r1 and then

advertise it into OSPF first let's

create the default route so we start

with ipv6 route and then to make a

default route type a double colon

followed by a slash 0 mask then let's

give it a next hop of 2001 DB 8 0 1 0 1

double colon - ok do show ipv6 route

okay there's the route now to advertise

the route into OSPF v3

first enter OSPF v3 configuration mode

ipv6 router OSPF one now the command to

advertise a default route into OSPF v3

is the same as in OSPF v2 for ipv4

however I didn't include this command in

the previous lab so I wanted to show it

in this lab that command is default

information originate that's it okay so

now let's go to one of the other routers

and see if the default route appears

I'll go check out our to do show ipv6

route there it is right at the top in

this lab we looked at OSPF v3 which is

used for ipv6 there isn't much

difference between it and OSPF v2 just

remember to configure it at the

interface level that's all for this lab
