lab we will troubleshoot the AI GRP

network we configured in the previous

lab I have made one miss configuration

per router so let's find the issues and

get AI GRP working in the network I'll

get started on our one enable let's see

if our one has any EIGRP neighbors show

IP e IG RP neighbors nothing however

this message is a big hint showing a

EIGRP neighbors for process 10 this

process number is the autonomous system

number this network is supposed to be

using an a s number of 100 so run here

we have all the correct ew g RP

configurations

however because r1 is using an incorrect

a s number of 10 none of it works

coffee tea let's delete the current ew g

RP configuration no router EA g RP 10 do

show run as you can see that removed all

of the EIG RP configurations for a s 10

now let's reconfigure it with the

correct a s number router EA g RP 100

network 10000 network 1.1 1.1

oh-oh-oh-oh passive interface l 0 no

auto summary well as you can see one

neighbor has come up r4

let's see what routes were getting from

our 4 do show IP route looks like we're

getting quite a few routes already

however if you look carefully although

our neighbor ship with r4 is up and

we're receiving reds from it we're not

getting our fours 4.4.4 for loopback

address

let's see what's wrong on our 4 enable

show IP protocols look here routing for

networks 10000 and 40 4.4.4 4/32

show IP interface brief our 4 is

loopback interface has an IP address of

4 4 4 4 not 40 4.4.4 4 so there's our

problem

coffee tea router EAG RP 100 no network

44.4 dot 4 dot 400 200 network for dot

4.4.4 oh oh oh oh ok that should fix it

I'll just quickly check on r1 do show IP

route there it is so we fix the issues

on r1 and r4 now r1 formed a neighbor

relationship with our 4 but what about

our to do show IP e IG RP neighbor only

our four appears let's check out our to

enable show IP protocols can you spot

the issue r2 is fast ethernet 1 0

interface which is used to connect to r1

is configured as a passive interface

this means r2 will advertise that 1012

0/24 network on f10 to r3 but it won't

form a neighbor relationship with r1 on

that interface compte router aig RP 100

no passive interface f10 there we go

immediately we get a message

do show IPE a GRP neighbor there are two

is a neighbor with both r1 and r3

let's see what's wrong on r3 enable show

IP protocols everything looks good

advertising the 3.3 3.3 loopback and

1000 dot o interfaces the loopback is

passive show IP e IG RP neighbor okay so

it's neighbors with r2 and r4 but not r5

show run I don't see any problems with

our 3zi GRP configuration so let's check

on our v enable show IP protocols can

you identify the problem here under the

routing for networks section it lists

1000 / 32 however r5 doesn't have any

1000 / 32 interfaces do show run as you

can see the / 32 wildcard mask was added

so yeah GRP isn't activated on our 5s

g00 interface which has an address in

the 10.35 0/24 network coughed e router

ya g RP 100 no network 1000 odo odo now

there are a couple of ways we could

activate di g RP on the interface let's

do what is configured on the other

routers and just type network 1000 and

leave it at that

remember Vig our P's Network command

will default to the class full

boundaries in this case a / 8 network

10.30 500 falls within the 1000 / 8

network so yeah GRP is now activated on

our 5

do show IP route now we're receiving a

EIGRP reps

however our five is supposed to receive

a 1000 / 8 summary from our 3 rather

than these individual reps this problem

is likely on our three let's go back do

show run the IP summary address command

isn't configured on the gig 0/0

interface which connects to our five but

rather the f10 interface let's put it

back on the correct interface let me

copy the command first then I'll remove

it interface f10 now I'll paste it here

and then I'll cancel it with no ok and

now let's put it on g00 interface g00

now I'll paste it here and there we go

let's check if r5 is receiving the

summary do show IP route there it is

10000 / 8 okay we have solved all the

issues in this network that's all for
