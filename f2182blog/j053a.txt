6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,250
Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,539
Also, remember to sign up via the link in
the description to get all of the lab files

8
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:27,270
for this course, so you can try it out yourself
in packet tracer.

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,500
If you want more labs like these, I highly
recommend picking up Boson’s NetSim for

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,350
the CCNA, click the link in the video description
to check it out.

11
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:40,140
It’s a network simulator like packet tracer,
but it’s even better, and it includes all

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,440
of these guided labs to not only help you
get hands-on practice configuring and troubleshooting,

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,390
but also deepen your understanding of the
exam topics.

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,790
I used it myself when studying for my certifications,
so I feel confident about recommending it

15
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,329
to all of you.

16
00:00:55,329 --> 00:01:00,770
If you want to get your own copy of NetSim,
please follow the link in the video description.

17
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:07,760
Also watch until the end of this video for
a bonus look at an OSPF lab in Boson NetSim.

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,070
In this lab we’ll do a bit of OSPF configuration
and troubleshooting.

19
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,500
Most of this network is pre-configured, except
for a few things.

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,730
However, there are a few misconfigurations.

21
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:23,880
So, let’s complete the configurations and
then troubleshoot the misconfigurations.

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,810
By the way, because there is troubleshooting
in this lab I highly recommend trying it out

23
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,830
yourself before watching this video.

24
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,880
If you see my solutions to the problems you
won’t have the opportunity to figure things

25
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,880
out yourself.

26
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,740
Okay, let’s get started.

27
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,150
First up in step 1, we have to configure this
serial connection between R1 and R2, and then

28
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,460
configure OSPF on both routers.

29
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:54,640
Note that R2 already has OSPF enabled on its
G0/0 interface, but not the serial interface.

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,500
I’ll configure R1 first.

31
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,400
ENABLE.

32
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,780
First I’ll check the interfaces.

33
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,420
SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.

34
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,640
Okay, so G0/0 is already configured, but S0/0/0
is not.

35
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,260
I’ll configure it now.

36
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,810
CONF T. INTERFACE S0/0/0.

37
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,629
First the IP address.

38
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:27,440
IP ADDRESS 192.168.12.1 255.255.255.252.

39
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,099
Now, the 
instructions say to set a clock rate of 128

40
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:32,159
kilobits.

41
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,450
We have to do that on the DCE side.

42
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,290
Let’s check if R1 is the DCE.

43
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,230
DO SHOW CONTROLLERS S0/0/0.

44
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:49,330
As you can see, R1 is the DCE, so let’s
set the clock rate.

45
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,870
CLOCK RATE 128000.

46
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,150
Finally I’ll enable the interface.

47
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,400
NO SHUTDOWN.

48
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,819
Okay, now I’ll configure R2’s end.

49
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:03,680
ENABLE.

50
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,690
SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.

51
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:13,250
Like R1, its G0/0 interface is already configured,
but not the serial interface.

52
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,500
CONF T. INTERFACE S0/0/0.

53
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:25,139
IP ADDRESS 192.168.12.2 255.255.255.252.

54
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:31,939
We already know this is the DTE end, since
R1 is the DCE end, but let’s check anyway.

55
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:36,950
DO SHOW CONTROLLERS S0/0/0.

56
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,909
Indeed it is the DTE end.

57
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:41,700
Okay, let’s enable the interface.

58
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,830
NO SHUTDOWN.

59
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,920
Now let’s enable OSPF on the interfaces.

60
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,260
First here on R2, let me see if OSPF is running.

61
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,340
DO SHOW IP PROTOCOLS.

62
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,400
Okay, OSPF is running, and it’s enabled
on the G0/0 interface.

63
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:06,219
Since I’m already on the S0/0/0 interface,
I’ll just enable OSPF directly here.

64
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:10,340
IP OSPF 1 AREA 0.

65
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,769
By the way, in a real network I’d recommend
being consistent about either enabling OSPF

66
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:20,910
directly on the interface, or using the NETWORK
command from OSPF config mode.

67
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,350
Now both configuration methods are mixed on
R2, but it’s not a big deal in a lab like

68
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,350
this.

69
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,750
Okay, now I’ll enable OSPF on R1.

70
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,310
First let’s check if OSPF is enabled.

71
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,720
DO SHOW IP PROTOCOLS.

72
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,180
Okay, it isn’t.

73
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,950
Again, I’m already on the interface so let’s
enable it here.

74
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,200
IP OSPF 1 AREA 0.

75
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,640
And I’ll do the same on G0/0.

76
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
INTERFACE G0/0.

77
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,570
IP OSPF 1 AREA 0.

78
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,310
Let’s check the interfaces.

79
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,700
DO SHOW IP OSPF INTERFACE S0/0/0.

80
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,060
Notice the network type of point-to-point
is enabled by default.

81
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:11,130
That’s because this is a serial interface,
using the HDLC encapsulation.

82
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:16,610
Also notice that there is no mention of DR
or BDR, because as you know the OSPF point-to-point

83
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,140
network type doesn’t use the concept of
DR and BDR.

84
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,520
The default Hello and Dead timers are 10 and
40 seconds, as expected.

85
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,030
Okay, let’s check G0/0.

86
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:33,530
DO SHOW IP OSPF INTERFACE G0/0.

87
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,510
Because this is an Ethernet interface, the
default network type is broadcast, and R1

88
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,240
is the DR.

89
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,220
Because there are no other routers connected
to this interface, there is no BDR.

90
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,760
Okay, finally let’s see if R1 is learning
OSPF routes.

91
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,690
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

92
00:05:50,690 --> 00:06:00,160
So, R1 has learned two routes from OSPF, to
the 192.168.34.0/30 network between R3 and

93
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,030
R4, and the 192.168.245.0/29 network between
R2, R4, and R5.

94
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,500
There are some missing routes, so let’s
move on to the troubleshooting section to

95
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,580
fix the network.

96
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:20,040
First up, in step 2 it says that only R3 has
a route to 10.0.2.0/24.

97
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,560
Well, as we just saw R1 indeed does not have
a route to the network.

98
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,280
What could prevent the other routers from
learning a route to 10.0.2.0/24?

99
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,910
For example, perhaps R3 and R4 aren’t successfully
forming an OSPF adjacency.

100
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,970
Let’s check, I’ll go on R4.

101
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,120
ENABLE.

102
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,430
SHOW IP OSPF NEIGHBOR.

103
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,430
As you can see here, R3 and R4 do have a full
OSPF adjacency.

104
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,000
Is R4 learning a route to 10.0.2.0/24?

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,340
SHOW IP ROUTE.

106
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,340
It isn’t.

107
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,680
So, think back to the lecture video.

108
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,800
What could cause R4 to fail to learn a route
from R3, even though they have a full OSPF

109
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,820
adjacency?

110
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,050
Let’s check the network type.

111
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,140
SHOW IP OSPF INTERFACE G0/1.

112
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:17,110
R4’s G0/1 interface is using the default
broadcast network type.

113
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,800
How about on R3?

114
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,350
ENABLE.

115
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,960
SHOW IP OSPF INTERFACE G0/1.

116
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,440
So, R3’s G0/1 is using the point-to-point
network type.

117
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,360
For a point-to-point connection between two
routers like this it’s no problem to use

118
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,200
the point-to-point network type, even though
it’s not the default on Ethernet interfaces.

119
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,920
However, when there is a mismatch like this
problems will occur.

120
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,020
I’ll remove the point-to-point configuration
here on R3.

121
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,240
CONF T. INTERFACE G0/1.

122
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,450
NO IP OSPF NETWORK POINT-TO-POINT.

123
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:02,240
Okay, let’s see if R4 has learned the route.

124
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,180
SHOW IP ROUTE.

125
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,750
There it is, 10.0.2.0/24.

126
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:14,840
To test if OSPF is working for this part of
the network, I’ll try a ping from PC1 to

127
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,310
PC2, it should work.

128
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:32,480
PING 10.0.2.1.

129
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:38,960
Okay, the ping works, so R1, R2, R3, and R4
seem to be operating fine.

130
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:44,420
Now let’s check step 3, which states that
R2 and R4 won’t become OSPF neighbors with

131
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,310
R5.

132
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:53,649
We just checked R4’s neighbor table and
R5 wasn’t there, so let’s check on R2.

133
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:56,240
DO SHOW IP OSPF NEIGHBOR.

134
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,970
Indeed, only R1 and R4 appear.

135
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:07,870
Let’s check some of the settings on the
interfaces in the 192.168.245.0/29 subnet.

136
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:15,019
Here on R2, DO SHOW IP OSPF INTERFACE G0/0.

137
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:21,750
The IP address is correctly in the subnet,
in area 0, and the timers are default.

138
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,830
Those are some basic settings that could cause
problems.

139
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,689
Next I’ll check R4 again.

140
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:33,160
SHOW IP OSPF INTERFACE G0/0.

141
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:39,660
R4’s interface is in the subnet, is in area
0 and the timers are default.

142
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:45,230
R2 and R4 seem fine, so perhaps the problem
is on R5.

143
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,630
Let’s check.

144
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,339
ENABLE.

145
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,390
SHOW IP OSPF INTERFACE G0/0.

146
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,000
The interface is in the correct subnet, in
area 0.

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,690
However, look at the timers.

148
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,319
Hello timer of 5 and Dead timer of 20.

149
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:09,740
These don’t match R2 and R4, so R5 won’t
become OSPF neighbors with them.

150
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,449
Let’s return R5’s timer to the default
settings.

151
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:18,300
CONF T. INTERFACE G0/0.

152
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,550
NO IP OSPF HELLO-INTERVAL.

153
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,810
NO IP OSPF DEAD-INTERVAL.

154
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:29,410
Okay, now I’ll click this arrow here to
skip the simulation forward 30 seconds, and

155
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,430
now let’s check R5’s neighbor table.

156
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,209
DO SHOW IP OSPF NEIGHBOR.

157
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:41,529
Okay, now R5 is OSPF neighbors with R2 and
R4.

158
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:46,950
The next problem is that PC1 and PC2 can’t
ping external server 8.8.8.8.

159
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:54,130
So, R5 is connected to the Internet and should
advertise a default route to the other routers.

160
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:58,769
But when checking the routing table of each
other router, I never saw a default route.

161
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:04,600
To confirm, I’ll try a ping from PC1.

162
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:12,600
PING 8.8.8.8.

163
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,870
The ping doesn’t work.

164
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,759
So, what’s the problem?

165
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,920
Let’s see if R5 is advertising its default
route.

166
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,170
I’ll go back on R5.

167
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:27,339
DO SHOW RUNNING-CONFIG | SECTION OSPF.

168
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:33,259
The DEFAULT-INFORMATION ORIGINATE command
is configured, so R5 should be sending a Type

169
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:37,370
5, AS-External LSA to the other routers.

170
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,740
But perhaps R5 doesn’t have a default route?

171
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,630
Let’s check.

172
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,420
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

173
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,129
Okay, there’s the problem.

174
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:48,319
There is no default route to advertise.

175
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:50,560
I’ll configure one.

176
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,939
EXIT.

177
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:58,850
IP ROUTE 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2.

178
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:05,490
Okay, now R5 should create that Type 5 LSA
and share it with the other routers, so PC1

179
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,350
and PC2 should be able to ping the external
server.

180
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:14,339
I’ll go check R1’s route table.

181
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,180
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

182
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,629
There it is, it learned the default route
from R5.

183
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:25,399
So, I’ll just try a ping from PC1.

184
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,120
PING 8.8.8.8.

185
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,279
Okay, PC1 can ping the external server.

186
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:39,290
Finally let’s check the LSDB.

187
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:43,470
Remember that all routers in the area will
have the same LSDB, so it doesn’t matter

188
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,019
which router you check on.

189
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:49,439
I’ll check on R1.

190
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:52,209
DO SHOW IP OSPF DATABASE.

191
00:12:52,209 --> 00:13:00,589
So, these router link states are Type 1, each
router advertises its own router LSA.

192
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:05,850
The Network link states are Type 2, the DR
of each multi-access network generates this

193
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,350
kind of LSA.

194
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:14,410
Finally there is one Type 5 AS External LSA,
sharing the default route from R5.

195
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:19,689
There are many more LSA types than this, but
for your CCNA just know these three types.

196
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:22,380
Okay, that’s all for this lab.

197
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,769
Now let’s move on to take a look at a lab
in Boson NetSim for CCNA.

198
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:31,980
Okay, here's today's Boson NetSim practice
lab, OSPF Routes.

199
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,420
So, this is a fairly short and simple lab.

200
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:40,119
As I've said in the past, there is quite a
variety of labs in Boson NetSim.

201
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,459
Some of them are larger, more complex, more
difficult.

202
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:45,920
And some of them are simpler, like this one.

203
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,170
So here is the objective.

204
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:52,290
Learn the commands needed to test an OSPF
configuration, pretty simple.

205
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,850
Here are the commands you need to know.

206
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,540
These are all commands you already know.

207
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,740
The IP addresses of each device.

208
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,410
And the lab tasks.

209
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:05,699
There are only six short steps in this lab,
so let's go through all of them.

210
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:12,119
Step 1, configure Router1 with the appropriate
host name, IP addresses, and also Router1

211
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:17,569
should be the DCE side of the serial connection
between Router1 and Router2.

212
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:19,269
So let's configure that.

213
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:23,559
I'm already in the CLI of Router1, as you
can see here.

214
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,199
ENABLE.

215
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,449
CONF T. HOSTNAME Router1.

216
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:33,089
Then the IP addresses, so let's check the
chart here.

217
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,819
First, FastEthernet0/0.

218
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:42,640
IP address ... 101.1 /24.

219
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,500
And I'll enable it.

220
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:54,749
Then the serial interface.

221
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:59,120
Now the lab instructions say that this is
the DCE side, but we should check just in

222
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,920
case.

223
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,559
DO SHOW CONTROLLERS S0/0.

224
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,679
And it says right here, DCE cable.

225
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,670
So this is the DCE side.

226
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:19,340
So let's set that clock rate of 64 kilobits
per second, which is 64 thousand bits.

227
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,291
Okay, and enable the interface.

228
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,360
Okay that's all for task 1.

229
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,499
Next, task 2 is to do the same on Router2.

230
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:33,999
So, to open the CLI of Router2, I click on
it here on the right and click on 'console'

231
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,290
to open a console connection.

232
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,550
ENABLE.

233
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,970
CONF T. HOSTNAME Router2.

234
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,680
And then the IP addresses.

235
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:51,620
First, FastEthernet0/0.

236
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,130
NO SHUT.

237
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,769
And then the serial interface.

238
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:58,029
I'll just check that this is DTE.

239
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:04,879
It should be, because Router1 was DCE, but
let's make sure.

240
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:07,999
Yes it is, DTE cable.

241
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:15,779
Okay, so let's configure the IP address.

242
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,879
And enable the interface.

243
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:23,440
Okay, let me just make sure that Router2 can
ping the other end, Router1.

244
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,130
Okay, no problem.

245
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,569
So that is task 2.

246
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:30,950
Next, task 3.

247
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,369
On Router1 display the routing table and review
the routes displayed.

248
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,589
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

249
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:46,320
Okay, it's got connected routes for its connected
networks, and no OSPF routes.

250
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,480
Okay, so that's task 3.

251
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,940
Task 4, configure Router1 and Router2 with
OSPF so that all devices can ping any other

252
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,360
device.

253
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,850
Use process ID 1 and area 0.

254
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:03,199
Okay, so first on Router1.

255
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,589
ROUTER OSPF 1.

256
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:11,870
I'll advertise the FastEthernet0/0 network...

257
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:20,740
101.0 /24 wildcard mask AREA 0.

258
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,920
And then the serial0/0 interface.

259
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:30,160
192.168.1.0 /24 AREA 0.

260
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:34,460
Okay, that's all for Router1.

261
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,580
Next up Router2.

262
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,090
Same deal.

263
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,960
ROUTER OSPF 1.

264
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,000
First, FastEthernet0/0...

265
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,809
100.1 /24 wildcard mask in area 0.

266
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:54,180
And then the serial0/0 interface.

267
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,360
AREA 0.

268
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,580
Okay, so Router1 and Router2 should become
OSPF neighbors.

269
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,309
Let's check the neighbor table here on Router2.

270
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:09,760
Okay, INIT state.

271
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,760
Still INIT.

272
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,700
I'm going to watch this process.

273
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,020
So we're in EXSTART now.

274
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,540
EXCHANGE.

275
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,800
Let's see if we can see the LOADING to FULL
transition.

276
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,179
Some of these transitions are pretty quick
so we might not see them.

277
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:31,289
Okay, it went pretty quickly from LOADING
to FULL, so we missed LOADING.

278
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:33,090
There it is, FULL state.

279
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:37,460
So, that is task 4.

280
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,289
Next, task 5.

281
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:40,289
Display the routing table.

282
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:44,299
It says on Router1, but I'll check here on
Router2 first.

283
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:45,890
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

284
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:51,630
Okay, it is learning the 192.168.101.0 network
here.

285
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,169
You can see it in the routing table.

286
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:55,690
Let's check on Router1.

287
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,190
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

288
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:07,010
Okay, and Router1 is learning Router2's network,
192.168.100.0 /24.

289
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,130
Okay, and then the final step.

290
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,549
Verify your configuration by pinging from
HostA to HostB.

291
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:14,549
Alright, let's do that.

292
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:18,740
I'll open up the CLI of HostA.

293
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,919
And let's do that ping.

294
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,760
PING 192.168.100.2.

295
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,700
Okay, we get a reply.

296
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:32,610
So, it says here, once you have completed
this lab, be sure to check your work by using

297
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,450
the grading function.

298
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,110
So that is up here, grade lab.

299
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:43,840
If you click it, it will tell us hopefully,
yes we completed the lab successfully.

300
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,830
So here are the configurations of each device.

301
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,800
If we were missing commands they would be
highlighted in red.

302
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,519
If we had any extra, unneeded commands they
would be highlighted in blue.

303
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:59,130
But we got everything right.

304
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:04,000
If you ever have any troubles during the lab
you can check Boson's lab solutions down here

305
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,519
which walk you through and give you explanations
of each step.

306
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:13,289
Okay, so that's all for this Boson NetSim
practice lab.

307
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:20,649
If you want to get a copy of Boson NetSim
for CCNA, follow the link in the video description.

308
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:26,240
Before finishing today’s video I want to
thank my JCNP-level channel members.

309
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,720
Recently I’ve noticed an increase in the
number of channel members, and I’m so thankful

310
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,490
to all of you, both JCNA and JCNP-level members.

311
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:39,460
Previously I read out the names of all the
JCNP-level members one by one, but the list

312
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,990
is getting longer so I’ll just leave the
list up here.

313
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:47,549
Your support helps me keep making and releasing
these videos every week, I’m really grateful

314

for your support.

315
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,600
This is the list of JCNP-level members at
the time of recording by the way, August 29th

316
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,951
2020, if you signed up recently and your name
isn’t on here don’t worry, you’ll be

317
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:03,649
