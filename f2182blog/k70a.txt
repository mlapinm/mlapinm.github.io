studying for the CCNA in this lab we

will troubleshoot HS RP the correct

configuration should be identical to the

previous lab however a couple of miss

configurations have been made I'll open

up r1 here and you can see it's

displaying the same error message over

and over again we are also told in the

instructions that are to doesn't retake

its role as the active router for VLAN

20 after recovering from a failure let's

take a look at this error message

duplicate address 10 10 10 1 that's the

virtual IP address used for VLAN 10 this

error message can often occur when there

are miss configurations between the two

routers that caused them not to

recognize each other as an active

standby pair so both routers claimed to

be the active router thus resulting in a

duplicate address in this case pcs in

VLAN 10 will still be able to use the

virtual IP address however whether they

go via r1 or r2 depends on which replies

to the ARP requests faster just to make

it easier to work I'll stop these

messages from being displayed enable

terminal no monitor if I didn't do that

the messages would keep appearing every

few seconds and make things difficult to

see

let's check the HSR P configuration show

standby and since the error message is

for VLAN 10 I'll just show G 0 1 the

interface for VLAN 10 hour 1 is claiming

to be the active which it should be in

our configuration

you can see the priority is 110 let's

check on our to enable terminal no

monitor show standby g 0 2 so R 2 is

also claiming to be the active router

what's causing this let's look at the

two side-by-side did you notice the

problem R 2 is using version 2 as a chit

however R 1 is not it's still using

version 1 let's fix that on our one

compte interface G 0 1 standby version 2

ok I'll wait here for 10 seconds or so

to let them work things out and then

let's check if r2 is the standby

okay hopefully that's enough time let's

check out our to show standby g02 there

we go

state is standby I'll try a traceroute

from pc1 to the external server just to

confirm it takes the path via r1 trace

route 1500 one perfect it's going via r1

at ten ten ten - so we solved the

problem here on r1 I'll enable the

syslog messages on r1 and r2 again since

those error messages should have stopped

on r1 first end terminal monitor okay

now let's do the same on r2 and terminal

monitor

okay now let's investigate what's up on

VLAN 20 show standby gig 0 1 so R 2 is

currently the active router for VLAN 20

but we're told in the lab instructions

that it doesn't retake its role as

active router when it recovers from a

failure actually I don't even need to

troubleshoot anything here if you come

across a problem like this the issue is

preemption actually it says right here

preemption disabled if preemption is

disabled the active router won't take

back its role as the active router if it

fails and then recovers it will become

the standby router the configuration

instructions say that preemption should

be enabled however so let's do that

coffee tea interface g0 1

standby 20 preempt do show standby G 0 1

there we go preemption enabled that's

all for this lab
