help.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,930
In this video we will return to Layer 3, after
spending quite a while in Layer 2 studying

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:32,029
VLANs, DTP, VTP, Spanning Tree, and EtherChannel. This
video will start a series of videos on dynamic

7
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:37,210
routing. ‘Dynamic routing’ is in contrast
to ‘static routing’, which we covered

8
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:43,829
in Day 11 of this course. Static routing involves
manually configuring routes to each destination

9
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,839
with the ‘IP ROUTE’ command. Dynamic routing,
on the other hand, involves configuring a

10
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:54,489
dynamic routing protocol on the router, and
then letting the router take care of finding

11
00:00:54,489 --> 00:01:01,480
the best routes to destination networks. It’s
called ‘dynamic routing’ because it’s not fixed.

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,400
If you add a new LAN, routers will automatically
inform each other about how to get to that

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,380
new destination network. If one path to a
destination becomes unavailable, the routers

14
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,560
will automatically start using the next-best
path. Over these next few videos we’re going

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:26,080
to cover a large portion of the exam topics
list. 3.0, IP Connectivity, accounts for 25%

16
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,049
of the CCNA exam, and we’re going to cover
almost all of it, just leaving out 3.5 for

17
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:37,200
later. We’ve already covered some of the
topics in here, for example we’ve covered

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,890
parts of 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3. My plan is to
review some parts we missed from here and

19
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:49,799
give a general overview of dynamic routing
protocols in today’s video, give an overview

20
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,560
of two routing protocols, RIP and EIGRP, in
Day 25, and then spend another two or three

21
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,539
days to cover OSPF, which is actually the
only dynamic routing protocol mentioned in

22
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:06,990
the exam topics list, in 3.4. However, even
though OSPF is the only one mentioned, you

23
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,150
still need a basic understanding of other
dynamic routing protocols, and need to be

24
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,900
able to compare and contrast them to OSPF.

25
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:20,909
Here’s what we’ll cover in today’s video.
First I’ll give a general overview of dynamic

26
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:25,489
routing protocols, to demonstrate how they
function and why they’re usually preferred

27
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:30,989
over static routes. There are a few types
of dynamic routing protocols, so I will break

28
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:37,580
them down. We will then take a brief look
at dynamic routing protocol metrics. A protocol’s

29
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,519
‘metric’ is how it measure how ‘far’
the destination is, like the root cost in

30
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,330
spanning tree protocol, and it’s used to
determine the best route to a destination.

31
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:52,269
Finally, we’ll talk about something called
‘administrative distance’, which is another

32
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:57,720
part of determining the best route to a destination.
Stick around to the end of today’s quiz

33
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,790
for a bonus question from Boson ExSim for
CCNA, the best practice exams for the CCNA,

34
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:09,470
and the ones I used when I studied for my
CCNA. If you want to get a copy of ExSim,

35
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,090
follow the link in the description.

36
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,159
Here is the network topology I’ll use for
the beginning of this demonstration. Four

37
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:27,920
routers, R1, R2, R3, and R4, and there is
a LAN connected to R4, 192.168.4.0/24. We’ll

38
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,209
be focusing mostly on R1’s perspective for
now. Without configuring any static routes

39
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,159
or dynamic routing protocol, R1’s routing
table looks like this, just connected and

40
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:44,450
local routes which were automatically added
when IP addresses were configured on its interfaces.

41
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,270
Let me take a minute to clarify a few points
on the exam topics list. These two routes

42
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:59,719
here, 10.0.12.0/30 and 10.0.13.0/30, are examples
of network routes. A network route is simply

43
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:07,610
a route to a network or subnet. In other words,
a route with a mask length less than /32.

44
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:14,420
For example, if we configure a static route
to 192.168.4.0/24, that’s a network route

45
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:21,640
also. It’s not a route to a single host,
but a route to a whole subnet. These two routes,

46
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:31,000
10.0.12.1/32 and 10.0.13.1/32, are examples
of host routes. A host route is a route to

47
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:38,150
a specific host, a single address, specified
with a /32 mask. These two routes here were

48
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:44,680
automatically added, and are host routes to the
specific addresses configured on R1’s G0/0

49
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:51,431
and G1/0 interfaces. To configure a static
route to a host, use IP ROUTE, followed by

50
00:04:51,431 --> 00:05:00,650
the host’s address, then 255.255.255.255,
which is a /32 mask. Okay, that was just an

51
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:06,900
aside, so you understand those two terms.
Now let’s talk about dynamic routing.

52
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,919
Instead of configuring static routes on each
of these routers, we can enable a dynamic

53
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:19,590
routing protocol on them. Then, R4 will ‘advertise’
this 192.168.4.0/24 network to its neighbor,

54
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:26,639
R2, saying ‘you can reach this network via
me. R2 will add that route to its route table.

55
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:34,100
It will then advertise the same thing to R1,
telling R1 that it can reach 192.168.4.0/24

56
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:40,820
via R2. R1 will add this route to its route
table. Actually, if you look above that route,

57
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:48,990
you can see that R2 also advertised the 10.0.24.0/30
network, between R2 and R4, to R1, and R1

58
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:55,241
added it to its route table. R1 will then
in turn advertise to R3, telling R3 that it

59
00:05:55,241 --> 00:06:04,390
can reach 192.168.4.0/24 via R1. It will also
advertise the 10.0.24.0/30 network that it

60
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:11,181
learned from R2, as well as the 10.0.12.0/30
network between R1 and R2, but we’re just

61
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:15,389
focusing on the one network for now.

62
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:20,949
How about if there is an error and R4’s
G0/0 interface goes down? The other routers

63
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:26,490
will automatically adapt and remove the route
from their route tables. As you can see, R1

64
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:33,169
has removed the route. This will prevent R1
from continuously sending traffic to a dead-end.

65
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:38,099
What if the same situation happened when using
static routing? I configured a static route

66
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:43,979
on R1. It can send traffic to R4’s network
with no problems. However, what if the same

67
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:49,620
failure on the link occurs? Because there
is no dynamic routing protocol in use, R1

68
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:55,569
is unaware that it can no longer reach the
192.168.4.0 network. If it receives packets

69
00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:00,790
destined for that network, it will continue
forwarding them to R2, unaware that R2 can

70
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:06,080
no longer reach the network. Okay, so that’s
a benefit of dynamic routing, the router will

71
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,979
remove invalid routes. However, we really
should make sure there is a backup route,

72
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:16,140
so instead of totally removing the destination
network from the route table, it is replaced

73
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,160
with the next-best route.

74
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:25,830
So, I’ve added another connection between
R3 and R4. Now R1 has two valid paths to R4’s

75
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:33,390
internal network. via R2, and via R3. Let’s
check R1’s route table. You can see it still

76
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:40,070
has the route via R2 in its route table, as
it says via 10.0.12.2. In this case, what

77
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:45,240
will happen if I disable R4’s G0/0 interface
to simulate a failure?

78
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,180
So, I did that, and now let’s check R1’s
route table. As you can see, the route via

79
00:07:52,180 --> 00:08:00,260
R2 was now automatically replaced with the
route via R3, it says via 10.0.13.2. So, we

80
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:07,360
lost the preferred route to 192.168.4.0, but
traffic can still follow this path. Now, you

81
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,560
may be wondering, why the route via R2 was
preferred over the route via R3? That’s

82
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,940
because this connection here is a fastethernet
connection, not gigabit ethernet. You’re

83
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,940
already familiar with the spanning-tree concept
of ‘root cost’, which is used to determine

84
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:28,370
the best path to the root bridge. Well, dynamic
routing protocols use a similar concept to

85
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:35,700
determine the best path to a destination.
R1 learned about the 192.168.4.0/24 network

86
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:42,280
from both R2 and R3, however it determined
that the path via R2 is superior because it

87
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,860
‘costs’ less.

88
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:49,200
Okay, so that’s a very quick introduction
to dynamic routing protocols, and their basic

89
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,720
purpose. Here are a few key points. Routers
can use dynamic routing protocols to advertise

90
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,860
information about their connected routes as
well as routes they have learned from other

91
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:06,580
devices. They form ‘adjacencies’ , also
know as ‘neighbor relationships’ or ‘neighborships’

92
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:12,510
with adjacent routers to exchange this information.
For example, in this network R1 will form

93
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:18,780
adjacencies with R2 and R3, its directly
connected neighbors. If multiple routes to

94
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,330
a destination are learned, the router determines
which route is superior and adds it to the

95
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:28,400
routing table. It uses the ‘metric’ of
the route to decide which is superior, and

96
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,850
the lower metric is superior. Just like in
spanning tree, the lower root cost is superior

97
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:40,450
when determining the root port on a switch.
I’ll talk more about metric later.

98
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:45,530
Now lets talk about the different types of
dynamic routing protocols. Dynamic routing

99
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:52,450
protocols can be divided into two main categories,
IGP, which stands for Interior Gateway Protocol,

100
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:59,230
and EGP, which stands for Exterior Gateway
Protocol. Let’s define those. IGPs are used

101
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:04,840
to share routes within a single autonomous
system, AS, which is a single organization,

102
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:12,380
for example a company. EGPs are used to share
routes between different autonomous systems.

103
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:19,000
Maybe this diagram will make it easier to
understand. Company A, Company B, ISP A, and

104
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,640
ISP B are each their own autonomous system,
AS. Within each organization, an IGP is used

105
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,400
to exchange routing information. However,
to exchange routing information between AS’s,

106
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:39,080
an EGP is used. The basic purpose of IGPs
and EGPs is the same, to share information

107
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:44,600
about routes to destinations. However they
function differently. Because this is a CCNA

108
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,620
course, we will focus mostly on OSPF, which
is an IGP, however you will also learn about

109
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,630
other IGPs and the one EGP that is in use
today, to the extent that you need to know

110
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,510
them for the exam.

111
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:03,180
Now let’s break down these categories further.
As I mentioned, the two big categories are

112
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:10,760
Interior Gateway Protocols, IGPs, and Exterior
Gateway Protocols, EGPs. However, you can

113
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,960
further break these categories down by the
‘algorithm type’. This refers to the processes

114
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:22,630
used by each protocol to share route information
and determine the best route to each destination.

115
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:28,280
There is only one type of EGP algorithm, Path
Vector. Not only is there only one type of

116
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:34,990
EGP algorithm, but there is only one EGP that
is used in modern networks. That is BGP, the

117
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:40,650
Border Gateway Protocol. Because it’s not
necessary for the CCNA, I won’t talk much

118
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,520
about BGP. I will mention a few important
things later, but beyond that you don’t

119
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:51,101
need to know BGP for the CCNA. Just make sure
you’re aware of the purpose of an EGP, to

120
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:56,860
share route information between autonomous
systems, and know that BGP is the only EGP

121
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:02,200
that is used in modern networks. So, you also
don’t need to know the details of how a

122
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:08,760
‘Path Vector’ algorithm functions. Now,
IGPs have two algorithm types, distance vector

123
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,610
and link state. I’ll repeat, when I say
‘algorithm’ I mean the processes each

124
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:19,630
protocol uses to share route information and
choose the best route to each destination.

125
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,610
All routing protocols have the same goal.
That is what I just said, to share route information

126
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:30,290
and select the best route to each destination.
However, the algorithm used to do so is different

127
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:37,350
for each routing protocol. There are two distance
vector protocols, RIP, the Routing Information

128
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:43,820
Protocol, and EIGRP, Enhanced Interior Gateway
Routing Protocol. I won’t cover these two

129
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,390
protocols in depth, although I will give you
a basic outline of their function so you can

130
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:56,600
compare and contrast them with OSPF. So, RIP
and EIGRP are the two distance vector protocols.

131
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:04,190
There are also two link state protocols. OSPF,
Open Shortest Path First, and IS-IS, Intermediate

132
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:11,190
System to Intermediate System. Like BGP, I
won’t talk about IS-IS much. If you want

133
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:16,790
to learn more about IS-IS, consider looking
into the CCNP Service Provider path after

134
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:24,120
the CCNA. OSPF, however, I will spend plenty
of time talking about over the next few videos.

135
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,670
For now, what I want you to remember is, first
of all, the names of each of these routing

136
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:35,671
protocols. Then remember which protocols use
which kind of algorithm. RIP and EIGRP use

137
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:42,540
a distance vector algorithm, OSPF and IS-IS
use a link state algorithm, and BGP uses a

138
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:48,760
path vector algorithm. The flashcards I provide
will be very helpful for this. Okay, now I

139
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,560
want to outline the characteristics of distance
vector and link state protocols.

140
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,640
I’ll start with distance vector routing
protocols. Once again, the distance vector

141
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:04,800
protocols we will learn about are RIP and
EIGRP. Distance vector protocols were invented

142
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,460
before link state protocols, in the early
1980s. Early examples of distance vector protocols

143
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:20,330
are RIP and Cisco’s proprietary protocol
IGRP, which was later updated to become EIGRP.

144
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,040
Distance vector protocols operate by sending
the following information to their directly

145
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,370
connected neighbors. their known destination
networks, and their metric to reach their

146
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,540
known destination networks. This method of
sharing route information is often called

147
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:39,790
‘routing by rumor’. Why the name? It’s
because the router doesn’t know about the

148
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:45,510
network beyond its neighbors. It only knows
the information that its neighbors tell it.

149
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:49,180
This is different than link state routing
protocols, in which the router develops a

150
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:54,290
more complete picture of the network. When
using a distance vector protocol, on the other

151
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,721
hand, all the router knows is the routes its
neighbors tells it about, and their metric

152
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:04,440
to reach those destinations. The reason for
the name ‘distance vector’ is because

153
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,720
the routers only learn the ‘distance’,
which is the metric, and the ‘vector’,

154
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,720
which is the direction to send the traffic, the
next-hop router, of each route. Basically,

155
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,950
distance vector protocols work by sharing
their route table, or parts of it, with their

156
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,320
neighbors.

157
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:27,920
So, the example I showed you before of R4
advertising its 192.168.4.0 network is an

158
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:34,050
example of distance vector logic. R4 tells
R2, its directly connected neighbor, ‘You

159
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:41,380
can reach 192.168.4.0/24 via me. My metric
to reach it is 1.’ Don’t worry about the

160
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,770
metric numbers yet, each routing protocol
uses a different type of metric and we will

161
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:52,050
cover those soon. Anyway, R2 doesn’t know
anything except that it can reach 192.168.4.0/24

162
00:15:52,050 --> 00:16:01,500
via R4, and that R4’s metric is 1. Similarly,
R2 then tells R1 the same, except it advertises

163
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,221
the metric as 2. Once again, R1 doesn’t
have a detailed picture of the network, all

164
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:13,900
it knows is that it can reach 192.168.4.0/24
via R2, and that R2’s metric to reach it

165
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:20,880
is 2. And of course, R1 advertises the network
to R3, with its own metric to reach the destination

166
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,530
network. Once again, RIP and EIGRP are the
two distance vector routing protocols that

167
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:31,410
are used, and we will talk more about them
in day 25’s video.

168
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:36,770
Next I’ll briefly introduce link state routing
protocols. When using a link state routing

169
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:42,100
protocol, every router creates a ‘connectivity
map’ of the network. This map will be the

170
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:48,670
same on each router. To allow this, each router
advertises information about its interfaces,

171
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:53,570
its connected networks, to its neighbors.
These advertisements are passed along to other

172
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:58,760
routers, until all routers in the network
develop the same map of the network. Then,

173
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,450
each router independently uses this map to
calculate the best routes to each destination.

174
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:07,540
I think you can see how this is different
than the ‘routing by rumor’ of distance

175
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:13,220
vector protocols. In link state protocols,
each router gets a whole picture of the network

176
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:19,120
so that it can calculate the best routes.
Link state protocols use more resources, more

177
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,351
CPU power and memory, on the router, because
more information is shared. However, link

178
00:17:24,351 --> 00:17:28,640
state protocols tend to be faster in reacting
to changes in the network than distance vector

179
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:36,250
protocols. The two link state protocols in
use today are OSPF and IS-IS. I will briefly

180
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:43,160
mention some things about IS-IS, but as for
OSPF, we will go very in depth.

181
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,300
Now let’s talk about those metrics that
I mentioned a few times. A router’s route

182
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:52,860
table contains the best route to each destination
network it knows about. If a router using

183
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:58,040
a dynamic routing protocol learns two different
routes to the same destination, how does it

184
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:03,890
determine which is ‘best’? As I briefly
mentioned before, It uses the metric value

185
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:09,480
of the routes to determine which is best.
A lower metric is considered better. It’s

186
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:15,150
like the root cost in spanning tree. A lower
root cost is considered superior, so the interface

187
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:21,340
with the lowest root cost will become the
root port. For dynamic routing protocols,

188
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,531
the route with the lowest metric is considered
best and will be entered in to the routing

189
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:32,920
table. Each routing protocol uses a different
metric to determine which route is the best.

190
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:40,571
Here in this slide I showed you before, although
R1 learns two paths to 192.168.4.0/24, one

191
00:18:40,571 --> 00:18:48,230
via R2 and one via R3, only the route via
R2 is added to the routing table. This fastethernet

192
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:53,360
connection here has a higher metric cost than
the other gigabit ethernet connections, so

193
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,150
this route is less favorable. Now, you might
be wondering: What if this was also a gigabit

194
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:04,010
ethernet connection? Both routes would have
the same cost, so which route would be added

195
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,030
to the route table? Let’s see what happens.

196
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:12,131
I changed the connection between R3 and R4
to be a gigabit ethernet connection like the

197
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:19,800
others. Let’s check out R1’s route table.
So, BOTH routes have been added to the table.

198
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:28,880
via 10.0.13.2, which is R3, and via 10.0.12.2,
which is R2. So, if a router learns two (or

199
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,860
more) routes via the same routing protocol
to the same destination, with the same metric,

200
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:40,631
both will be added to the routing table. Traffic
will be load-balanced over both routes. Note

201
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:46,570
that they must be exactly the same destination,
the same network address and same prefix length.

202
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:52,110
Here’s a larger view. In this case both
routes were learned by the dynamic routing

203
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:58,510
protocol OSPF, as indicated by the code O
next to the routes. They are both to the exact

204
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:06,610
same destination, 192.168.4.0/24, and they
both have the same metric. The metric value

205
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:12,390
itself is also displayed in this output. Where
is it? It’s here, the second value in these

206
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:17,821
square brackets is the metric value of the
route. Both routes have a metric of 3, so

207
00:20:17,821 --> 00:20:24,310
both were added, and traffic will be load-balanced
over both routes. This is called Equal Cost

208
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:31,140
MultiPath, or ECMP, load-balancing. Make sure
you remember this term, ECMP, it will come

209
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:37,250
up often in these videos about dynamic routing
protocols. As for these values on the left

210
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:42,150
side of the square brackets, this is another
important value called ‘administrative distance’,

211
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:48,950
or AD, which I will talk about a few slides
later. The OSPF protocol has an AD of 110.

212
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:55,100
Don’t memorize that now, as I said I’ll
talk about that again in a few slides.

213
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:01,070
Since I just showed you ECMP, equal cost multipath
load-balancing with a dynamic routing protocol,

214
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,850
I just want to let you know that you can do
the same with static routes as well. I disabled

215
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:13,590
OSPF on R1, and then configured two static
routes to 192.168.4.0, one via R2 and one

216
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:19,490
via R3. Then, both are added to the routing
table, and traffic will be load-balanced over

217
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:25,280
both routes. Notice that both routes have
a metric of 0. Static routes don’t really

218
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:31,820
use the concept of ‘metric’ so you’ll
always see 0 here. Notice also that the administrative

219
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:37,651
distance, AD, value of static routes is 1.
As I said, I’ll talk about what AD is in

220
00:21:37,651 --> 00:21:42,390
a few slides. For now, let’s return back
to the topic of metric.

221
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:47,590
As I already mentioned, each routing protocol
uses a different metric. I will go into each

222
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:53,560
of these in more detail in later videos, but
here is a summary to introduce you to each.

223
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:59,540
RIP uses by far the simplest metric, hop count.
Each router in the path to the destination

224
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:05,960
counts as one ‘hop’, and the total metric
is the total number of hops to reach the destination.

225
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:11,620
One big downside is that links of all speeds
are equal, they all count as one hop. A 10

226
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:17,360
megabit per second ethernet link is one hop,
and a 10 gigabit per second link is one hop.

227
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:24,890
So, this is a very primitive way of calculating
metric, and is clearly not ideal. EIGRP uses

228
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:29,830
the most complicated metric of the IGPs, which
is a calculation based on bandwidth and delay

229
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:36,370
by default, however with configuration other
factors can be calculated as well. One thing

230
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,700
to note is that only the bandwidth of the
SLOWEST link in the route is used to calculate

231
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:46,670
the metric, but the total delay values of
all links in the path are used. This ‘delay’

232
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:51,440
value is a little misleading, since by default
it’s a value assigned to the interface based

233
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,010
on its bandwidth. Anyway, I’ll talk more
about this in the next video when we go in

234
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:03,760
more depth on EIGRP. Next up is OSPF, its
metric is called ‘cost’. The cost of each

235
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,990
link is calculated based on the bandwidth,
and the total bandwidth of the links in the

236
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:13,220
route make up the metric of the route. This
is a very simple way of calculating metric,

237
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:18,940
but also clearly better than RIP’s which
doesn’t take into account link speed. Finally,

238
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:25,160
IS-IS also uses a metric called ‘cost’.
However, the cost of each link is not automatically

239
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:32,540
calculated based on bandwidth. All links have
a cost of 10 by default. So, without any configuration,

240
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:38,650
it functions the same as RIP, being a simple
hop count metric. Okay, so IS-IS I won’t

241
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,991
talk about much, but these other three I will
give more detail about in future videos. For

242
00:23:42,991 --> 00:23:49,780
now just remember the basics. RIP uses hop
count, EIGRP uses a calculation based on bandwidth

243
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:56,420
and delay, and OSPF uses a cost based on bandwidth.
The purpose of all of these metrics is the

244
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:01,860
same, to let the router select the best route
to the destination.

245
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,450
To briefly demonstrate how the difference
in metrics can affect which routes the router

246
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:11,610
selects, let’s look at this diagram again
from R1’s perspective, deciding which route

247
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:20,100
to 192.168.4.0/24 to select for its route
table. If it uses RIP, the metric is hop count.

248
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:28,160
Via R2, the hop count is 2. One hop to R2,
one hop to R4. Via R3, the hop count is also

249
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:35,030
2. One hop to R3, one hop to R4, even though
the connection from R3 to R4 is a slower,

250
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:41,070
fastethernet connection. So, both routes will
be put into R1’s route table, and R1 will

251
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:46,980
load balance traffic using both routes, even
though one route is slower. However, if OSPF

252
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:53,390
is used instead of RIP, which path will be
used? Unlike RIP, OSPF’s metric cost does

253
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:59,160
take into account bandwidth. So, the slower
connection between R3 and R4 will result in

254
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:05,200
a higher metric value, making it less favorable.
So, only this route will be entered into the

255
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,660
route table, and R1 will send all traffic
destined to the 192.168.4.0/24 network via

256
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:18,740
R2. RIP views both routes as equal, but OSPF
does not. Again, the purpose of all of these

257
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:23,550
metrics is the same, to let the router select
the best route to the destination, but some

258
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:28,480
routing protocols might make better decisions
than others.

259
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,290
Now let’s talk about administrative distance,
which I briefly mentioned earlier. In most

260
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:38,890
cases a company will only use a single IGP
for their network – usually OSPF, but sometimes

261
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:45,810
EIGRP if they only use Cisco equipment. However,
in some rare cases they might use two. For

262
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:50,040
example, if two companies connect their networks
to share information, two different routing

263
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:55,230
protocols might be in use. You might connect
a network running OSPF to a network running

264
00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:01,450
EIGRP. Metric, which I just showed you, is
used to compare routes learned via the same

265
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:07,350
routing protocol. If a router learns two routes
to the same destination via OSPF, it uses

266
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:12,920
metric to choose which route is better. However,
different routing protocols use totally different

267
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:20,800
metrics, so they cannot be compared. For example,
an OSPF route to 192.168.4.0/24 might have

268
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:28,760
a metric of 30, while an EIGRP route to the
same destination might have a metric of 33280.

269
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,309
Which route is better? Which route should
the router put in the route table? We can’t

270
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:38,550
really answer those questions by looking at
the metrics, because OSPF and EIGRP use totally

271
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:44,880
different metrics. So, the administrative
distance, or AD, is used to determine which

272
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,400
routing protocol is preferred. A lower AD
is preferred, and indicates that the routing

273
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,650
protocol is considered more ‘trustworthy’,
meaning more likely to select good routes.

274
00:26:55,650 --> 00:27:00,270
As you saw before, RIP’s hop count-based
metric system is not very good, so it has

275
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:05,550
a high AD, because it’s not as trustworthy.
It might say two routes are equal because

276
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:12,420
they have the same hop count, although really
one route is much worse because of lower bandwidth.

277
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:17,200
Ready for some memorization? These are the
administrative distances of most common types

278
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,990
of routes. I HIGHLY recommend you use the
flashcards to remember these. I would be surprised

279
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:29,001
if you don’t get a question on the exam
like ‘Two routes to the 10.0.0.0/24 network

280
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:35,270
are learned, one from OSPF and one from EIGRP.
Which route will be entered in the route table?’.

281
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:41,940
To answer that question, you would need to
know that EIGRP has a lower AD, so the EIGRP

282
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:47,050
route is preferred and will be entered in
the route table. Again, a lower AD number

283
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:52,070
is preferred, and will be selected over a
higher AD. Keep in mind that these are the

284
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:58,390
values used on Cisco devices, other vendors
might rank these differently. So, the most

285
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:04,860
preferred routes are those to directly connected
networks, they have an AD of 0. Static routes

286
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:12,260
are the next best, they have an AD of 1. Next
up are external BGP, also known as eBGP routes,

287
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:20,060
with an AD of 20. There is another kind of
BGP, internal BGP, iBGP, which you’ll see

288
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:27,700
later. EIGRP routes have an AD of 90. Next
is IGRP, the older version of EIGRP, with

289
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:38,760
an AD of 100. OSPF has an AD of 110. IS-IS
has an AD of 115, and RIP has an AD of 120.

290
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:46,690
So, of the IGPs I showed you, which are RIP,
EIGRP, OSPF, and IS-IS, EIGRP is the most

291
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:55,020
preferred, it has the lowest AD. However,
EIGRP external routes have a higher AD, 170.

292
00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:00,260
These are beyond the scope of the CCNA, but
basically they are routes from outside of

293
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:08,280
the EIGRP network, that are then advertised
into EIGRP. Then internal BGP, iBGP, has an

294
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:15,929
AD of 200. Then one more. Routes with an AD
of 255 are unusable. Here’s a quote from

295
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:22,190
Cisco. If the administrative distance is 255,
the router does not believe the source of

296
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:27,570
that route and does not install the route
in the routing table. So, make sure you memorize

297
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,020
these. If you’re not using the flashcards,
I really think you should for things like

298
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:37,730
this. Without flashcards it might be difficult
to memorize these. But if you use the flashcards,

299
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,580
it’s quite easy.

300
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:45,330
Here’s a quick quiz question to demonstrate
a point. The following routes to the destination

301
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:53,970
network 10.1.1.0/24 are learned. A route with
a next hop of 192.168.1.1, learned via RIP,

302
00:29:53,970 --> 00:30:00,750
with a metric of 5. A route with a next hop
of 192.168.2.1, learned via RIP, with a metric

303
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:09,820
of 3. And a route with a next hop of 192.168.3.1,
learned via OSPF, with a metric of 10. Which

304
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:16,110
route to 10.1.1.0/24 will be added to the
route table? Pause the video to think about

305
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:26,090
the answer. Okay, so the answer is the OSPF
route will be added to the route table. Metric

306
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:31,340
is used to compare routes learned from the
same routing protocol. However, before comparing

307
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:37,420
metrics, AD is used to select the best route.
The OSPF route will always take precedence

308
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:42,610
over the RIP routes, because it has a lower
AD.

309
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:47,200
Looking back at the route table I showed you
before, here you can see the AD of 1 for these

310
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,480
static routes. The connected and local routes
above them have an AD of 0, but it is not

311
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,590
displayed in the route table.

312
00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:02,040
And another look at this route table with
OSPF routes. Here you can see the AD of 110.

313
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,340
Remember that the number on the left inside
the square brackets is the AD, and the number

314
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,870
on the right is the metric.

315
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:15,260
One final point before moving on to the quiz.
You can change the AD of a routing protocol,

316
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:20,250
and I will demonstrate this when we cover
OSPF configuration in a later video. If you

317
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:25,450
want OSPF routes to be preferred over EIGRP
routes, you can configure the router to do

318
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:31,980
that. You can also change the AD of a static
route. Notice here I used the standard command

319
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:38,490
to configure a static route. IP ROUTE, followed
by the destination, the subnet mask, and then

320
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:44,460
the next hop address. However, I used the
question mark to check for further options.

321
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:49,370
Here it says ‘distance metric’ for this
route. It includes the word ‘metric’,

322
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:53,600
but don’t confuse this for the metric we
talked about earlier. This is administrative

323
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,600
distance.

324
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:01,470
So, I configured the route with an AD of 100.
In the output of ‘show ip route’, you

325
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:07,590
can see that the AD is now 100, instead of
the default 1 for a normal static route. Now,

326
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,510
why would you want to do this?

327
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:15,110
By changing the AD of a static route, you
can make it less preferred than routes learned

328
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:20,080
by a dynamic routing protocol to the same
destination. But, you have to make sure that

329
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,800
the static route’s AD is higher than the
routing protocol’s AD, or else the static

330
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:30,080
route will still be preferred. This kind of
static route is called a ‘floating static

331
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,020
route’. The route will be inactive, meaning
it won’t be in the routing table, unless

332
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:40,300
the route learned by the dynamic routing protocol
is removed. For example, maybe the remote

333
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:45,140
router stops advertising it for some reason,
or an interface failure causes an adjacency

334
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:49,911
with a neighbor to be lost. You can see here
that floating static routes are part of the

335
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:55,200
exam topics list. Make sure to watch the lab
videos and download my packet tracer labs

336
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,799
to get practice configuring everything we
cover.

337
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:03,970
Okay, so let’s quickly review what we covered
in today’s video. I gave you a brief introduction

338
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:08,870
to dynamic routing protocols. They allow routers
to automatically learn routes to different

339
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:15,010
destinations without having to manually configure
static routes. Static routes are useful, but

340
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:19,160
in large networks it’s not practical to
use only static routes, you would have to

341
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:24,610
configure thousands of different routes, which
is not a good strategy. We covered the different

342
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:30,081
types of dynamic routing protocols. First,
the big two categories are IGPs, interior

343
00:33:30,081 --> 00:33:36,630
gateway protocols, used for routing within
an organization. Then there are EGPs, exterior

344
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:43,090
gateway protocols, used for routing between
organizations, for example over the Internet.

345
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:48,860
The only EGP in use these days is BGP. We
can also categorize routing protocols by the

346
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:55,490
kind of algorithm they use. There is one type
of EGP algorithm, that is path vector. However

347
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:02,600
there are two different kinds of IGP algorithms.
Distance vector, used by RIP and EIGRP. Also

348
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:09,929
link state, used by OSPF and IS-IS. Then we
talked about metrics. Each routing protocol

349
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:15,250
uses a different metric, which is a value
used to determine the best route to a destination,

350
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:21,000
within the same routing protocol. However,
how do you compare different routing protocols?

351
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,590
With administrative distance. Use the flashcards
to remember the AD of each kind of route and

352
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:31,730
routing protocol, I’m sure you’ll need
it for the test. I introduced a lot of topics

353
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:36,320
in this video, so I want to say that you shouldn’t
be worried if you feel you don’t understand

354
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,720
completely yet. In the next video I will cover
RIP and EIGRP, and then the next two or three

355
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,360
videos after that will cover OSPF. In those
videos we will review all of these fundamental

356
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:52,240
topics again, such as administrative distance
and metric.

357
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:58,000
Okay let’s move on to today’s quiz. At
the end of the quiz there will be a bonus

358
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,660
question from Boson ExSim, the best practice
exams for the CCNA. If you’re preparing

359
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:09,260
for the CCNA exam and you want to make sure
you’re really ready, Boson ExSim is, in

360
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:13,619
my opinion, the single best thing you can
get to prepare yourself for the real exam.

361
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:17,000
Follow the link in the description to get
Boson ExSIm.

362
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:25,130
Here’s quiz question 1. R1 learns four routes
to 192.168.1.0/24 through multiple routing

363
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:33,560
protocols: RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, and IS-IS. Which
route/routes will be added to the route table?

364
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:42,990
A, the RIP route only. B, the EIGRP route
only. C, the OSPF route only. D, the IS-IS

365
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:51,660
route only. E, the RIP and EIGRP routes, because
both are distance vector protocols. F, OSPF

366
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:57,950
and IS-IS, because both are link state protocols.
Or G, all routes will be added to the routing

367
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:05,800
table. Pause the video to think about your
answer.

368
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:14,000
The answer is B, only the EIGRP route will be added to the routing table. Why is
this? When selecting which route to a certain

369
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:19,480
destination to add to the routing table, and
routes are learned from multiple routing protocols,

370
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,810
the AD is used to determine which will be
added to the routing table. EIGRP has the

371
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:30,890
lowest AD of the four protocols, so only the
EIGRP route will be added to the routing table.

372
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:34,810
Let’s go to question 2.

373
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:40,420
Which type of routing protocol is also known
as ‘routing by rumor’? A, link state.

374
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:53,220
B, path vector. C, distance vector. Or D,
interior gateway. Pause the video to think about your answer.

375
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,920
The answer is C, distance
vector. Distance vector protocols such as

376
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,470
RIP and EIGRP operate by telling neighboring
routers which routes they know, and their

377
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:08,850
metrics to reach those networks, this is known
as ‘routing by rumor’. A is incorrect

378
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:14,710
because, when using a link state protocol
such as IS-IS or OSPF, each router develops

379
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:18,910
a complete map of the network to calculate
the best routes, which is different than the

380
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:24,140
minimal information a router receives from
neighbors when using a distance vector protocol.

381
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:30,170
B, path vector, is a type of EGP, exterior
gateway protocol. It’s not covered in the

382
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:37,150
current CCNA, and operates differently than
distance vector. D, interior gateway protocols,

383
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:42,670
or IGP, is a category which includes both
distance vector AND link state protocols,

384
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:46,970
so it is incorrect. Let’s go to question
3.

385
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:59,060
R1 learns two routes to 172.16.0.0/16 via
RIP, one via 10.0.0.1 and the other via 10.1.0.1.

386
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:05,860
Both routes are 5 hops away. Which route/routes
will be entered into the routing table? A,

387
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:16,130
both routes. B, only the route via 10.0.0.1.
C, only the route via 10.1.0.1. Or D, neither

388
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:26,780
route will be added because RIP’s AD value
is too high. Pause the video to think about your answer.

389
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:31,610
The answer is A, both routes
will be added to the route table. Both routes

390
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:39,360
are to the same destination, 172.16.0.0/16.
They were learned through the same protocol,

391
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,900
RIP. And they have the same metric, 5. So,
because of these conditions, both will be

392
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:51,400
added to the routing table and R1 will load-balance
traffic over the two routes. As for option

393
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:59,810
D, if R1 also learned a route to 172.16.0.0/16
via another routing protocol such as OSPF,

394
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:05,640
this would be true, because RIP’s AD value
is higher than OSPF, so it is less preferred.

395
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:12,060
However, there was no mention of another routing
protocol, so D is incorrect. Okay, now let’s

396
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:16,410
take a look at a bonus question from Boson
ExSim for CCNA.

397
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:21,800
Okay, for today's Boson ExSim practice question
I got another question that I really like,

398
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,900
it's a good question about route selection.
Let's get right into it. You issue the SHOW

399
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:31,840
IP ROUTE command on RouterA and receive the
following partial output. So, we are shown

400
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:42,530
four routes, S R D O. S is a static route,
R is learned via RIP, D is learned via EIGRP.

401
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:49,430
That's right, its D, not E. And O is OSPF.
So, they are to four different destinations.

402
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:54,590
All of them begin '10.20.0.0', but they have
different prefix lengths, so these all count

403
00:39:54,590 --> 00:40:02,090
as different destinations. The static route
is /22, /24, /26, /28. So these are not the

404
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:09,080
same destination. So that's why, even though
the static route has the lowest AD, it's the

405
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:14,240
most preferred, all of the routes appear in
the routing table. Not just the static route.

406
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:21,430
So, RouterA receives a packet that is destined
for 10.20.0.14. Which of the following routes

407
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:28,000
will RouterA use to send the packet? Select
the best answer. So, A, the RIP route because

408
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,110
it has the highest administrative distance.
B, the OSPF route because it is the route

409
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:38,310
with the longest prefix match. C, the static
route because static routes are preferred

410
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:45,080
over dynamic routes. Or D, the EIGRP route
because it has the lowest administrative distance.

411
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:55,890
Okay, pause the video here to think about
your answer. Okay, so let's check the answer.

412
00:40:55,890 --> 00:41:03,609
So, in today's video I just talked about metric
and administrative distance. So, if you receive

413
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:09,320
routes from multiple routing protocols to
the same destination, you use the administrative

414
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:15,480
distance to select the route. But if you get
multiple routes from the same routing protocol,

415
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,680
you use the metric. However, these routes
are not to the same destination. These are

416
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:26,430
different destinations, as I just said, because
the prefix lengths are different. So, these

417
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:32,780
AD and metric numbers are irrelevant. So,
what did I tell you in, I believe it was Day

418
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:38,630
11's video about static routes? How does the
router decide which route to use? If this

419
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:43,869
destination matches multiple entries in the
routing table. And this destination does match

420
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:48,170
all of these entries, so it could use any
route. Which one does it use? It uses the

421
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:54,720
most specific match. And 'most specific' means
the longest prefix. So that is /28, so it

422
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:05,120
should use this OSPF route and send the packet
to 192.168.10.1 out of its Serial0/1 interface.

423
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:10,670
So, I think B, 'the OSPF route because it
is the route with the longest prefix match',

424
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:17,610
is the correct answer. Let's check. And it
is. So, if you didn't quite understand my

425
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:21,450
explanation, here is Boson's explanation.
You can pause the video here to read it. This

426
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:27,040
is the great thing about Boson ExSim, is it
gives you in-detail explanations. Not just

427
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,900
why B is correct, but also why A, C, and D
are incorrect. And after that there is a reference

428
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:38,420
to some Cisco documentation, which is freely
available on the Internet, 'Route selection

429
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:44,020
in Cisco routers'. Okay, so that was today's
Boson ExSim practice question. If you want

430
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:48,270
to get a copy of ExSim, please follow the
link in the video description. These are the

431
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:53,349
exams I used when I studied for my CCNA and
CCNP exams and I really think they helped

432
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:57,620
me pass all of my exams on the first try.
So once again, if you want to get a copy of

433
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:03,600
ExSim, please follow the link in the video
description.

434
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:08,170
There are supplementary materials for this
video. There is a flashcard deck to use with

435
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:12,810
the software ‘Anki’. There will also be
a packet tracer practice lab so you can get

436
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:18,560
some hands-on practice. That will be in the
next video. Sign up for my mailing list via

437
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,400
the link in the description, and I’ll send
you all of the flashcards and packet tracer

438
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,850
lab files for the course.

439
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:30,651
