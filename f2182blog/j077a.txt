the video to help spread this free series of&nbsp;&nbsp;

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,000
videos. Thanks for your help. Also, remember&nbsp;
to sign up via the link in the description to&nbsp;&nbsp;

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,400
get all of the lab files for this course, so&nbsp;
you can try it out yourself in packet tracer.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,280
If you want more labs like these, I highly&nbsp;
recommend picking up Boson’s NetSim for the CCNA,&nbsp;&nbsp;

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,600
click the link in the video description to&nbsp;
check it out. It’s a network simulator like&nbsp;&nbsp;

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,200
packet tracer, but it’s even better,&nbsp;
and it includes all of these guided&nbsp;&nbsp;

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,280
labs to not only help you get hands-on&nbsp;
practice configuring and troubleshooting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,560
but also deepen your understanding of the exam&nbsp;
topics. I used it myself when studying for my&nbsp;&nbsp;

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,240
certifications, so I feel confident&nbsp;
about recommending it to all of you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,840
If you want to get your own copy of NetSim,&nbsp;
please follow the link in the video description.

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,760
In this lab we’ll configure SNMP, Simple Network&nbsp;
Management Protocol. As I write at the top of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,440
lab instructions, SNMP functionality is very&nbsp;
limited in packet tracer, so unfortunately&nbsp;&nbsp;

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,560
all we can do is enter a couple commands and&nbsp;
then check out a few things on PC1, the NMS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,560
I was hoping to clarify some more things about&nbsp;
SNMP configuration since I only briefly skimmed&nbsp;&nbsp;

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,280
over it in the lecture video, but we won’t be&nbsp;
able to do that. But that’s okay, you don’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

18
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,400
actually need to know about SNMP configuration&nbsp;
for the CCNA exam so don’t worry about it.

19
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,840
Okay let’s do step 1 and configure&nbsp;
read-only and read/write communities on R1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,880
ENABLE. CONF T. SNMP-SERVER, and&nbsp;
I’ll use the question mark here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,080
COMMUNITY, that’s the only&nbsp;
available command. No HOST command,&nbsp;&nbsp;

22
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,840
so we can’t even specify a server to send traps&nbsp;
to. All we can do is configure communities here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

23
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,680
and then try a few things out on the NMS. So,&nbsp;
let’s configure those communities. COMMUNITY&nbsp;&nbsp;

24
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:12,000
Cisco1 RO, that’s the read-only string. And&nbsp;
then COMMUNITY Cisco2 RW, the read/write string.

25
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,720
Okay, that’s all we can do. Now I’ll go on PC1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

26
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,560
Click on Desktop, then MIB Browser. This&nbsp;
let’s us view the different variables,&nbsp;&nbsp;

27
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:35,280
the OIDs, in the MIB of R1. So, up here enter&nbsp;
R1’s IP address, 192.168.1.254. However that’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

28
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,320
not all. Click on advanced, and then enter&nbsp;
those two communities we just configured.&nbsp;&nbsp;

29
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:49,840
Cisco1 for the Read community, and Cisco2 for&nbsp;
the Write community. I’ll leave it at SNMPv1, I’m&nbsp;&nbsp;

30
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:57,200
not sure if other versions would work in Packet&nbsp;
Tracer. Okay, now let’s explore some OIDs. First,&nbsp;&nbsp;

31
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,800
how long has R1 been running, what’s the system&nbsp;
uptime? Open the MIB Tree here, router_std MIBs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

32
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:16,480
iso, org, dod, internet, mgmt, mib-2, system,&nbsp;
and then here we can select ‘sysUpTime’. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

33
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,480
look at the top right. Notice the Get operation&nbsp;
is already selected, so I’ll just click on GO.&nbsp;&nbsp;

34
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,920
And here, you can see the OID,&nbsp;
and the value for that OID,&nbsp;&nbsp;

35
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,320
this is the current uptime of R1, how long it&nbsp;
has been turned on. Let’s check another one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

36
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,120
the sysName variable will tell us R1’s&nbsp;
hostname, which as you already know is R1.

37
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,600
Okay let’s check out some information about R1’s&nbsp;
interfaces. From ‘interfaces’, select ‘ifNumber’,&nbsp;&nbsp;

38
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:58,320
and then send the Get. The value is 4, so R1 has&nbsp;
4 interfaces. Now I’ll expand ‘ifTable’ here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

39
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:05,680
and ‘ifEntry’. Let’s click on ‘ifDescr’, and&nbsp;
send a Get. Now you can see a description of&nbsp;&nbsp;

40
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,120
each interface. It has a Vlan1 interface,&nbsp;
and three gigabit ethernet interfaces, 0/0,&nbsp;&nbsp;

41
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:20,480
0/1, and 0/2. How about the ‘ifType’ OID? Send&nbsp;
a Get, and you can see the interface type. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

42
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,480
these gigabitethernet interfaces are copper,&nbsp;
not fiber-optic, interfaces. How about,&nbsp;&nbsp;

43
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:33,520
‘ifAdminStatus’? Send a Get, and you can see&nbsp;
that only this interface, which is G0/0, is up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

44
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,520
because it is enabled and connected to SW1. So,&nbsp;
there are some other things we could check but&nbsp;&nbsp;

45
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,440
I’ll leave it there. Now in step 3 let’s&nbsp;
use a Set message to change a value on R1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

46
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,640
I’ll do a Get once more for the system name.&nbsp;
Next, change the operation type to Set.&nbsp;&nbsp;

47
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,760
First, we have to select the data type,&nbsp;
what kind of data is the host name?&nbsp;&nbsp;

48
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,280
It is displayed here, ‘OctetString’.&nbsp;
So, select OctetString here. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

49
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:12,000
enter a new value. You can change it to whatever&nbsp;
you like, I’ll just change it to R11. Hit OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

50
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,920
then click GO to send the Set. As you can see, the&nbsp;
value has been changed to R11. Now if I return to&nbsp;&nbsp;

51
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:26,720
the CLI of the router, and hit enter, you can see&nbsp;
the hostname has changed to R11. Let’s check the&nbsp;&nbsp;

52
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:35,200
running config. DO SHOW RUN | INCLUDE HOST.&nbsp;
So, it has been changed in the config, also.

53
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,280
Okay, so that was a brief look at SNMP in Packet&nbsp;
Tracer. There’s not much you can do with SNMP in&nbsp;&nbsp;

54
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,520
packet tracer, but that’s okay since you don’t&nbsp;
actually need to know the configurations for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

55
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,480
CCNA exam. Next let’s take a look at a practice&nbsp;
lab in Boson Software’s NetSim for CCNA.

56
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,520
Okay here's today's Boson NetSim practice lab.&nbsp;
As I've said before, SNMP configuration is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

57
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,920
on the CCNA exam topics list. So there isn't an&nbsp;
SNMP configuration lab in Boson NetSim for CCNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

58
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,760
There are plenty of labs for the IP services&nbsp;
section of the exam, but not for SNMP because&nbsp;&nbsp;

59
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:21,760
it's not on the exam topics list. So, for&nbsp;
today's demonstration I will take a lab from&nbsp;&nbsp;

60
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:31,840
NetSim for ENCOR 350-401. This is the core exam of&nbsp;
the CCNP Enterprise certification. And they have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

61
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,680
practice lab down here in the security&nbsp;
section, configuring network device management.&nbsp;&nbsp;

62
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,440
And that is this lab here. So&nbsp;
this lab involves configuring&nbsp;&nbsp;

63
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,840
VLANs, which you know, SNMP which you&nbsp;
know a little bite, and then TACACS,&nbsp;&nbsp;

64
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,400
which is AAA. That is something I will talk&nbsp;
about in the security section of my course.&nbsp;&nbsp;

65
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:04,160
Okay, so these are the SNMP commands you need to&nbsp;
know. SNMP-SERVER CONTACT, COMMUNITY, HOST, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

66
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,760
LOCATION. So these are commands I already covered.&nbsp;
So you should be able to do this lab, even though&nbsp;&nbsp;

67
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:15,840
you're not at the CCNP level yet. Or at least&nbsp;
do the SNMP portion, not the TACACS portion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

68
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,760
Okay, so let's get on it. I already did task 1&nbsp;
beforehand, which is configuring the management&nbsp;&nbsp;

69
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:27,440
VLAN, because I want to get straight to task 2,&nbsp;
which is configure and verify SNMP on Router1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

70
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,920
And you can see what I did in task 1. So, I&nbsp;
added another subinterface here on Router1&nbsp;&nbsp;

71
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:43,840
with an IP address. Created VLAN99 on these&nbsp;
two switches and gave them IP addresses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

72
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:52,960
Okay, so let's configure and verify SNMP on&nbsp;
Router1. Okay, configure SNMP version 2 for&nbsp;&nbsp;

73
00:07:52,960 --> 00:08:00,640
read-only access using the community string&nbsp;
Boson. Okay, so the command for all of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

74
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:09,520
is SNMP-SERVER, or it begins like that. And the&nbsp;
community is Boson. And it should be read-only.&nbsp;&nbsp;

75
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,720
Now, we don't specify version 2 yet, we specify&nbsp;
that in the SNMP-SERVER HOST command I believe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

76
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,520
So that should be correct. Okay then the contact&nbsp;
address, SNMP-SERVER CONACT snmp@boson.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;

77
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,160
Okay then the location,&nbsp;
SNMP-SERVER LOCATION R1_SNMP.&nbsp;&nbsp;

78
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,520
And then I have to configure&nbsp;
PC1 to be the trap receiver,&nbsp;&nbsp;

79
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:50,880
so that means the NMS, network management station.&nbsp;
And to use a community string of snmp_logs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

80
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:58,400
Okay, we haven't configured that community&nbsp;
string yet, but alright let's see.&nbsp;&nbsp;

81
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:13,040
SNMP-SERVER HOST 10.10.0.2. We're&nbsp;
supposed to use version 2, so...okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

82
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,120
looks like they do not suport that&nbsp;
command. snmp_logs is the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;

83
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:28,000
And that's it. Yeah, okay. So on Router1 verify&nbsp;
that SNMP is enabled for the correct community&nbsp;&nbsp;

84
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,880
string. So let's use some other show commands&nbsp;
here. SHOW SNMP, and look we can view all of those&nbsp;&nbsp;

85
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:43,120
things we just configured. SNMP COMMUNITY. There&nbsp;
it is, community name boson and it is read-only.&nbsp;&nbsp;

86
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,920
And this looks like it is a default&nbsp;
string, I did not configure that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

87
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:57,120
Let me see if that's in the configuration. INCLUDE&nbsp;
COMMUNITY. No it is not in the configuration,&nbsp;&nbsp;

88
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:06,240
so this looks like a default community string.&nbsp;
Okay, the location. SHOW SNMP LOCATION.&nbsp;&nbsp;

89
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:17,840
Okay, that is correct. SHOW SNMP&nbsp;
CONTACT. snmp@boson.com, okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

90
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:26,880
Verify that SNMP is enabled for the trap receiver&nbsp;
with the correct community string. SHOW SNMP HOST.&nbsp;&nbsp;

91
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,600
Okay, there it is, 10.10.0.2, PC1.&nbsp;
Notice UDP port 162, that is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

92
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:45,280
port that the NMS uses to receive SNMP messages.&nbsp;
Traps are enabled by default. User, this is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

93
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:51,040
community. And it says security model version 1,&nbsp;
so this might not be working exactly as intended.&nbsp;&nbsp;

94
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,400
Let me check. So I have not finished this lab&nbsp;
of course, there's still a lot to configure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

95
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,840
But I will use the grade lab function to see if I&nbsp;
configured this SNMP portion correctly. Grade lab.&nbsp;&nbsp;

96
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:11,760
Okay and let's check out Router1's configuration.&nbsp;
Okay, so this is the, this is part of the AAA&nbsp;&nbsp;

97
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:20,640
configuration. TACACS, that's also&nbsp;
AAA. And here this login authentication&nbsp;&nbsp;

98
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,480
aaa_authentication. But looks like&nbsp;
the SNMP configuration is correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;

99
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Here it is. Okay, so that is this short&nbsp;
SNMP practice lab. And we can also check&nbsp;&nbsp;

100
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,040
out Boson's lab solutions down here.&nbsp;
They have good explanations. Let me&nbsp;&nbsp;

101
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,560
see...here. Configure and verify SNMP on&nbsp;
Router1. So basically it just shows the&nbsp;&nbsp;

102
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,840
commands you have to use with some&nbsp;
sample output of the show commands.&nbsp;&nbsp;

103
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,000
Okay, so that's a quick look at SNMP, simple&nbsp;
network management protocol, configuration&nbsp;&nbsp;

104
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,120
in Boson NetSim. Once again, this is&nbsp;
not part of the CCNA exam topics list.&nbsp;&nbsp;

105
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,200
So you don't really have to worry about&nbsp;
remembering these SNMP commands yet. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

106
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,920
once you do go on to your CCNP studies, if you do,&nbsp;
you'll definitely need to know them. Okay, so if&nbsp;&nbsp;
