welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab you can download the lab

file from the link in the description if

you like these labs please consider

supporting me via my patreon or the

cryptocurrency options in the

description this lab will be similar to

the previous lab in which we use telnet

to connect to a switch and router in

this lab however we will use the more

secure option SSH which stands for

secure shell ssh is more secure because

it encrypts packets between the devices

so that even if the packets are

intercepted by an attacker they can't be

read there are a few extra steps

involved in configuring SSH but it's not

so complicated the four requirements are

first you must use the hostname command

to configure the hostname of the device

to reinforce this I haven't

pre-configured the host names of the

devices for this lab second you must

configure the DNS domain name using the

IP domain name command third you must

generate the SSH key to be used to

encrypt the packets and fourth SSH must

be enabled on the vqi lines we will go

through these steps and a couple others

in this lab try to complete the lab

yourself first then continue watching

this video if you have trouble or watch

it after to check your solution if you

haven't learned the commands necessary

to complete the tasks yet in your

studies feel free to watch this video to

learn them

step one is to configure the host names

of switch 1 and r1 this is a requirement

for SSH so let's do that now on switch 1

first enable comte hostname switch 1 now

on r1 enable compte hostname r1 there we

go step 2 is to configure that IP

addresses indicated this is the same as

in the previous lab I'll start on our 1

first since we're already here interface

g00 IP address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0

no shutdown because the interface is

disabled by default now let's configure

a switch ones VLAN 1 interface interface

VLAN 1 IP address 192.168.1.1 4 5.0 no

shutdown that's all for step 2 step 3 is

to configure a single user account on

each device which we will use to login

to the device when we SSH from pc1 on

switch 1 first exit username Cisco

password CCNA I've said it many times

before but remember passwords are case

sensitive now on our one exit username

cisco password CCNA that's all for step

3 step 4 is to configure a dns domain

name on each device this is an another

required step for configuring SSH and we

will use a domain name of cisco.com for

this lab this only requires one command

here on our 1 first IP domain name

cisco.com

that's it now on switch one IP domain

name Cisco calm that's all for step four

Step five is to generate the keys used

to encrypt the packets this is done with

this command crypto key generate RSA now

we are asked for the modulus size the

length of the keys used for the

encryption and decryption process

we're instructed to use 1024 there we go

now let's do the same on our one crypto

key generate RSA 1024 that's all for

step 5

step six is now to configure the vty

lines there are a few requirements and

let's configure them one by one on our

one first line vty 0 15 again meaning

line 0 through 15 login local that's the

same command used last time meaning we

will have to use the user account we

created previously to log into the vty

lines when we connect transport input

last time we use telnet now we'll enter

SSH

this will allow only SSH not telnet to

be used to connect to the vty lines the

third requirement for this lab is to

terminate connections after five minutes

of inactivity this is an important

security measure it is done with this

command exact timeout now I'll use the

question mark any time you have to input

some amount of time check the unit of

time used for the commands you don't

want to enter 5 for 5 minutes if it ends

up being 5 seconds in this case we can

see it is entered in minutes so I'll

just enter 5 always remember that for

commands involving time now I'll quickly

hop on switch 1 and enter the same

commands line vty 0 15 login local

transport input ssh exec timeout 5

that's all for step 6

step seven is to enable SSH version 2

version 2 improves on weaknesses of

version 1 if you want to learn more

about this sort of thing I recommend

pursuing Cisco's security certification

path where you will learn all about this

sort of thing for now just remember that

you should use SSH version 2 whenever

possible you can enable it with this

command exit IP SSH version 2 that's it

now we'll do it on our one exit IP SSH

version 2 that's it

finally let's see if we can connect to

the command line of each device from pc1

by using SSH first let's see if telnet

works

I'll try to tell net to switch one

telnet 192.168.1.2 as you can see it

doesn't work this is because of that

transport input SSH command we used

before now let's try SSH that is done

with this command SSH - L Cisco Cisco

being the username we are connecting

with which we configured on switch 1 and

R 1 followed by the IP address

192.168.1.1 tur the password of CCNA in

all caps and there we go we're on switch

1 now I'll type exit and try r1 SSH - L

Cisco 192.168.1.1 password of CCNA and

now we're on our one take note of the

difference between the command used to

tell net and the command used to SSH

onto the switches and routers these are

the standard commands used on windows

anyway that's all for this lab
