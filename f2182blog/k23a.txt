welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer
practice lab 4.441302 you can download the lab
file from the link in the description 8.104074 if
you like these labs please consider
supporting me via my patreon or the
cryptocurrency options in the
description 15.675164 this lab will be similar to
the previous lab in which we use telnet
to connect to a switch and router 23.075096 in
this lab however we will use the more
secure option SSH 28.612822 which stands for
secure shell 30.163418 ssh is more secure because
it encrypts packets between the devices
36.386534 so that even if the packets are
intercepted by an attacker 39.764439 they can't be
read 41.295479 there are a few extra steps
involved in configuring SSH 46.394102 but it's not
so complicated 47.994835 the four requirements are
first you must use the hostname command
to configure the hostname of the device
56.005866 to reinforce this I haven't
pre-configured the host names of the
devices for this lab 61.302971 second you must
configure the DNS domain name using the
IP domain name command 68.618413 third you must
generate the SSH key to be used to
encrypt the packets 74.281381 and fourth SSH must
be enabled on the vti lines 78.639071 we will go
through these steps and a couple others
in this lab 82.963312 try to complete the lab
yourself first 85.533388 then continue watching
this video if you have trouble or watch
it after to check your solution 90.999633 if you
haven't learned the commands necessary
to complete the tasks yet in your
studies 95.915768 feel free to watch this video to
learn them
98.534667 step one is to configure the host names
of switch 1 and r1 104.746805 this is a requirement
for SSH 107.723137 so let's do that now 109.163438 on switch 1
first 111.544977 enable conf t hostname switch 1 118.657285 now
on r1 enable conf t hostname r1 126.500177 there we
go 128.742280 step 2 is to configure that IP
addresses indicated 132.743981 this is the same as
in the previous lab 135.022253 I'll start on our 1
first since we're already here 138.588561 interface
g00 IP address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
148.089224 no shutdown because the interface is
disabled by default 151.809330 now let's configure
a switch ones VLAN 1 interface 156.700461 interface
VLAN 1 IP address 192.168.1.2 4 255.255.255.0 no
shutdown 170.083868 that's all for step 2 172.361119 step 3 is
to configure a single user account on
each device 179.394619 which we will use to login
to the device when we SSH from pc1 184.023534 on
switch 1 first exit username Cisco
password CCNA 191.085652 I've said it many times
before but remember passwords are case
sensitive 197.032271 now on r1 exit username
cisco password CCNA 205.571587 that's all for step
3 207.979048 step 4 is to configure a dns domain
name on each device 214.415336 this is an another
required step for configuring SSH 218.927526 and we
will use a domain name of cisco.com for
this lab 223.433688 this only requires one command
226.972464 here on r1 first 228.893685 IP domain name
cisco.com
233.483987 that's it 235.299358 now on switch 1 236.949232 IP domain
name Cisco com 242.516940 that's all for step four
244.682831 Step five is to generate the keys used
to encrypt the packets 251.153486 this is done with
this command 253.464683 crypto key generate RSA 258.412043 now
we are asked for the modulus size the
length of the keys used for the
encryption and decryption process
265.057786 we're instructed to use 1024 268.949657 there we go
270.606586 now let's do the same on r 1 273.744951 crypto
key generate RSA 1024 280.920911 that's all for
step 5
282.502767 step six is now to configure the vty
lines 289.890528 there are a few requirements and
let's configure them one by one 293.351254 on our
one first line vty 0 15 299.151696 again meaning
line 0 through 15 login local 304.405024 that's the
same command used last time meaning we
will have to use the user account we
created previously to log into the vty
lines when we connect 312.556345 transport input
last time we use telnet now we'll enter
SSH
318.689429 this will allow only SSH not telnet to
be used to connect to the vty lines 324.870002 the
third requirement for this lab is to
terminate connections after five minutes
of inactivity 331.415334 this is an important
security measure 334.028971 it is done with this
command 336.392802 exact timeout now I'll use the
question mark 340.683516 any time you have to input
some amount of time 344.480616 check the unit of
time used for the commands 347.272614 you don't
want to enter 5 for 5 minutes if it ends
up being 5 seconds 352.190214 in this case we can
see it is entered in minutes so I'll
just enter 5 357.693095 always remember that for
commands involving time 361.803121 now I'll quickly
hop on switch 1 and enter the same
commands 367.150300 line vty 0 15 login local
transport input ssh exec timeout 5
381.010363 that's all for step 6
382.959121 step seven is to enable SSH version 2
389.594967 version 2 improves on weaknesses of
version 1 392.804064 if you want to learn more
about this sort of thing I recommend
pursuing Cisco's security certification
path 398.464446 where you will learn all about this
sort of thing 401.634984 for now just remember that
you should use SSH version 2 whenever
possible 406.571666 you can enable it with this
command 409.758915 exit IP SSH version 2 that's it
415.322600 now we'll do it on r 1 418.088832 exit IP SSH
version 2 that's it
426.321447 finally let's see if we can connect to
the command line of each device from pc1
by using SSH 434.154856 first let's see if telnet
works
439.610212 I'll try to tell net to switch one
442.144376 telnet 192.168.1.2 as you can see it
doesn't work 451.170359 this is because of that
transport input SSH command we used
before 455.250715 now let's try SSH 458.953644 that is done
with this command 460.723278 SSH - L Cisco Cisco
being the username we are connecting
with which we configured on switch 1 and
R 1 470.570994 followed by the IP address
192.168.1.2 the password of CCNA in
all caps and there we go 481.394587 we're on switch
1 482.655763 now I'll type exit and try r1 485.975417 SSH - L
Cisco 192.168.1.1 password of CCNA 496.152611 and
now we're on our one 498.529575 take note of the
difference between the command used to
tell net and the command used to SSH
onto the switches and routers 506.222144 these are
the standard commands used on windows
509.253113 anyway that's all for this lab
