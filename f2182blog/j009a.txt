Thanks for your help. Let’s get started.
23.890
In this lab we’ll finally get hands on in the Cisco IOS CLI, the command line interface.
31.250
If you’ve already watched the Day 4 lecture video, you should be able to complete these
35.500
tasks on your own.
37.300
Even if you can, I recommend watching this video after to check and get any additional explanations.
43.630
So, we’ve got a small network here with a few PCs, and switch, and a router.
50.400
Our tasks involve some basic configurations on the router and switch.
54.020
For this video, I will only configure the router.
57.310
However, I recommend that you go through the steps on both devices.
61.730
Repetition is essential to get used to all of the commands you need to know, so remember
65.469
to configure both devices!
68.829
Step 1 is to set the appropriate hostnames for each device, R1 and SW1.
73.459
We didn’t cover the command in the main video, but to do so you use the ‘hostname’
79.849
command in global configuration mode.
82.920
Click on the device, and then select CLI to access the command line interface from which
88.159
we will configure each device.
90.320
Now, in the lecture video I explained about how to connect to the console port of a device.
96.029
In packet tracer, you can actually do that, connect a PC to the console port of the device,
101.490
and then use the PC to do the configurations.
104.880
However, simply clicking on the device itself is much more convenient, so that’s what
109.850
we’ll be doing for these labs.
112.279
Just keep in mind that in real life, you can’t configure the device directly on the device
115.920
itself, you have to connect to it with a computer.
120.979
The current hostname for each device is displayed here.
124.909
As you can see, by default the hostname is router.
128.789
To change the hostname, we must enter 'Global configuration' mode.
133.240
However to get there, we must first enter 'Privileged exec' mode.
137.120
This is achieved by using the 'enable' command.
140.780
To demonstrate a shortcut, I will use the 'exit' command to return to the previous exec mode.
147.329
Notice that you can enter privileged exec mode by simply typing 'en'.
151.780
You can also type 'en' and then use tab to auto-complete it to 'enable', but this isn't necessary.
157.670
'en' alone is fine.
160.260
'e', however, is too short, and we are told this is an ambiguous command.
166.810
This is because there are other potential commands that begin with 'e', which we can
170.709
see by tying 'e' and then a question mark.
174.420
As you can see, there are two potential commands; enable, and exit.
178.330
So, if you just enter 'e', the router doesn't know which command you mean.
183.030
However, 'enable' is the only command beginning with 'en', so 'en' is all the router needs
189.079
to know which command you mean.
192.109
Now that we are in privileged exec mode, we can use the 'configure terminal' command to
196.739
get to 'global configuration' mode.
199.880
If you want to use shortcuts again as we did with enable and 'en', the shortest version
204.379
of the 'configure terminal' command is 'conf t'.
209.110
From here we can set the hostname of the router.
212.020
This is done with the hostname command.
214.969
I will enter 'hostname R1'.
218.719
As you can see, the hostname has changed from 'router' to 'R1'.
223.379
Change the hostname of SW1 as well, and that’s all for step 1.
229.370
Step 2 is to set the unencrypted enable password on each router to CCNA.
235.639
The 'enable password' is used to enter privileged exec mode, which is also called enable mode.
242.349
Previously we had no password set, so we were able to enter privileged exec mode without any password.
249.180
Now we are going to protect privileged exec mode so that only administrators can access it.
255.700
The command is simple, and it is done in 'global configuration' mode, which we are already in.
261.530
Type 'enable password CCNA'. That's it.
266.280
Now let's test it out, which is step 3.
269.600
From here I will use the exit command twice, once to bring me back to privileged exec mode
274.590
and then once again to bring me back to user exec mode.
278.450
Now I will use the enable command again, however this time I am asked for a password.
284.590
The characters do not appear as I type, however if I type the password 'CCNA' correctly and
290.349
press enter I am brought to privileged exec mode.
293.880
Now let's see what happens if I fail to enter the correct password.
297.500
I enter the wrong password once, twice, and then three times before being rejected for having 'bad secrets'.
307.020
Now I will try again with the correct password, and I'm in.
310.850
Step 3 is now complete.
313.990
Step 4 is simply to view the password in the running configuration.
318.590
The running configuration is the current active configuration of the router, whether or not you have actually saved it.
325.200
If you turn off the router without saving the running configuration you will lose any changes.
330.550
If you want to keep your changes you have to save them to the startup configuration.
335.670
To view the running configuration, use the show running-config command from privileged
340.479
exec mode, which we are already in.
343.400
You can abbreviate it too, for example sh run.
348.740
Enter the command, and you can see the password right here, with the exact command we used
353.050
before, 'enable password CCNA'.
357.300
As you can see it is not encrypted, it is written in clear text right.
360.810
Let’s solve that in step 5.
363.669
So step 4 is now complete.
367.130
Step 5 is to enable password encryption on the devices.
371.349
We can protect passwords by encrypting them to render them unreadable.
375.840
This is done from global configuration mode with the command 'service password-encryption'. Conf t. service password-encryption.
384.639
Okay, that’s all for step 5.
388.199
Step 6 is to once again view the running config.
392.770
I will use the same command as before, and now lets check the password.
397.440
However the command doesn't work.
399.690
That is because we are currently in global configuration mode, and show running-config
403.870
must be entered from privileged exec mode.
406.340
Now, I could type exit to drop back to privileged exec mode and then enter the command.
412.150
But there is one more way, which I demonstrated in the lecture video.
416.110
If I type 'do' in front of the command, I can enter it from global configuration mode. 'do show running-config'. There we go.
426.490
Let's look at the password.
428.199
You can see here 'enable password', followed by a 7 and then a string of other numbers.
434.970
The password has successfully been encrypted.
438.020
Although we didn't type this 7 when we entered the command, it refers to the type of encryption used.
444.289
There are other types as well.
446.599
The string of numbers that follow are the password 'CCNA', encrypted to be unreadable
451.270
so that anyone looking over our shoulder can't read the password.
455.970
Keep in mind that the encryption used in the 'service password-encryption' isn't very secure
460.470
and can be cracked, but this at least renders the password safe from someone simply glancing over your shoulder.
466.480
Step 6 is now complete.
470.620
Step 7 is to configure a more secure, encrypted enable password of ‘Cisco’.
476.090
That can be done with the ‘enable secret’ command.
479.340
The enable secret uses MD5 encryption, which is more secure than what you get with the service password-encryption command.
487.460
Since we’re already in global configuration mode, let’s enter the command. Enable secret Cisco.
494.910
Now let’s go on to Step 8, which is to exit back to user EXEC mode and try to login. Exit. Exit.
502.639
Okay, now let’s try to get back to privileged EXEC mode. Enable.
507.569
Let’s try our original password of ‘CCNA’….it doesn’t work anymore.
513.890
How about our newly configured enable secret? Cisco...okay, that works.
520.190
As you can see, if both an enable secret and enable password are configured, only the enable
525.610
secret can be used.
527.560
The enable password becomes invalid.
531.310
Step 9 is to once again view the passwords in the running configuration. Show running-config. There they are.
539.560
Once again, the enable password with service password-encryption enabled uses type 7 encryption,
544.860
indicated by this 7 here.
547.510
The enable secret uses type 5 encryption, which is MD5 encryption.
553.680
Step 10 is to save the running configuration to the startup configuration.
558.310
There are three ways to do this.
560.780
One is write...another is write memory...and the third is copy running-config startup-config.
569.670
Let’s check if its saved. Show startup-config.
576.520
There's the config, and you can see the passwords we configured here.
581.260
If I scroll through you can see lots of other default settings for the device here.
587.500
Step 10 is now complete.
