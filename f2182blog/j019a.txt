Also, remember to download and use the Anki flashcards with the link in the description,
23.570
which will help you very much in remembering what you have learned. Let’s get started.
28.220
So, Day 10’s video was quite technical, looking at the details of an IP version 4
33.940
header which is used to encapsulate a Layer 4 segment, and then is encapsulated within an Ethernet frame.
41.380
In this video we’ll get a little bit more practical, and begin to see how routers forward traffic between different networks.
48.290
Remember, that’s the role of a router.
51.580
Switches forward traffic WITHIN a LAN.
54.470
Routers forward traffic BETWEEN LANs.
56.699
So, let’s take a look at what we’ll cover in this video.
60.699
We’ll cover the IP routing process.
64.229
Starting from the end host that wants to send a packet to an end host in another network,
68.650
I’ll give you an overview of the routing process, specifically as it applies to IP, the Internet Protocol.
75.490
We’ll examine the routing table on a Cisco router.
79.830
Routers keep a routing table, which stores a list of known destinations, and how to get there.
85.740
It’s important to be very familiar with the routing table, as you’ll be using the
89.950
'show ip route' command a lot as a network engineer.
93.670
Also, we’ll look at how to configure static routes, which are routes you manually configure on a router.
100.730
Here’s the network topology we’ll be using in this video.
104.640
Let me give you a quick run-through of the topology.
108.570
There are two LANs I’ve illustrated here.
111.520
This one, connected to R1, is the 192.168.1.0/24 network.
117.460
PC1 has an IP address of 192.168.1.1, and R1 has an IP address of 192.168.1.254 on its G0/2 interface.
130.920
There is also this LAN, connected to R4, the 192.168.4.0/24 network.
137.340
PC4 has an IP address of 192.168.1.4, and R4 has an IP address of 192.168.1.254 on its G0/2 interface.
151.230
Those are the LANs, but these four routers represent not a LAN, but rather a WAN, which
157.340
stands for Wide Area Network.
160.280
These routers could be kilometers apart, connected by single mode fiber.
165.080
Basically, the definition of a WAN is a network that spreads over a large area.
170.900
Let’s look at the IP addresses.
174.400
Between R1 and R2 is the 192.16.12.0/24 network, between R2 and R4 is the 192.168.24.0/24 network,
187.600
between R1 and R3 is the 192.168.13.0/24 network, and between R3 and R4 is the 192.168.34.0/24 network.
200.960
I numbered the networks like this to make it easy to understand for this demonstration,
205.040
but you’re probably not going to find networks numbered like this in the real world.
209.879
But when you’re doing labs, its helpful to make the IP addresses simple to understand.
214.750
So, PC1 wants to send this packet to PC4.
220.530
Notice that the source IP address is 192.168.1.1, PC1’s IP address, and the destination IP
228.239
address is 192.168.4.1, PC4’s IP address.
234.310
What does PC1 do from here?
236.650
First, it asks itself this question, Is the destination IP address in the same network?
243.769
Well, PC1’s IP address is 192.168.1.1/24.
248.290
/24 means that the first 3 octets are the network portion so 192.168.1 is the network
257.519
portion of the address. How about PC4?
261.870
Its address is 192.168.4.1/24, so 192.168.4 is the network portion.
269.990
So, the answer is NO, these two end hosts are in different networks.
275.400
Because of this, PC1 can’t forward the packet directly to PC4.
279.520
So, because the destination is in a different network, a different LAN, routing logic tells
285.719
PC1 to send the packet to the ‘default gateway’.
289.620
The default gateway is the device to which the host, in this case PC1, will forward data
294.839
that is destined for another network.
297.889
What do you think PC1’s default gateway is?
300.870
The answer is R1.
304.009
Routers are the devices used to connect separate networks, for example R1 connects the 192.168.1.0/24,
311.740
192.168.12.0/24, and 192.168.13.0/24 networks.
320.960
So, to reach other networks, an end host will send the packet to its network’s router,
325.789
the default gateway, which is R1 in this case.
329.979
Now R1 has the packet, and its R1’s responsibility to forward it to the next device.
336.599
After receiving the packet, R1 will compare the packet’s destination IP address to the routing table.
343.180
As I said in the introduction to this video, each router keeps a routing table, which stores
347.919
a list of destinations, and how to reach the destination.
351.539
Assuming R1 already has an entry in its routing table for the 192.168.4.0/24 network, the entry
359.740
will look something like this….
363.370
First is the destination, which is the 192.168.4.0/24 network.
370.009
Next is the ‘next hop’, the next destination in the path to the 192.168.4.0/24 network,
377.629
the final destination, and also the interface out of which R1 will send the packet.
384.449
In this case, R1 could reach the network either by sending it to R2 or R3, but let’s say
390.690
we configured it to send it via R2, as you can tell by both the next-hop address
396.180
of 192.168.12.2, and the exit interface on R1, g0/0.
403.029
We’ll take a look at configuring routes, as well as take a look at a real routing table
407.840
on a Cisco router, in a few minutes.
410.419
So, R1 will forward the packet to the next router on the route to the destination, which is R2.
418.089
So, now R2 has the packet, and it’s R2’s responsibility to forward the packet to the next device.
425.740
It will follow the same process as R1, It will compare the packet’s destination IP
431.060
address to the routing table and then, assuming it already has an entry in its routing table
435.889
for the destination, It might look something like this.
440.410
The destination is 192.168.4.0/24, the next hop address is 192.168.24.4, R4’s IP address,
452.099
and the exit interface is g0/1, which is connected to R4.
457.539
After looking up the route in the routing table, R2 forwards the packet to R4.
463.460
Now R4 has the packet, and it is R4’s responsibility to forward the packet to the next device.
469.749
It will follow the same process as both R1 and R2, it will compare the packet’s destination
475.010
IP address to the routing table.
477.729
In R4’s case, the entry in the table will look something like this.
483.029
192.168.4.0/24 is directly connected, G0/2.
488.270
That’s because R4 has an IP address of 192.168.4.254/24 configured on its G0/2 interface, so it knows
498.479
the 192.168.4.0/24 network is directly connected to that interface.
505.500
It forwards the packet out of that interface, and SW4 passes it on to PC4, the final destination.
512.580
Now, this has been a very simple overview of how this process works.
517.330
Notice that I didn’t mention MAC addresses, or Layer 2 at all.
521.580
This is just a Layer 3 overview of this process.
524.020
I will make a dedicated video called ‘Life of a Packet’, in which I follow this same
529.570
process, but go in depth about not just Layer 3, but also Layer 2.
535.330
You may have noticed that, during this whole process, the source and destination IP addresses have not changed.
541.910
That is not the case for the MAC addresses, so you’ll see that the process is a little
545.940
more complex than I showed you here.
548.710
But this basic overview should be enough for you to understand the rest of this video.
552.450
Let’s finally go on to the CLI of a Cisco router.
556.030
So, we’re on the CLI of PC1.
560.910
Actually, this isn’t a PC.
564.010
Rather than taking the time to set up a virtual PC in GNS3, I just used a Cisco router and
570.070
changed the icon to a PC.
572.190
So, we can use this to learn about the Cisco CLI, too.
577.210
So I used the command ‘show ip route’ from privileged exec mode, and it displays the routing table.
584.650
Down here under the codes at the top two routes are displayed.
589.250
This may seem like three routes, but this line at the top, 192.168.1.0/24 is variably
596.780
subnetted, 2 subnets, 2 masks, isn’t a route.
601.520
This lists the classful address, and what class is 192.168.1.0/24?
609.020
It’s a class C address. Underneath are the two routes that fit within that class.
615.260
If you don’t understand this all yet, just wait.
617.490
We will talk about subnetting, classful, and classless networks a few videos later.
624.460
For now, just realize that this top line isn’t a route.
627.740
Okay, so we’ve got two routes, and these two letters on the left, C and L, display
634.371
the type of route.
635.500
What do they mean?
637.330
Well, let’s look them up in the list up top.
640.890
L stands for Local, and C stands for connected. What’s the difference?
646.550
Well, let’s look at this Connected route first.
649.680
It’s a route to 192.168.1.0/24.
655.490
The IP address configured on PC1’s interface is 192.168.1.1/24, so 192.168.1.0/24 the network
666.940
address, the address with a host portion of all 0s. /24 means that the first three octets
673.410
are the network portion, and the last octet is the host portion.
678.090
Set the host portion to 0, and that’s the network address.
682.620
There are probably lots of other hosts on this network, maybe with addresses like 192.168.1.2/24, 192.168.1.3/24, 192.168.1.4/24. etc.
698.930
All of them are part of the 192.168.1.0/24 network, because the network portion of their
705.040
address is the same.
706.820
So, PC1 knows it can reach any host on the 192.168.1.0/24 network via its network
714.340
interface, which is gigabitethernet0/0 on this Cisco router which I’m using to simulate a PC.
722.000
Next up is the local route.
724.120
Look at this one, 192.168.1.1, which is the exact address on PC1’s interface, but this
731.060
time with a /32 mask.
733.920
We haven’t seen a /32 mask before.
736.710
/32 would mean that all four octets are the network portion, and there is no host portion.
742.910
Well, that is correct.
744.990
You could say this is a route to the 192.168.1.1/32 network, and there is only one address in the network, 192.168.1.1.
756.280
This is how you identify a single, specific address, by using a /32 mask.
763.120
so, to recap, the connected route indicates the network to which the interface is attached,
769.310
and the local route indicates the actual address configured on the interface, with a /32 mask.
775.600
So, that means that you already know how to configure two types of routes on a Cisco router.
781.710
If you configure an IP address on an interface and enable the interface, the connected and
787.060
local routes of that interface are added.
790.440
However, this PC doesn’t have a route to the intended destination, 192.168.4.1.
798.060
Actually, that’s not a problem.
800.840
An end host like a PC doesn’t need to know the route to every destination.
806.330
All it needs is a default gateway to which it can send any traffic destined for a location
811.160
outside of the local network.
814.070
On a Cisco router, the default gateway is known as the ‘gateway of last resort’,
819.550
and as it says here, it is not set yet.
822.230
So, let’s configure the default gateway on our PC, which as I said before is actually a Cisco router.
829.980
To configure the default gateway, also known as the gateway of last resort, on a Cisco
834.920
router, you have to configure what’s called a ‘default route’.
839.410
A default route is a route that matches ALL possible destinations.
844.260
However, it is used only if a more specific route match isn’t found in the routing table.
851.000
When a router looks up a route to a destination in its routing table, it looks for the most
855.800
specific match, and chooses that route.
859.600
The default route is the LEAST SPECIFIC possible route.
863.500
What does that mean?
864.970
Well, it uses an IP address of 0.0.0.0, and a mask of 0.0.0.0.
872.410
So, To set the default route or gateway of last resort, configure a route to 0.0.0.0/0.
882.270
Think about what that means.
884.520
The /0 means that there is no ‘network portion’ of the address, no fixed part of the address that can’t change.
893.220
So that means 0.0.0.0/0 covers the range of address from 0.0.0.0 through 255.255.255.255,
905.390
which is ALL possible addresses.
909.370
Let me give a little explanation that might help you understand this.
913.360
Here is the 192.168.1.0/24 network, like the destination of that connected route in the
920.250
routing table we just looked at.
922.529
/24 means that the mask is 255.255.255.0.
929.100
This mask means that these first three octets are fixed, they can’t change.
934.589
However, this part, which isn’t covered by the mask, is not fixed.
939.420
It could be 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3, etc.
949.120
So, 192.168.1.0/24 matches all addresses from 192.168.1.0 through 192.168.1.255.
963.560
So, how about 192.168.1.1/32, the destination of that local route we saw in the routing table?
971.630
/32 means a mask of 255.255.255.255.
978.000
ALL bits in ALL octets of the address are covered by the mask.
982.580
What does that mean?
984.290
All bits are FIXED, they can’t change.
986.950
So, that means that 192.168.1.1/32 matches ONLY a single address, 192.168.1.1.
997.240
That’s why the /32 mask is used to specify the exact address configured on the interface
1003.000
in the local route.
1004.920
Now, for the opposite of that very specific /32 address, how about 0.0.0.0/0?
1012.270
/0 means a mask of 0.0.0.0, which means that none of the bits in any of these octets are
1020.240
covered by the mask, they are all not fixed.
1024.839
That means that 0.0.0.0/0 matches 0.0.0.0 through 255.255.255.255, which is ALL possible addresses.
1037.209
I think you can see why I called this the ‘least specific’ route.
1041.949
It doesn’t specify a single address, it includes ALL possible addresses.
1047.829
So, let’s get to actually configuring this default route.
1052.380
To do so, we have to learn how to configure a ‘static route’.
1056.580
Basically, a static route is a route you manually configure yourself.
1061.820
This is different than the connected and local routes we saw before, which are automatically
1066.200
added to the routing table when we configure an IP address on an interface and enable it.
1071.990
Here’s the command to configure a static route.
1075.570
It’s IP ROUTE, followed by the destination address, the mask for the destination address,
1082.850
and then the next-hop IP address.
1086.009
So here, I used the configure terminal command to enter global config mode, and then used
1091.360
the IP route command to configure PC1’s default route to R1.
1096.750
Here is the destination address, here is the mask, and here is the next hop IP address, which is R1’s
1104.720
So, from global config mode I used DO SHOW IP ROUTE to check the routing table once more,
1112.450
and first off, you can see it says ‘gateway of last resort is 192.168.1.254 to network 0.0.0.0.
1122.899
The default route also appears down here with the other routes.
1126.919
Notice that the code on the left is different.
1129.679
We have an S and an asterisk.
1132.370
Let’s look up top again to see what these mean.
1135.820
S means static, which as I just explained before is a route we manually configure on
1140.999
the device, rather than one automatically added like the local and connected routes in the table.
1147.500
The asterisk means it is a ‘candidate default’ route.
1151.980
The fact that we can see it is added as the gateway of last resort means it isn’t just
1156.180
a candidate, it was selected as the default route, but its still labeled as a candidate default route.
1162.540
Okay, so looking back at our topology, since PC1 now has a default gateway configured,
1169.850
known as a gateway of last resort on a Cisco router, it sends the packet to the default
1174.539
gateway as I showed before.
1177.200
Just a reminder, PC1 isn’t actually a PC, it’s a Cisco router.
1182.870
Since I’m just using it to ping, I didn’t bother setting up a virtual PC, it’s easier
1187.559
to just use a router to ping.
1189.620
So, since R1 has the packet now, let’s take a look at its routing table to see what it
1195.059
will do with the packet.
1198.070
So I used SHOW IP ROUTE on R1, and there’s the routing table.
1203.580
Because R1 is connected to three networks, 192.168.1.0/24, 192.168.12.0/24, and 192.168.13.0/24,
1216.450
it has connected routes for each of those networks, as well as the local routes for
1220.179
the IP addresses configured on its interfaces.
1222.730
However, there’s a problem.
1225.409
The packet’s destination is 192.168.4.1, in the 192.168.4.0/24 network, but its not
1234.409
in the routing table.
1236.700
If this were a switch receiving a frame with an unknown destination MAC address, what would it do?
1242.649
It would flood the frame out of all of its interfaces.
1246.299
How about in this case, what will a router do when it receives a packet with an unknown destination IP address?
1252.499
Well, it won’t flood it.
1254.989
It will simply drop the packet.
1257.400
Let me review that point.
1259.490
Switches flood frames with unknown destinations, meaning destinations not in the MAC address table.
1265.779
Routers, however, drop packets with unknown destination IP addresses.
1270.580
So, unless we configure a route on R1, this ping will not succeed.
1275.419
So, let’s configure a static route on R1 aimed for the 192.168.4.0/24 network.
1284.710
This time I’ll show you a slight variation of the command.
1287.919
ip route, followed by the destination IP address, the mask, and the exit interface. What’s different? Its this.
1298.590
Last time we configured the next hop address.
1300.789
This time, instead of specifying an IP address as the next hop, we just specify the exit
1306.570
interface, the interface out of which R1 should send the packet.
1311.710
If we do it on R1, it will look like this.
1314.860
ip route, followed by 192.168.4.0, the destination IP address, then 255.255.255.0, the mask,
1326.100
finally gigabitethernet0/0, the exit interface.
1330.639
Okay, so after configuring the route I used ‘do show ip route’ on R1 to view the routing table.
1338.269
Here’s the route we configured.
1340.580
You may notice an interesting difference here.
1343.419
Because we configured an exit interface instead of a next-hop IP address, it says 192.168.4.0/24
1351.570
is directly connected to the gigabitethernet 0/0 interface.
1356.100
The code still says S for static though.
1359.160
You can use either way to configure, later in the course I’ll show you some cases where
1363.270
you will want to use one way instead of the other, but for now you can just use either
1367.529
the next-hop IP address or the exit interface.
1372.150
Notice how this static route isn’t added as the gateway of last resort, because it
1376.169
is for a specific network, not for 0.0.0.0/0 which matches all networks.
1383.690
Okay, now R1 has a route in its routing table for the destination.
1389.269
The destination of this packet is 192.168.4.1, which is included in the 192.168.4.0/24 network.
1399.020
We don’t need a route to the exact destination.
1402.389
Because 192.168.4.1 is included in the 192.168.4.0/24 range, it’s fine, it matches.
1410.559
So, R1 forwards the packet to R2.
1415.549
You can probably guess that there will be a problem here, though...R2 also doesn’t
1420.330
have a route that matches 192.168.4.1.
1423.730
So, I went ahead and configured a route on R2, ip route 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0, and
1435.559
this time specified the next-hop IP address of 192.168.24.4, which is R4’s IP address.
1444.179
You can see the route here.
1445.809
Let’s focus on this part at the end, via 192.168.24.4.
1454.020
So, R2 receives the packet with the destination 192.168.4.1 and looks up the most specific
1460.809
match in its routing table.
1463.080
It finds this entry for 192.168.4.0/24, and it says via 192.168.24.4.
1472.800
What does R2 do next?
1474.920
Well, it then looks up the most specific match for 192.168.24.4.
1480.960
That is this route here, which is a directly connected route on gigabitethernet0/1, so
1486.889
it will forward the packet out of that interface.
1489.690
So, R2 sends the packet to R4. What happens next?
1495.909
We haven’t configured any static routes on R4, will that be a problem?
1499.789
Let’s check the routing table on R4.
1502.539
Here’s R4’s routing table.
1506.190
Because R4’s G0/2 interface has an IP address of 192.168.4.254 configured, the 192.168.4.0/24
1516.669
network has automatically been added to its routing table as a connected route.
1521.080
So, R4 sends the packet out of its G0/2 interface, and SW4 forwards it to PC4.
1529.120
Let’s actually try that ping form PC1 to PC4 and see if it works now!
1534.909
So, I use the command ping 192.168.4.1 on PC1 to send a ping to PC4.
1542.889
However, as you can see, the ping fails, success rate is 0 percent, 0 out of 5.
1550.710
PC1 has a default gateway, all of the routers along the way know how to reach PC4, so what’s the problem?
1558.460
The problem is one-way reachability.
1561.490
What does that mean?
1562.830
Well, the packet from PC1 was able to reach PC4.
1567.240
R1, R2, and R4 all have routes to the 192.168.4.0/24 network.
1575.100
However, to send a reply back PC4 sends packets with a source address of 192.168.4.1 and a
1582.980
destination address of 192.168.1.1.
1586.680
Can you see the problem?
1588.920
R4 and R2 have no route to reach the 192.168.1.0/24 network.
1594.830
R1 can reach it of course, since its a connected network, but let’s take a quick look at
1599.789
the routing table of R2 and R4 again.
1603.190
Here’s R4’s routing table….no route to 192.168.1.0/24.
1610.690
And here’s R2’s routing table..also no route to 192.168.1.0/24.
1617.759
Not to mention, I also haven’t configured the default gateway on PC4.
1621.450
I’ll quickly run through the configurations.
1624.989
Okay, so I configured the default route on PC4 like I did on PC1.
1630.509
Same as for PC1, I’m just using another Cisco router instead of an actual PC.
1635.989
You can see the static route I configured, and it has been selected as the gateway of
1640.049
last resort, the default gateway.
1642.429
Here’s R4’s routing table.
1645.779
You can see the static route I configured to the 192.168.1.0/24 network, and the next-hop
1651.880
IP address is R2’s address.
1655.600
And finally R2’s routing table.
1657.679
Here’s the static route I configured to the 192.168.1.0/24 network, with a next-hop
1663.920
IP address of 192.168.12.1, R1’s IP address.
1669.620
Okay, let’s try that ping once more.
1671.840
We should have two-way reachability now.
1675.250
Okay, now that we have configured static routes in both directions, you can see that the ping succeeds.
1682.499
Before reviewing and moving on to the quiz, let me clarify one point I mentioned before.
1688.029
Earlier I mentioned that, when a router looks up a destination IP address in its routing
1693.029
table, it looks for the most specific matching route.
1697.279
What does that mean?
1698.450
Well, most specific means the longest prefix length.
1702.869
For example, /32 is more specific than /24.
1707.109
/24 is more specific than /16.
1710.659
/16 is more specific than /8.
1714.200
And /8 is more specific than /0.
1718.200
Here I’ve added one more link to our topology between R1 and R4.
1722.010
It’s the 192.168.14.0/24 network, with R1’s address being 192.168.14.1 and R4’s 192.168.14.4.
1735.600
I also configured some extra routes, lets check the route table.
1739.789
So, here’s R1’s routing table now.
1743.119
You can pause the video to take a look if you want.
1745.619
Let’s say I issue the command ‘ping 192.168.4.1’ on R1.
1753.129
Before thinking about which is the MOST SPECIFIC matching route, how many routes actually match
1758.289
192.168.4.1? pause the video and find how many matching routes there are.
1766.100
Okay. Well, here’s one.
1768.960
192.168.4.1/32 is an exact match, so actually I can tell you right away that this not only matches,
1776.620
it is also the most specific match. 192.168.4.0/24 also matches.
1783.429
Although the last octet is different, .0 and .1, because that octet isn’t covered by
1789.710
the mask, it doesn’t matter if it changes, it still matches 192.168.4.1.
1795.039
Now, there is one more match, did you find it?
1799.539
It’s this one, 192.0.0.0/8.
1804.769
We haven’t yet seen a class C address like this with a /8 mask, but it follows the same logic.
1810.779
/8 means that only the first octet is covered by the mask.
1815.309
The other three octets can vary, and they will still match.
1819.890
So, 192.168.4.1 does match 192.0.0.0/8.
1825.159
However, as I said, 192.168.4.1 is the most specific route, since it has the longest prefix
1833.480
length, /32, so in this case the router will choose that route. Here’s another example. Ping 192.168.4.254.
1844.759
This time, there are just two matches, 192.168.4.0/24 and 192.0.0.0/8.
1853.640
Which route will the router choose? It will choose
1856.680
192.168.4.0/24, because it has the longer prefix length.
1862.950
Okay, once again that was a lot of material to cover.
1866.649
If there’s anything you don’t understand, try watching those parts of the video again,
1871.729
or feel free to ask questions in the comments.
1874.970
If your question is something I will answer soon in another video, I may just tell you
1879.039
to wait, but I try to respond to every comment!
1882.389
Anyway, before moving on to the quiz, lets review what we covered in this video.
1886.830
We covered the IP routing process, showing how routers look up destination IP addresses
1892.809
in their routing tables to find the next hop in the route to the destination.
1898.039
speaking of routing tables, I also introduced the routing table on Cisco routers.
1902.850
There’s still more to talk about regarding the routing table, but don’t worry there
1907.129
will be plenty more videos about routing coming up!
1910.769
We also looked at configuring static routes, using this command.
1914.440
IP ROUTE, followed by the destination IP address, the mask, and then either the next-hop address
1921.269
or the exit interface.
1923.009
Okay, let’s move on to today’s quiz.
1927.009
In addition to the quiz, remember to check out the flashcards with the link in the description,
1931.929
they will help you remember what you’ve learned in this video.
1934.169
Let’s get started with question 1.
1938.109
The IP address configured on a router interface will appear in the routing table as what kind of route? A, static. B, connected. C, local. Or D, internal.
1951.629
Pause the video to think about your answer.
1957.419
The answer is C, Local.
1960.259
As you can see here, Local addresses use a /32 mask, which specifies the exact address
1965.980
configured on the interface.
1968.649
Connected addresses represent the network that the local address is part of.
1973.110
Static addresses are manually configured addresses, unlike connected and local addresses which
1978.070
are automatically added when you configure an IP address on an interface and enable it.
1983.679
Internal is not a type of route you can find in the routing table.
1986.989
Let’s go to question 2.
1989.690
Which command configures a default route on a Cisco router?
1994.710
Pause the video to examine each option and determine the correct answer.
2003.990
The answer is A, IP ROUTE 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.1.1.254.
2014.109
Default routes are configured as static routes with this syntax: IP ROUTE, followed by the
2019.259
destination IP address, the mask, and then the next-hop IP or exit interface.
2027.230
Specifying a destination address of 0.0.0.0 with a mask of 0.0.0.0 matches all routes,
2034.609
thus making it a default route that the device uses only if a packet’s destination address
2039.559
doesn’t match anything else in the routing table.
2042.789
You can’t specify a prefix length with a / in this command, you have to write out the
2046.999
mask in dotted decimal format.
2049.030
Let’s go to question 3.
2052.990
Which is an accurate statement about the behavior of routers and switches?
2057.419
A, Routers flood packets with an unknown destination IP address, switches flood frames with an
2063.840
unknown destination MAC address.
2066.679
B, Routers drop packets with an unknown destination IP address, switches drop frames with an unknown destination MAC address.
2076.000
C, Routers drop packets with an unknown destination IP address, switches flood frames with an
2082.650
unknown destination MAC address.
2084.620
Pause the video to think about your answer.
2091.610
The answer is C, Routers drop packets with an unknown destination IP address, but switches
2097.260
flood frames with an unknown destination MAC address.
2100.660
However, you can configure a gateway of last resort on a router, which tells the route
2105.880
where to forward packets that don’t match any other address in the routing table.
2109.920
Let’s go to question 4.
2113.940
Which two types of addresses are automatically added to the routing table when you configure
2118.060
an IP address on an interface and enable it?
2121.240
A, connected and static.
2124.310
B, local and static.
2127.360
C, default and local.
2130.020
D, connected and local.
2133.180
Pause the video to think about your answer.
2139.480
The answer is D, connected and local.
2142.870
As I mentioned in the explanation for question 1, a local route is the actual IP address
2148.180
configured on the interface, and a connected route is the network the interface is a member of.
2154.090
Let’s go to question 5.
2157.070
Which interface will be used to forward a packet with a destination IP address of 10.1.1.1?
2163.920
Pause the video to take a look at R1’s routing table and find the correct answer.
2171.780
Okay, the correct answer is gigabitethernet0/3.
2177.360
The most specific match for the destination 10.1.1.1 is this route, 10.1.1.0/24 via 192.168.14.4.
2189.240
If you then look up the most specific match for 192.168.14.4, you’ll find this route
2195.410
to 192.168.14.0/24, which specifies that the packet will be forwarded out of the gigabitethernet0/3 interface.
2204.690
Okay, that’s all for the quiz.
2209.040
Remember to use the supplementary materials to help you remember what you’ve studied.
2213.550
There will be Anki flashcards to help you review what you’ve studied.
2217.310
There will also be a packet tracer practice lab so you can get some hands-on practice
2220.910
configuring static routes on Cisco routers.
2223.720
