practice lab you can download the lab

file from the link in the description if

you like these labs please consider

supporting me via my patreon or the

cryptocurrency options in the

description in this lab we will take a

look at the routing information protocol

known as rip rip is a dynamic routing

protocol as opposed to the static

routing we configured in the previous

few labs in dynamic routing protocols

routers share information with each

other to determine the best paths to

destinations in the network rip is a

very simple but limited routing protocol

you probably won't find it in use in a

real life networking scenario you'll

rather find a EIGRP or OSPF however rip

is nice and simple and good for learning

the basics of routing protocols and for

setting up quick labs you should also be

familiar with it for the test in this

lab we will do some basic rip

configurations on two routers r1 and r2

try to complete the lab yourself first

then continue watching this video if you

have trouble or watch it after to check

your solution

step one is to configure rip on r1 and

r2 without enabling version two so we'll

keep that rip version one I'll go on r1

first enable compte we configure rip

with this command router rip now our one

is only connected to one network

192.168.1.0 so let's activate rip on

that interface we can do that with the

network command network 192.168.1.0 now

let's go on our to enable compte router

rip network 192.168.1.0 now we can

activate rip on our two's two other

interfaces with just one command that is

network 10000 this will activate rip on

all interfaces with an IP address

falling within the 10000 / 8 class a

network the 10.10 network connected to F

0 0 and the 10.20 network connected to F

1 0 both fall within this larger class a

network and thus rip will be activated

on them note that when you use the

network command you are telling the

router which network to advertise your

tongue the router which interfaces to

activate rip on and then it will

advertise those networks to neighbors or

that would be the case however rip

version 1 is by its nature a classful

routing protocol let's see what that

means let's go back on our one do show

IP route as you can see our one has

learned not the 1001 0/24 and 10.20 / 24

networks but rather the 10000 / 8

network from r2 this is because rip

version 1 automatically summarizes

network

to their classful network if you don't

know about class-a EBC and such networks

I won't go into a full explanation here

but you will learn about them in your

studies that was step 2 now let's go to

step 3 and enable rip version 2 and

disable that Auto summarization since

we're on our one let's do it here first

version 2 that enables rip version 2 no

Auto summary that disables Auto summary

now let's go on our two version 2 no

Auto summary ok now our two will start

advertising it's 10:01 0/24 and 10.2

0/24 networks to our one instead of

summarizing them to the class a network

1000 - o / 8 summarization is often a

good thing in networks and actually in

this little network here it makes sense

however it can also cause a lot of

problems and if you're going to be

summarizing in networks you'll want to

do it manually that's a topic for

another time though let's go check on

our one do you show IP route well we

still see that 1000 dot o / 8 network

don't worry about that it will be

cleared out of the route table in time

since it has stopped receiving updates

for it

from our - but now we can also see the

1001 0/24 and 1002 0/24 networks so

there's the big difference between rip

version 1 and rip version 2 rip version

1 always automatically summarizes

networks whereas in version 2 you can

and should disable auto summarization
