description 15.305666 in this lab we will take a
look at the routing information protocol
known as rip 22.083035 rip is a dynamic routing
protocol as opposed to the static
routing we configured in the previous
few labs 28.675555 in dynamic routing protocols
routers share information with each
other to determine the best paths to
destinations in the network 37.257468 rip is a
very simple but limited routing protocol
41.306790 you probably won't find it in use in a
real life networking scenario 45.834710 you'll
rather find a EIGRP or OSPF 49.389079 however rip
is nice and simple and good for learning
the basics of routing protocols 55.362969 and for
setting up quick labs 57.285565 you should also be
familiar with it for the test 60.628357 in this
lab we will do some basic rip
configurations on two routers r1 and r2
66.986836 try to complete the lab yourself first
then continue watching this video if you
have trouble 72.758840 or watch it after to check
your solution
75.147343 step one is to configure rip on r1 and
r2 without enabling version two 83.104037 so we'll
keep that rip version one 85.482525 I'll go on r1
first 88.020809 enable conf t we configure rip
with this command 95.413080 router rip 96.936878 now our one
is only connected to one network
100.774801 192.168.1.0 so let's activate rip on
that interface 105.433844 we can do that with the
network command 108.067482 network 192.168.1.0 112.377320 now
let's go on r2 114.907305 enable conf t router
rip network 192.168.1.0 now we can
activate rip on our two's two other
interfaces with just one command that is
network 10000 this will activate rip on
all interfaces with an IP address
falling within the 10000 / 8 class a
network the 10.10 network connected to F
0 0 and the 10.20 network connected to F
1 0 both fall within this larger class a
network and thus rip will be activated
on them note that when you use the
network command you are telling the
router which network to advertise your
tongue the router which interfaces to
activate rip on and then it will
advertise those networks to neighbors or
that would be the case however rip
version 1 is by its nature a classful
routing protocol let's see what that
means let's go back on our one do show
IP route as you can see our one has
learned not the 1001 0/24 and 10.20 / 24
networks but rather the 10000 / 8
network from r2 this is because rip
version 1 automatically summarizes
network
to their classful network if you don't
know about class-a EBC and such networks
I won't go into a full explanation here
but you will learn about them in your
studies that was step 2 now let's go to
step 3 and enable rip version 2 and
disable that Auto summarization since
we're on our one let's do it here first
version 2 that enables rip version 2 no
Auto summary that disables Auto summary
now let's go on our two version 2 no
Auto summary ok now our two will start
advertising it's 10:01 0/24 and 10.2
0/24 networks to our one instead of
summarizing them to the class a network
1000 - o / 8 summarization is often a
good thing in networks and actually in
this little network here it makes sense
however it can also cause a lot of
problems and if you're going to be
summarizing in networks you'll want to
do it manually that's a topic for
another time though let's go check on
our one do you show IP route well we
still see that 1000 dot o / 8 network
don't worry about that it will be
cleared out of the route table in time
since it has stopped receiving updates
for it
from our - but now we can also see the
1001 0/24 and 1002 0/24 networks so
there's the big difference between rip
version 1 and rip version 2 rip version
1 always automatically summarizes
networks whereas in version 2 you can
and should disable auto summarization
