description 15.305666 in this lab we will take a
look at the routing information protocol
known as rip 22.083035 rip is a dynamic routing
protocol as opposed to the static
routing we configured in the previous
few labs 28.675555 in dynamic routing protocols
routers share information with each
other to determine the best paths to
destinations in the network 37.257468 rip is a
very simple but limited routing protocol
41.306790 you probably won't find it in use in a
real life networking scenario 45.834710 you'll
rather find a EIGRP or OSPF 49.389079 however rip
is nice and simple and good for learning
the basics of routing protocols 55.362969 and for
setting up quick labs 57.285565 you should also be
familiar with it for the test 60.628357 in this
lab we will do some basic rip
configurations on two routers r1 and r2
66.986836 try to complete the lab yourself first
then continue watching this video if you
have trouble 72.758840 or watch it after to check
your solution
75.147343 step one is to configure rip on r1 and
r2 without enabling version two 83.104037 so we'll
keep that rip version one 85.482525 I'll go on r1
first 88.020809 enable conf t we configure rip
with this command 95.413080 router rip 96.936878 now our one
is only connected to one network
100.774801 192.168.1.0 so let's activate rip on
that interface 105.433844 we can do that with the
network command 108.067482 network 192.168.1.0 112.377320 now
let's go on r2 114.907305 enable conf t router
rip 121.670664 network 192.168.1.0 now we can
activate rip on r2's two other
interfaces with just one command 131.771647 that is
network 10.0.0.0 136.494188 this will activate rip on
all interfaces with an IP address
falling within the 10.0.0.0 / 8 class a
network 144.287191 the 10.0.1.0 network connected to F
0 0 149.757050 and the 10.0.2.0 network connected to F
1 0 154.316066 both fall within this larger class a
network 157.440102 and thus rip will be activated
on them 160.363423 note that when you use the
network command you are telling the
router which network to advertise 166.223460 your
tongue the router which interfaces to
activate rip on 170.143509 and then it will
advertise those networks to neighbors 172.560189 or
that would be the case however 176.297825 rip
version 1 is by its nature a classful
routing protocol 180.596236 let's see what that
means 183.428391 let's go back on r 1 185.883095 do show
IP route 190.454984 as you can see r1 has
learned not the 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0 / 24
networks but rather the 10.0.0.0 / 8
network from r2 204.918459 this is because rip
version 1 automatically summarizes
network
to their classful network 212.289274 if you don't
know about class-a ABC and such networks
217.018117 I won't go into a full explanation here
but you will learn about them in your
studies 220.718708 that was step 2 now let's go to
step 3 and enable rip version 2 and
disable that Auto summarization 231.030881 since
we're on r1 let's do it here first
234.111131 version 2 that enables rip version 2 238.950036 no
Auto summary 241.324472 that disables Auto summary
243.670736 now let's go on r1 246.239246 version 2 no
Auto summary 251.564592 ok now our two will start
advertising it's 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24 networks to r1 262.220431 instead of
summarizing them to the class a network
10.0.0.0 / 8 267.579725 summarization is often a
good thing in networks and actually in
this little network here it makes sense
273.896309 however it can also cause a lot of
problems 276.679737 and if you're going to be
summarizing in networks you'll want to
do it manually 281.028551 that's a topic for
another time though 283.532838 let's go check on
r1 285.733738 do you show IP route 289.618457 well we
still see that 10.0.0.0  / 8 network
295.540824 don't worry about that it will be
cleared out of the route table in time
299.249504 since it has stopped receiving updates
for it
from r2 303.070051  but now we can also see the
10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24 networks 311.276046 so
there's the big difference between rip
version 1 and rip version 2 316.002356 rip version
1 always automatically summarizes
networks 320.973475 whereas in version 2 you can
and should disable auto summarization
