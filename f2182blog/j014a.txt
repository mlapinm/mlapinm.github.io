23.490
which will help you very much in remembering what you have learned. Let’s get started.
29.119
This is the 8th lecture in the series, and part 2 on IPv4 addresses. This should be a
35.550
shorter video than the last one, just covering a few things we missed.
39.830
Let’s go over what we’ll cover in this video. I’ll do a quick review of IPv4 classes,
46.750
and clarify some things I didn’t explain well in the previous video. I’ll explain
51.431
how to find... the maximum number of hosts, the network address, the broadcast address,
58.710
the first usable address, and the last usable address of a particular network. I introduced
65.180
some of these in the previous video, but its worth explaining in more detail. Finally,
70.399
I will outline how to configure IP addresses on Cisco devices, which we’ll then practice
76.259
in packet tracer, in the next video.
80.579
So this is the chart of the IPv4 address classes I showed you in the last video. I taught you
87.140
that the 127 range is reserved for loopback addresses, so its generally not considered
92.590
part of the Class A range. However, the 0 range is also reserved in class A, so some
99.380
might say class A really begins at 1, making the range 1-126. Different sources say different
107.609
things, so I recommend that you remember class A as 0-127, but also keep in mind that 0 and
115.130
127 are reserved, so really the usable range is 1-126.
121.929
We also saw this chart from wikipedia in the last video. Leading bits of 0 for Class A,
127.729
1 0 for class B, and 1 1 0 for Class C. A network number bit field size, also known
136.160
as prefix length, of 8 for class A, 16 for class B, and 24 for class C. a size of ‘rest
145.050
bit field’ also known as the host portion of the address, of 24 bits for class A, 16
151.910
for class B, and 8 for class C. The number of networks available in each class. and finally,
159.470
the number of addresses per network. This is the maximum number of addresses, including
164.870
the network address and broadcast address. Notice how it’s calculated. 2, to the power
170.640
of 8, 16, or 24, that being the length of the host portion. But let’s look at how
177.400
to calculate the maximum number of USABLE addresses, the number of addresses that can
181.950
be assigned to hosts.
183.810
So, let’s take this Class C network 192.168.1.0/24. Because it’s class C, it uses a /24 prefix
194.710
length, and therefore the last octet, the last 8 bits, are the host portion. That means
201.680
that the host portion can be 0 to 255. So, 0 to 255 gives us a total of 256 addresses, which
212.180
is 2 to the power of 8, because there are 8 bits. But, remember those two special address
218.360
types I mentioned in the last video? If the host portion is all 0s, it represents the
223.770
network address, sometimes called the network ID. It can't be assigned to a host. Also, if
231.141
the host portion is all 1s, it is the network broadcast address, the address used to send a message
237.260
to all hosts on the network. It also can’t be assigned to a host. So, actually the maximum
243.870
hosts per network is 2 to the power of 8, minus 2, which is 254 for a class C network like this.
252.250
Now let’s take a look at this class B network, 172.16.0.0/16, through 172.16.255.255. The
263.990
host portion is 16 bits, giving 65,536 possible addresses. However, this address with a host
272.449
portion of all 0s is the network address, and this address with a host portion of all
277.930
1s is the broadcast address, so really the maximum number of hosts in this network, or
283.270
any class B network, is 65,534.
289.960
Now let’s do one more example, with a class A address. 10.0.0.0/8, through 10.255.255.255.
300.629
The host portion is 24 bits, so that gives 16,777,216 possible addresses. This network
311.880
address and this broadcast address can’t be assigned to hosts, however, so the maximum
318.340
number of hosts in this network, or any class A network is really 16,777,214. So, the formula
329.729
for determing the number of hosts on a network is 2 to the power of N, minus 2. N is equal
337.749
to the number of host bits.
341.199
Now let’s calculate the first and last usable addresses for this class C network, 192.168.1.0/24.
349.169
So, this address with a host portion of all 0s is the network address, or network ID.
356.949
Add 1 by changing the last bit of the host portion to 1 and, you get 192.168.1.1, and
364.379
that is the first usable address on the network. So, that’s how you do it. Add one to the
370.229
network address to get the first usable address. How about the last usable address? Well, this
377.691
address with a host portion of all 1s is the broadcast address. Subtract 1 from this address
383.849
by switching the last bit to 0, and you get 192.168.1.254, which is the last usable address.
394.220
Next let’s do the same for this class B network, 172.16.0.0/16. This address with
402.180
a host portion of all 0s is the network address. Add 1 and, you get 172.16.0.1, and that is
411.589
the first usable address on the network. How about the last usable address? This address
417.861
with a host portion of all 1s is the broadcast address. Subtract 1 from this address, and
423.180
you get 172.16.255.254, and that is the last usable address.
431.580
Finally let’s do the same for this class A network, 10.0.0.0/8. This address is the
438.999
network address. Add 1 and, you get 10.0.0.1, and that is the first usable address on the
446.830
network. Next let’s find the last usable address. This address with a host portion
453.150
of all 1s is the broadcast address. Subtract 1, and you get 10.255.255.254,
461.349
which is the last usable address. Okay, so hopefully you understand both how to calculate
466.689
the number of usable addresses in a network, and the first and last usable address in a
472.259
network. Really, we covered this material in the last video, but I wanted to make it
478.080
clear. Now let’s move on to actually configuring a Cisco router with IP addresses!
484.360
So here’s a small network I put together in GNS3, with three small networks connected
489.669
to a single router, R1. Keep in mind that it’s not really realistic to have only a
495.860
single PC connected to each switch, in a real network there would many more hosts and
501.360
possibly more switches in each local area network. So, we have one class A network here,
509.069
10.0.0.0/8. PC1 has the first usable address in the network, 10.0.0.1, and we will assign
517.880
the last usable address, 10.255.255.254, to R1’s gigabit0/0 interface. We have this
527.630
class B network, 172.16.0.0/16. PC2 has the first usable IP address, 172.16.0.1, and we
538.910
will assign the last usable address, 172.16.255.254, to R1’s Gigabit0/1 interface. We also have
549.370
a class C network, 192.168.0.0/24. PC3 has the first usable address, 192.168.0.1, and
561.070
we will assign the last usable address, 192.168.0.254, to R1’s Gigabit0/2 interface. Let’s go
571.149
into the CLI of R1 and make the configurations.
574.820
So, I logged on to the CLI of R1, and as you can see I used ‘EN’, the shortcut of the
582.620
enable command, to enter privileged exec mode. Now, let me show you a great command you can
588.360
use to confirm the status of each interface on the device, as well as their IP addresses.
594.720
That is the ‘show ip interface brief’ command. Let’s check out the info this command
600.360
gives us. First off, the interface column lists the network interfaces on the device.
607.620
As you can see, this router has four interfaces, gigabiterthernet 0/0, 0/1, 0/2, and 0/3. The
617.130
next column lists the IP address of each interface. As you can see, they are all unassigned at
622.750
the moment, but we will soon assign IP addresses to the top three interfaces. We’ll use this
628.450
command again afterward to check. Next is the ‘OK?’ column. I think this is a legacy
635.260
feature of the command, its not relevant anymore. Basically, it says whether or not the IP address
641.500
is valid or not. On modern devices, the device won’t let you assign invalid IP addresses,
648.060
so you should never see ‘NO’ in this column. The interfaces currently have no IP addresses
654.440
assigned, and as you can see, that is considered a valid state. Next is the method column.
661.390
This indicates the method by which the interface was assigned an IP address. Currently the
666.740
status is unset, but let’s check what it is after we assign IP addresses. Next is the
673.450
status column. Basically, you can consider this the Layer 1 status of the interface.
680.550
If the interface is enabled, there is a cable connected, and the other end of the cable
685.730
is properly connected to another device, you should see ‘up’ here. However, here it
691.209
displays ‘administratively down’. This means the interface has been disabled with
696.790
the ‘shutdown’ command. However, I haven’t done any configuration on the interfaces yet.
702.990
So, this is the default status of Cisco router interfaces. We haven’t looked at switch
709.220
interfaces yet, but Cisco switch interfaces are NOT administratively down by default.
716.050
They will either be up, if they are connected to another device, or down, if they are not
721.370
connected. Notice that, even though gigabit ethernet 0/0, 0/1, and 0/2 on this router
728.509
are connected to switches, the interfaces remain administratively down because the ‘shutdown’
734.240
command is applied to them by default. The final field of the output is ‘protocol’.
740.389
While the ‘status’ column referred to the Layer 1 status of the interface, this
746.089
is the Layer 2 status. Because the interfaces are down at Layer 1, layer 2 cant operate,
753.490
so all of these interfaces are down at Layer 2. You’ll never see an interface with a
758.540
‘down’ in the status column and ‘up’ in the protocol column, although the reverse
764.040
is possible. Once we configure these interfaces and enable them, we should see up in both
770.810
the status and protocol columns. So, remember these points, the ‘status’ column refers
777.060
to the Layer 1 status, for example is the interface shutdown, is there a cable attached, etc.
784.980
The protocol column refers to the layer 2 status, for example is Ethernet functioning properly
790.640
between this device and the device it's connected to. Expect both of these columns to show up
796.980
once we’re finished with our configurations!
799.550
So, let’s configure the gigabitethernet0/0 interface first. I use conf t, the shortcut
807.379
of the ‘configure terminal’ command to enter global config mode. Next, to configure
813.110
the interface itself, I have to enter interface config mode. So, I use the command ‘interface’,
820.230
followed by the name of the interface, gigabitethernet 0/0. As you can see, it now displays config-if
828.519
beside the hostname of the device. Now, before we move on, let me show you some other ways
834.329
to enter interface configuration mode. First off, notice that you don’t need the space
840.149
between ‘gigabitethernet’ and 0/0, you can connect them and the CLI will still understand
846.810
and bring you to interface configuration mode for that interface. Now, how about the shortcut
853.639
version of the command? Well, as you can see, there are many possible commands beginning
858.730
with ‘i’ from global config mode, so that’s too short. However, there is only one option
865.399
beginning with ‘in’, so that’s the shortest version of the command. Keep in mind, you
871.839
don’t have to use or even remember what the shortest version of each command is. For
876.740
example I always type ‘int’ for interface, even though ‘in’ would work too. Just
883.640
use whatever is comfortable for you. It may even help you remember the commands if you
888.370
type the whole thing out every time. Okay, now how about the short version of gigabitethernet?
895.370
Well, as you can see there are multiple options with just G, so you might think that’s too
901.930
short. However, here’s something cool. If you type the 0/0 after the G, it works! The
908.940
CLI will understand and bring you into interface configuration mode for gigabitethernet
913.940
0/0. So, whether you prefer to use shortcuts to maximize efficiency, or take your time
921.170
and type out the whole command, remember that the command to enter interface configuration
925.899
mode is ‘interface’, followed by the interface name.
931.190
Now that we’re in interface configuration mode, let’s set the IP address. That is
936.269
done with the command IP address, and then you type the IP address. Notice I used the
942.259
context-sensitive help, the question mark, to display the next option, and it is the
947.630
‘subnet mask’. This is another name for the ‘netmask’ I referred to in a previous
953.020
video. As opposed to writing /8 for this class A address, we will have to write out the subnet
959.930
mask in dotted decimal. For those of you who have heard of the term ‘subnet’ or ‘subnetting’
965.920
before, don’t worry. We’ll cover those topics in depth soon in separate videos. So,
972.819
you may remember /8 is equivalent to 255.0.0.0. /8 means that the first bits are all set
981.140
to 1, and a binary octet of all 1s is written as 255 in decimal. Next I enter the command
990.339
‘no shutdown’. This is the command we use to enable the interface. Remember I said
996.529
that Cisco router interfaces have the ‘shutdown’ command applied to them by default? Well,
1001.920
to cancel the command, type ‘no’ in front of the command like this. Now that we entered
1007.779
the no shutdown command on the interface, we get two messages on the device. The first
1013.540
one says ‘Interface gigabitethernet0/0, changed state to up. This refers to the physical
1021.149
layer status of the interface, the ‘STATUS’ column of the show ip interface brief command
1026.500
we looked at. The second message says ‘Line protocol on interface gigabitethernet0/0,
1033.140
changed state to up.’ This is the layer 2 status of the interface, the ‘protocol’
1039.230
column of the show ip interface brief command. So, now if we take a look at the show ip interface
1046.650
brief command, both of those columns should display up. Lets check. Here I use ‘do’
1054.159
to let me execute this privileged exec mode command from interface config mode, and notice
1059.270
I used shortcuts instead, SH ip INT BR, instead of show ip interface brief. As you can see,
1071.289
we can now see the IP address, the method is displayed as manual instead of unset, and
1077.770
both the status and protocol display up. Seems like our interface configuration was a success!
1084.750
Let’s do the configurations for the G0/1 interface next. I’ll give it an address
1090.850
of 172.16.255.254. The prefix length is /16, so what will the subnet mask be?
1101.390
So, I use the int g0/1 command to enter interface config mode for the interface. Notice that
1109.980
I didn’t type ‘exit’ to return to global config mode and then type int g0/1. You can
1117.030
directly switch from one interface to the other. Next I configure the IP address, using
1123.530
the shortcut ‘add’ for address. Notice the subnet mask of 255.255.0.0, which indicates
1131.659
a prefix length of /16. Then I enable the interface with ‘no shut’, which is a short
1138.870
version of the no shutdown command. Once again, I get two messages saying the interface has
1145.710
come up. Then I check the interfaces again with show ip interface brief, and you can
1152.360
see that gigabitethernet0/1 has an IP address, and its status is UP UP.
1159.110
Finally, let’s configure R1’s g0/2 interface with an IP address of 192.168.0.254. The prefix
1169.760
length is /24, so what do you think the subnet mask will be?
1174.890
So, I use ‘int g0/2’ to enter interface config mode for gigabitethernet 0/2. Then
1183.700
I configure an IP address of 192.168.0.254, and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, which
1194.340
is equivalent to a prefix length of /24. I enable the interface with ‘no shut’, and once
1201.861
again I get the two messages indicating the interface has come up, and then once more
1207.520
I check the status of the interfaces with show ip interface brief. Looks like all of
1213.360
the interfaces have been properly configured. Their IP addresses are displayed, their method
1219.100
column displays ‘manual’, since I manually configured their IP addresses, and their status
1224.910
and protocol columns show up and up. Before finishing, I want to introduce some more
1231.740
‘show’ commands that can be used to check out the interfaces on a Cisco device.
1238.240
First up is the ‘show interfaces’ command. You can enter just ‘show interfaces’,
1244.669
but it shows a lot of information for each interface, so I recommend specifying which
1249.659
interface you want to check, in this case I specified G0/0. This command shows primarily
1256.880
Layer 1 and Layer 2 information about the interface, but also some Layer 3. Gigabitethernet0/0
1264.690
is up, that means that Layer 1 is working. Line protocol is up, that refers to the Layer
1271.779
2 status of the interface. This line is like the status and protocol columns of the ‘show
1278.030
ip interface brief’ command. Hardware is 1GBE, meaning 1 gigabit ethernet, address
1286.179
is 0c1b.8444.f000. That’s the MAC address of this interface. Notice it says BIA, followed
1298.450
by the MAC address again. I mentioned in a previous video that the MAC address can also
1303.960
be called the burned in address. Well, thats what BIA stands for. Why is it listed twice?
1311.860
Well, BIA refers to the actual physical address of the interface. However, you can actually
1318.140
configure a different MAC address in the CLI, although usually you won’t configure a different
1323.610
MAC address. Internet address is 10.255.255.254/8. This is the IP address, of course. Feel free
1335.200
to take a look at the rest of this information if you want, but I’ll explain more of it
1339.490
in detail in a later video. It’s all detailed Layer 1 and Layer 2 information about the interface.
1347.690
Now let’s look at one more valuable command. ‘show interfaces description’. Well, as
1353.909
you can see it has status and protocol columns like the show ip interface brief command.
1360.100
But it also has this ‘description’ column. Interface descriptions are optional, but can
1365.820
be very helpful in identifying the purpose of each interface. Let’s quickly go back
1371.159
and configure descriptions on each of these interfaces.
1374.750
So, from global config mode I once again entered interface config mode for G0/0. The command
1382.480
to configure an interface description is simply ‘description’, followed by the description.
1388.040
Now, there aren’t any rules regarding how to describe your interfaces. I use hashtags
1394.820
to make the descriptions more noticeable, and then I indicate which device the interface
1399.659
is connected to. I do the same for G0/1 and G0/2, using ‘D E S C’ instead of the full
1408.640
description command. I then use the show interfaces description command again, and now you can
1415.350
see the description of each interface. Now, there are many more ‘show’ commands you
1420.919
can use to obtain information about a device’s interfaces. We’ll take a look at a few more
1426.920
throughout this course, but for now remember ‘show ip interface brief’, ‘show interfaces’,
1433.850
and ‘show interfaces description’.
1437.309
Now let’s review what we covered. This is the same slide I showed at the beginning of
1441.700
the video, but let’s go through and make sure we covered everything. We covered IPv4
1447.700
address classes, which we also covered in Part 1, but reviewed in this video. We talked
1453.690
about how to find the maximum number of hosts, network address, broadcast address, first
1460.191
usable address, and last usable address of a particular network. If you’re not sure
1465.880
about any of those, go back and listen to that part of the video once more before moving
1470.460
on to today’s quiz. Finally, I showed you how to configure IP addresses on Cisco devices,
1477.450
as well as some ‘show’ commands to gather information about interfaces.
1483.120
Now let’s go on to the quiz for today’s video. If you want further help remembering
1487.669
what you’ve studied, remember to download and use the Anki flashcards from the link
1492.019
in the description. For this quiz, I’ll focus on finding the maximum number of hosts,
1498.320
network address, broadcast address, and first and last usable addresses of a network.
1505.730
First up, question 1: PC1 has an IP address of 43.109.23.12/8. Find the following: The network address, the
1517.890
maximum number of hosts in the network, the network broadcast address, the first usable
1523.039
address of the network, and the last usable address of the network. Pause the video to
1528.230
find the answers. Okay, let’s check. The network address is 43.0.0.0, since
1539.799
only the first octet is the network portion. The maximum number of hosts is 16,777,214,
1550.140
which is 2 to the power of 24, because there are 24 host bits in the network, minus 2,
1556.500
for the network and broadcast addresses. The first usable address is 43.0.0.1, which is
1564.360
the network address plus 1, and then the last usable address is 43.255.255.254, which is
1572.960
the broadcast address minus 1. Let’s go to question 2.
1578.080
PC4 has an IP address of 129.221.23.13/16. Find the same five values. Pause the video
1589.120
to find the answer. Okay, so the network address is 129.221.0.0. The
1601.799
maximum number of hosts is 65,534, which is 2 to the power of 16, minus 2. The network
1610.600
broadcast address is 129.221.255.255. The first usable address is 129.221.0.1, and the
1621.780
last usable address is 129.221.255.254. Let’s go to question 3.
1630.450
