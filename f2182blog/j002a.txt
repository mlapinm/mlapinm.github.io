Welcome to Jeremy’s IT Lab.
3.216179
This is a free, complete course for the CCNA 200-301.
9.187778
In this video I will show you how to use the flashcards that are included in the description
of every video.
15.3529
We will be using the software ‘Anki’.
19.071419
Anki is an SRS, meaning spaced repetition software.
24.265763
An SRS uses an algorithm to determine when you should review each flashcard.
30.883021
The more times you answer correctly, the wider the interval between reviews gets, 
37.370781
so it
puts the information in your long-term memory, without wasting time reviewing every single
flashcard every day.
43.926833
Basically, it lets you choose what you want to remember, and if you design the flashcards
well 
50.221872
and do your reviews every day, you should be able to remember almost all of it.
54.86346
Flashcards have been extremely helpful in my studies.
59.116103
On my channel, I already have a video showing how I make flashcards, and I’ll include
a link in the description to that video.
67.588111
Although I’ll be providing pre-made flashcards for this course, 
71.603449
I also recommend you create
your own too if there is something else you want to remember, 
76.372421
or edit the cards I made to suit
your own style.
78.994961
Anyway lets get started.
81.164858
This here is the homepage for Anki, the software we’ll be using.
86.600486
Click download, and select your operating system.
90.892592
Once you’ve downloaded and installed Anki, you will see this screen.
95.370476
As you can see, there is one default deck here already.
100.218955
I recommend clicking create deck down here, and making a CCNA deck.
106.425151
I will be releasing a separate deck of flashcards for each video, 
111.325317
and rather than having tons
of separate decks, 
114.438206
I recommend you transfer the new cards to this central CCNA deck, 
118.744488
and
then delete the new, empty deck.
121.645789
I’ll show you how to do that in a second.
124.252341
So, back to the browser now.
127.728302
This here is the first video in my CCNA course, 
131.455251
and down here you can see the link to the
Anki flashcards for the video.
136.195754
Download it from google drive, and then go back to Anki.
142.085428
In the top left, click file, then import.
148.574365
Okay, now we have two decks, our central CCNA deck, and the cards we just downloaded.
157.373874
We want to transfer all of the new cards to our central CCNA deck.
162.403188
So, click on browse up here, then click on the 01networkdevices deck.
171.995144
Click edit up here, then select all.
176.2637
Then click cards, change deck.
180.013871
From here select the CCNA deck, and click move cards.
185.070429
Now exit, and you can see the cards have been moved to the CCNA deck.
190.47664
From here we can click on the gear icon, and delete the empty deck.
195.694619
Okay, now we’re ready to start studying.
199.523841
Click on the deck name, and then study now.
203.979191
Here is our first flashcard.
206.85354
Think about the answer, and then click show answer.
211.488428
If you answered correctly, click on good, and then the card will be shown again within
10 minutes.
218.939494
If you didn’t answer correctly, click again and the card will be shown again within 1
minute.
226.210353
You can also click easy, and the card’s review interval will jump ahead to four days.
232.840156
I’ll click good.
234.163886
And then you just continue that process until you’ve reviewed all 20 cards.
239.999211
I’ll just click through here...now, for new cards, you review them twice in the first
day.
249.620904
The first time, if you answer correctly, the card is shown again within 10 minutes.
255.330026
If you answer correctly the second time, the interval increases to 1 day.
260.518396
If you answer correctly again the next day, it will increase to 2 or 3 days later, 
266.283931
and then
5 or so days later, etc.
269.501397
If you answer incorrectly, however, the interval resets.
273.649499
If there are any cards you don’t think you need anymore, 
278.238553
you can delete them by clicking
more in the bottom right, and then delete note.
283.530243
I don’t recommend deleting many cards, though.
287.262699
If you want to edit a card, click on browse, and it will display the current card.
293.243215
You can edit it here.
295.145014
Finally, if you want to add new cards, just click on add.
300.535038
I do recommend creating your own flashcards, too.
304.035542
For example, if you are supplementing this video course with a book, 
308.461087
you can create flashcards
for what you learn from the book.
311.612025
Do all of your scheduled reviews each day, and it will greatly help you remember what
you’ve studied.
317.966734
I really think they will help set this course apart in terms of helping you learn the material
and pass your exam.
