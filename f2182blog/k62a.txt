lab we will troubleshoot PPP the

point-to-point protocol

I took the topology from the last lab

and added two more pairs of routers so

r1 and r3 are authenticated using pap

and r2 and r4 are authenticating using

chap however there is one miss

configuration on each of them which is

preventing PPP from working let's go one

by one and find the issues let's start

on r1 enable show interfaces s0 0 so the

correct encapsulation PPP is used

however the interface is up-down now r1

should have a username packet and a

password tracer configured which SP r1

will use to authenticate

let's check show run there it is so no

problems there now is r1 sending the

correct username Cisco and password CCNA

- SPR one looks like it isn't the PPP

PAP sent username password command isn't

configured let's go fix that compte

interface s0 0

shutdown PPP PAP sent a username cisco

password CCNA no shutdown do show IP

interface brief ok the interface is up

up let's try to ping SP r1 do ping 100

Oh Oh 1

okay looks like it works now so we've

solved the problem on our one now let's

check out our three which is also

configured to use PPP with PAP enable

show interfaces s0 0 again

correct encapsulation but the interface

is up down our three should have a user

named CCNA and a password CCENT

configure which SP our three will use to

authenticate let's check for that show

run there it is

is it sending the username Cisco and

password CCNP to SP r3 to authenticate

yes it is so what's the issue it's the

line right above here PPP authentication

chap r3 is supposed to be using PAP not

chap authentication coffee tea interface

s0 0

shut down no PPP authentication chap PPP

authentication PAP no shutdown do show

IP interface brief ok the interface is

up up let's try a ping to SPR 3 do ping

1 3000 won great it works next let's go

to our to enable show interfaces s0 0

same situation correct encapsulation PPP

but the interface isn't up r2 is

configured to use chap authentication so

it should have a user account configure

with the username SP r2 which is the

host of the router sorry the host name

of the router at the other end and a

password of CCNA which must be identical

to the password configured on SPR to

show run

username r2 password CCNA there's the

problem it's configured with its own

host name but it should be SPR to s host

name coffee tea no user name are two

passwords CCNA username SPR two password

CCNA now I'll go reset the interface

interface s00

shutdown no shutdown do show IP

interface brief okay it's up up now

let's try a ping do ping 200 0.1 okay

looks like r2 is working now finally

let's go to r4 enable show interfaces s0

0

encapsulation PPP is correct but the

interface is down like r2 r4 ship using

chap authentication so it should have a

username s PR for password CCIE

configured s PR for being the host name

of the other router it's connected to

show run ok that looks correct

let's check the interface configuration

ok we're missing something here the PPP

authentication chap statement is missing

coffee tea interface s 0 0 shutdown PPP

authentication chap no shutdown do show

IP interface brief ok it's up up now do

ping 1 4000 dot 1

okay it's working

I've pre-configured default routes to

the service provider on each router so

if I try to ping r2 r3 or r1 from our 4

it should work now let's try first I'll

ping r1 do ping 100 oh oh - ok it works

how about r3 do ping 1 3000 - it works

as well and let's try our to do ping 200

go - it works as well that's all for
