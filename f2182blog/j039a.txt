00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,010
Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,260
Also, remember to download this practice lab
from the link in the description and try it

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,830
out yourself in packet tracer.

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,240
If you want more labs like these, I highly
recommend picking up Boson’s NetSim for

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,190
the CCNA, click the link in the video description
to check it out.

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,250
It’s a network simulator like packet tracer,
but it’s even better, and it includes all

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,579
of these guided labs to not only help you
get hands-on practice configuring and troubleshooting,

13
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:48,450
but also deepen your understanding of the
exam topics.

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,070
I used it myself when studying for my certifications,
so I feel confident about recommending it

15
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,800
to all of you.

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,160
Watch until the end of this video, we’ll
take a look at a lab from NetSim.

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,070
If you want to get your own copy of NetSim,
please follow the link in the video description.

18
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,760
In this lab we will do some basic STP configurations.

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,310
STP runs by default, so you don’t actually
have to configure it, however if you just

20
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:19,340
leave it at the default settings there is
no guarantee that traffic will be following

21
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,549
the optimal path.

22
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:26,500
So, it’s a good idea to explicitly configure
which switch should be the root for each VLAN,

23
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,530
and also set different roots for different
VLANs so each VLAN uses different links, balancing

24
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,310
the load of the network traffic.

25
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:40,450
Step 1 in this video is to use the CLI to
check the current STP topology, identify the

26
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,080
root bridge, and the STP role and state of
each port on each switch.

27
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,799
I’ll start on SW1.

28
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,700
First let’s get into privileged exec mode.

29
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,799
ENABLE.

30
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,260
We only need one show command for this.

31
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,990
SHOW SPANNING-TREE.

32
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,280
Information is displayed separately for VLAN1
and VLAN2, however because I haven’t done

33
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,930
any configuration yet their settings will
be the same, the same root bridge and the

34
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:12,530
role of each port will be the same also, so let’s
just look at VLAN1.

35
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,700
SW1 is not the root bridge, notice the MAC
address is different in the Root ID section

36
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,299
and the Bridge ID section.

37
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:24,360
As for the port roles, you can see them here.

38
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,260
F0/3 is the root port, so I’m guessing SW2
is the root bridge.

39
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,669
Let’s go on SW2 now to check if that is
the case.

40
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:36,579
First enter privileged exec mode.

41
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:37,989
ENABLE.

42
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:40,599
SHOW SPANNING-TREE.

43
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:45,239
In the root ID section, it clearly states
‘this bridge is the root’.

44
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,849
You can also see that all of its interfaces
are designated ports, in a forwarding state.

45
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:54,299
This is the case for both VLAN1 and VLAN2.

46
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:59,449
Without any specific configuration, each VLAN
will have the same root, and the port roles

47
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:02,150
will be the same in each VLAN.

48
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,519
Next let’s go on SW3.

49
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,430
We know its not the root, but which port do
you think is the root port?

50
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,299
It should be F0/2, because it’s directly
connected, and all of these connections are

51
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:19,689
fastethernet, there are no gigabit ethernet
connections which have a lower cost.

52
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:21,299
ENABLE.

53
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:23,059
SHOW SPANNING-TREE.

54
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:28,560
Indeed, F0/2 is the root port, and F0/1 is
designated.

55
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,720
Finally, let’s check SW4.

56
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,729
Its F0/1 interface should be the root port.

57
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:38,529
ENABLE.

58
00:03:38,529 --> 00:03:41,010
SHOW SPANNING-TREE.

59
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:46,890
As expected, F0/1 is the root port, also F0/2
is blocking.

60
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:52,909
The role says ‘alternate’, this means
a non-designated port.

61
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:59,219
Step 2 is to configure load balancing by making
SW1 the primary root for VLAN1 and secondary

62
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,680
root for VLAN2, and the opposite on SW2.

63
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,530
Let’s return to SW1.

64
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:14,329
Go to global config mode, CONF T. Let’s
configure it as the root for VLAN1.

65
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:18,340
SPANNING-TREE VLAN 1 ROOT PRIMARY.

66
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,990
Remember to include the VLAN in the command,
in Cisco’s PVST+ all configurations are

67
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,100
done on a per-VLAN basis.

68
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,720
Next, the secondary root for VLAN2.

69
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,800
SPANNING-TREE VLAN 2 ROOT SECONDARY.

70
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:44,889
Now I’ll hop on to SW2.  CONF T. SPANNING-TREE
VLAN 1 ROOT SECONDARY.

71
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:47,250
SPANNING-TREE VLAN 2 ROOT PRIMARY.

72
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,389
Okay, that’s it.

73
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:53,620
So, what is the STP role and state of each
port now?

74
00:04:53,620 --> 00:05:01,789
Well, here on SW2, in VLAN2 all ports should
be designated, but now on SW1 F0/3 should

75
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:06,389
be the root port, because it’s directly
connected to the new root SW1.

76
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,870
Let’s check.

77
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,150
DO SHOW SPANNING-TREE.

78
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:22,139
So, for VLAN2 it is still the root, but for
VLAN1 F0/3 is now the root port, as expected.

79
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:25,900
The other ports are designated ports in a
forwarding state.

80
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,050
Let’s go back and check on SW1.

81
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:36,190
In VLAN1 all ports should be designated, but
in VLAN2 F0/3 should still be the root port,

82
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,150
like before.

83
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,110
DO SHOW SPANNING-TREE.

84
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:48,460
So, indeed in VLAN2 F0/3 is the root port,
F0/1 and F0/2 are designated.

85
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:55,889
In VLAN1 however SW1 is now the root bridge,
so all ports are designated.

86
00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:02,689
In step 3 and step 4 we are going to manipulate
a couple STP port settings and see the effects.

87
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:09,500
First up, we will increase the cost of SW4’s
F0/2 interface to 100 in VLAN1, and see if

88
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,690
it selects a different root port.

89
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:17,460
First, let’s confirm that the current root
port is F0/2, it should be for VLAN 1.

90
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,229
Let’s view the spanning tree for VLAN1 only.

91
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:25,630
SHOW SPANNING-TREE VLAN 1.

92
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:33,070
Okay, as expected F0/2 is the root port, it
has the lowest cost to SW1, the root.

93
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,590
Let’s change that cost.

94
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,699
Before doing so, what do you think will happen?

95
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:41,530
What is the first criteria in selecting the
root port?

96
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:47,849
It’s the cost, so increasing the cost to
over 5 times the current cost should cause

97
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:50,430
SW4 to select a different root port.

98
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,330
Let’s try.

99
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:59,259
The configuration is done from interface config
mode, so INTERFACE F0/2.

100
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:03,319
SPANNING-TREE VLAN 1 COST 100.

101
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,080
Now let’s view the spanning-tree just for
VLAN 1 again.

102
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,490
DO SHOW SPANNING-TREE VLAN 1.

103
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:17,139
Okay, as expected F0/2 is no longer the root
port, it has changed to a blocking state,

104
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:21,389
and now F0/1 is the root port.

105
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:26,889
For step 4 we will increase the priority
of SW1’s F0/1 to 240, the highest possible

106
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:32,800
priority number, however in STP a lower number
is actually treated with higher priority,

107
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,430
so really we are lowering the priority to
240, even though the number itself is greater.

108
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,530
Will this effect SW3’s selection of a root
port?

109
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:48,539
First up, let’s check SW3’s root port
for VLAN1, it should be F0/1.

110
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:52,150
Let’s just view VLAN1.

111
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,180
DO SHOW SPANNING-TREE VLAN 1.

112
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,580
Indeed, F0/1 is the root port.

113
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:05,810
Now, if we set the priority of SW1’s F0/1
port to 240, will this affect SW3’s root

114
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,309
port selection?

115
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:08,729
What do you think?

116
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:11,539
Actually, it shouldn’t.

117
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:18,389
Sender port ID is actually the last tiebreaker,
after port cost and sender bridge ID.

118
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:25,639
Because F0/1 has a lower root cost than F0/2,
19 versus 38, the port priority should have

119
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,740
no effect.

120
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,229
Let’s go configure that port priority on
SW1.

121
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:36,750
Enter interface config mode, INTERFACE F0/1.

122
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,849
SPANNING-TREE VLAN 1 PORT-PRIORITY 240.

123
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:45,580
First up let’s view that priority here on
SW1.

124
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,020
DO SHOW SPANNING-TREE VLAN 1.

125
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:57,340
Here for interface F0/1 you can see the priority
dot number column, this is the port ID, and

126
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,589
the priority has increased to 240.

127
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:04,480
Now let’s check on SW3.

128
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,220
Use the up arrow to return to the previous
command and hit enter.

129
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:14,380
As expected, there is no change, F0/1 is still
the root port.

130
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:20,139
Finally, let’s configure PortFast and BPDU
Guard.

131
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:23,269
Before doing so, let’s test portfast.

132
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:30,810
I will turn on link lights for this, click
options, preferences, and then show link lights

133
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,070
here.

134
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:37,870
Next, let me delete the connection between
SW3 and PC1.

135
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:44,790
Now I will connect them again, PC1 to SW3’s
F0/3 interface.

136
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:50,420
After reconnecting the two devices, SW3’s
F0/3 interface has to go through the STP listening

137
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,589
and learning states before it can forward
traffic again, so the link light will remain

138
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:58,100
orange for about 30 seconds.

139
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:05,130
Let’s go on the CLI and configure both
portfast and BPDU guard on F0/3.

140
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,040
INTERFACE F0/3.

141
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,370
SPANNING-TREE PORTFAST.

142
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,589
SPANNING-TREE BPDUGUARD ENABLE.

143
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:19,029
Okay, that’s it, pretty simple configurations.

144
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:24,360
Now that portfast is enabled, I will delete
that connection once more, and now let’s

145
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,269
reconnect them again, PC1 to SW3’s F0/3.

146
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:33,910
Notice that it moves immediately to forwarding,
the link light is green right away.

147
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:40,790
Now, because BPDU guard is enabled, if we
connect F0/3 to another switch and a BPDU

148
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,220
is received, the interface should be shut
down.

149
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,440
Let’s try that.

150
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,530
I’ll delete the connection once more, and
this time let’s use a crossover cable to

151
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,600
connect F0/3 to SW4.

152
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,980
When SW3 receives a BPDU from SW4 on its F0/3
interface, the interface is shutdown to avoid

153
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,709
a loop, and now the link light is red.

154
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:08,250
Let’s delete that connection again, and
use a regular straight through cable to connect

155
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,769
to PC1.

156
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:16,610
Now let’s return to the CLI, and to enable
this interface that was disabled by BPDU guard,

157
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,509
I will SHUTDOWN, and then NO SHUTDOWN the
interface.

158
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:25,420
Okay, now F0/3 is back up and running.

159
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:33,380
Okay, since we finished our experiment I’ll
just configure the same on SW4.

160
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,730
INTERFACE F0/3.

161
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,600
SPANNING-TREE PORTFAST.

162
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,620
SPANNING-TREE BPDUGUARD ENABLE.

163
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,230
Okay, that’s all for this lab.

164
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,620
Next up let’s take a look at a lab in Boson
NetSim.

165
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:55,019
Okay, for today's Boson NetSim lab preview,
we are once again doing a lab from NetSim

166
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,550
for ENCOR.

167
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,060
This is a CCNP-level lab.

168
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:05,170
The reason for that is spanning tree configuration
isn't actually in the CCNA exam topics list,

169
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,360
so it's not included in Boson NetSim for CCNA.

170
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,579
However I want to show you a lab anyway, so
let's do a CCNP-level lab.

171
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:19,910
The one we're going to look at is Spanning
Tree Protocol PVST Load Balancing.

172
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,830
So you click on the lab here, and then click
on 'load lab'.

173
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,070
But I've already done that.

174
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,600
So this is the lab.

175
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,810
Create a VTP management domain for distribution
of VLANs to all switches, and configure a

176
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:38,250
primary and secondary root bridge for the
VLANs in the network.

177
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,850
So this is definitely a CCNP-level lab.

178
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:46,850
It's quite challenging, quite extensive, and
it's not just about configuration, but Boson

179
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,850
asks you a lot of really good questions to
test your understanding of spanning tree protocol.

180
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,220
And I think I've said it before, but that's
something I really like about NetSim.

181
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,860
It's not all about the configuration, it really
does test your understanding and help get

182
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,100
you...help you get ready for the exam.

183
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,399
So these are commands you need to know.

184
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,270
Although this is a CCNP-level exam (*lab),
these are actually all commands you already

185
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,339
know.

186
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:17,949
SHOW SPANNING-TREE, SHOW VLAN, SPANNING-TREE
VLAN ROOT, SPANNING-TREE VLAN PRIORITY, SWITCHPORT

187
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:20,900
MODE, ENCAPSULATION DOT1Q.

188
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,010
So these are all commands you already know.

189
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,830
So although this lab might be a challenge,
I think it actually is doable for someone

190
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,490
studying for their CCNA.

191
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,910
So, I'm not actually gonna do the configurations
in this demonstration, I just want to walk

192
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:40,149
through the lab and see what kind of tasks
you're asked to do.

193
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:43,310
Task 1 is perform the initial configurations.

194
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,440
So these aren't actually spanning-tree configurations.

195
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:54,779
These are trunk configurations, VTP configurations,
and VLAN configurations.

196
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,250
So that's something I really like about this
lab, it's not focused entirely on spanning

197
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,340
tree.

198
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,149
It helps you review other topics you've studied.

199
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:07,949
Okay, plan primary and secondary root bridge
configuration.

200
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:13,290
So in task 2 you're not actually doing any
configuration, you're examining the network,

201
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:18,090
answering some questions, thinking about what
configurations you're going to do, before

202
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:22,390
you actually implement and verify the configurations
in task 3.

203
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:25,839
So what kind of questions are you asked?

204
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,020
For example number 1, how is the information
provided by the network engineer useful?

205
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,100
So that is in this explanation here.

206
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,430
Your network engineer has determined that
VLANs 1 though 3 represent half of the traffic

207
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:43,629
and VLANs 4 through 6 represent the other
half, so how is this information useful to

208
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:44,629
you?

209
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:49,769
And if you don't know how to answer one of
these questions, if you look at the lab solutions

210
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:53,190
you can find Boson's explanation.

211
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,269
Here is task 2.

212
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:01,260
So these are Boson's answers to those questions.

213
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,640
Okay, task 3 is actually implement and verify
the configurations.

214
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:10,670
So, configure the primary and secondary root
bridge for different VLANs to ensure load

215
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,889
balancing.

216
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:18,959
And task 4, this is something you're not gonna
find on most practice labs, certainly not

217
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,410
my practice labs.

218
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,790
'Document the network'.

219
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:27,680
Look at these questions, how many root ports
can each non-root bridge have per STP instance?

220
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,220
How many designated ports can a non-root switch
have?

221
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,709
And then here, this one I really like.

222
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:33,890
Start to document the network.

223
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:40,189
So, you're going to have to use SHOW commands
to find the bridge ID, root bridge ID, root

224
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:45,280
port, and path cost to root of each of these
switches.

225
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,820
And then here, use the network diagrams below
to document the root bridge, root ports, designated

226
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,949
ports, alternate ports, and blocked ports.

227
00:15:52,949 --> 00:16:03,000
And then question 5, what path will a VLAN
1 packet take from ASW1 to R2 via CSW2?

228
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,389
So again, these are just really good questions
to really test your understanding of spanning

229
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:08,100
tree protocol.

230
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,840
And if you ever have problems answering these
questions, once again just look at the lab

231
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:18,350
solutions and you can find Boson's explanations
here.

232
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:24,040
For example, these are all the blocking ports
and such in these network topologies here,

233
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,010
from question 4.

234
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:31,290
Okay, so if you want to get a copy of NetSim,
and I highly recommend you do, as you can

235
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,600
see these are really great, in-depth practice
labs that not only test your knowledge of

236
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:42,500
the show commands, the configuration commands,
but your knowledge of the topics as a whole.
