welcome to this free gns3 practice lab

for the CCNA that's right in this video

as well as the next one I will be using

gns3 not packet tracer as much as I love

packet tracer even today it doesn't

support everything that is on the CCNA

exam topics so for this video on

multi-link PPP and the next video on

pppoe I had to choose between skipping

the topics or using gns3 instead I will

still put the lab file in the

description which you can use to load up

the topology these routers are cisco c

7200 routers however I can't legally

include the iOS image files so you'll

have to get those yourself I'll put the

name of the iOS image I used in the

description if you want to know how to

get gns3 working do a quick search on

google there are plenty of people who

can teach you how to get gns3 up and

running now if you just can't get gns3

working make sure you watch the video

and learn the commands as these topics

are on the exam topics list let's get

started in this lab we will configure

multi-link PPP or ml PPP much like ether

channel which we configured a few labs

ago ml PPP groups multiple physical

interfaces together to operate as one

logical interface this provides multiple

benefits you get the redundancy of

having multiple links so if one link

fails the others can keep forwarding

traffic however you also get the

increased bandwidth of having multiple

links forwarding at the same time so in

this lab we will configure multi-link

PPP with PAP authentication between r1

and SPR 1 and chap authentication

between r2 and SPR - I'll go on r1 first

compte

now SP r1 is currently configured for ml

PPP with pap authentication and is

trying to authenticate with the username

packet and password tracer so let's

configure that user account on our one

username packet password tracer okay now

to configure ml PPP let's first create

the logical interface which is called

multi link interface

multi-link one okay there are a few

commands we need to put here the first

is PPP multi link that is followed by

PPP multi-link group one we will put

that command on the physical interfaces

two later to tell them to join this

multi link group keep in mind this multi

link group number and the multi link

interface number have to be the same as

on the neighboring router next let's

activate PAP authentication PPP

authentication tap the network diagram

says to send a username of Cisco and

password of CCNA PPP PAP sent username

cisco password CCNA finally we have to

configure the IP address here not on the

physical interfaces IP address 100 0 to

255 255 dot 255 dot 255 in interface

multi-link 1 the order is different but

there's everything I configured IP

address PAP authentication and PPP

multi-link configuration ok now let's

configure the two physical interfaces to

join this multi link group interface s1

zero there are just three commands I

need here we have to set the

encapsulation on the physical interfaces

to PPP so encapsulation PPP next tell it

had joined the multi link group we

created PPP multi-link group one finally

make sure the physical interfaces aren't

shutdown no shutdown okay now I'll do

the same on s1 one interface s1 1

encapsulation PPP PPP multi-link group 1

no shutdown end ok let's do some show

commands to verify first a general PPP

show command show PPP all notice our two

physical interfaces as well as the multi

link interface all with the same peer

address of 101 which is the address of

SPR 1 also the peer name of packet which

SPR 1 is using to authenticate next show

PPP multi-link there's the remote user

name of packet again and our local user

name of cisco dan here you can see our

two member links serial 1 0 and 1 1 ok

let's try a ping to see if it works

ping 100 0 1 there we go

ok let's move on to our to the

multi-link configuration will be the

same just with chap authentication

instead of PAP coffee tea first I'll

create the user account that SP r2 will

use to authenticate remember the

username should be the same as the

remote routers hostname so username SPR

2 and then the password should be the

same on both route

in this case password CCNA interface

multi-link 1 PPP multi-link PPP

multi-link group 1 PPP authentication

chap

and finally the IP address IP address

200 0 to 255 255 dot 255 dot 255 in

there's the IP address followed by chap

authentication and our multi-link

configuration looks good next we just

have to prepare the physical interfaces

interface s10 encapsulation PPP PPP

multi-link group 1 no shutdown interface

s1 1 encapsulation PPP PPP multi-link

group 1 no shutdown and ok let's confirm

show PPP all again our physical

interfaces as well as the multi link

interface all have the same peer address

200 0 0 1 and that peers name is spr to

show PPP multi-link the remote user name

of SPR 2 again our local user name of r2

and down here the two member links

serial 1 0 and 1 1 let's try to ping SPR

to ping 201 ok no problems here

now let's configure static default

routes on our routers so that they can

reach each other via the service

provider network here on r2 first compte

IP route

oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh and the next

hop is 201 do show IP route

there's our default route 200 g o / o

next let's configure it on our one

coughed e IP route

oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh the next hop

is 101 do show IP rent there's the

default route let's try a ping to r2

from r1 do ping 200 go to great looks

like our multi-link PPP configuration is

working that's all for this lab thank
