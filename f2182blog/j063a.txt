in packet tracer.

6
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,589
If you want more labs like these, I highly
recommend picking up Boson’s NetSim for

7
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:35,980
the CCNA, click the link in the video description
to check it out. It’s a network simulator

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,559
like packet tracer, but it’s even better,
and it includes all of these guided labs to

9
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,059
not only help you get hands-on practice configuring
and troubleshooting, but also deepen your

10
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:50,960
understanding of the exam topics. I used it
myself when studying for my certifications,

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,809
so I feel confident about recommending it
to all of you. If you want to get your own

12
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,390
copy of NetSim, please follow the link in
the video description.

13
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:04,710
In today’s video we’ll practice configuring
IPv6 static routes in this network to enable

14
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:11,140
PC1 and PC2 to ping each other via the R1,
R3 path, and also configure a backup route

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:17,619
via R2. The IPv6 addresses on the routers
have been preconfigured, but not the PCs,

16
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:23,150
so we are going to use SLAAC to configure
IPv6 addresses on the PCs.

17
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:29,399
Before that, we must enable IPv6 routing on
each router. If IPv6 routing isn’t enabled,

18
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:34,131
these routers won’t route IPv6 traffic,
and they also won’t send the NDP router

19
00:01:34,131 --> 00:01:39,360
advertisement messages that are necessary
for SLAAC to work. So let’s quickly enable

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,609
that on each router, R1 first.

21
00:01:44,609 --> 00:02:00,799
ENABLE. CONF T. IPV6 UNICAST-ROUTING. Next
R2. ENABLE. CONF T. IPV6 UNICAST-ROUTING.

22
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:08,560
Finally R3. ENABLE. CONF T. IPV6 UNICAST-ROUTING.

23
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:16,690
Okay, always remember that step when configuring
IPv6. Now I’ll go on PC1. From the config

24
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:22,690
tab, I’ll set the default gateway by clicking
on ‘automatic’. As you can see, PC1 automatically

25
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:29,390
set its default gateway. This is a link-local
IPv6 address, so it must be R1’s address.

26
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:36,480
It learned it from R1’s NDP router advertisement
messages. Next I’ll select PC1’s FastEthernet0

27
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,640
interface, and you can see packet tracer automatically
enabled SLAAC for PC1 and it configured an

28
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,760
IPv6 address. It learned this network prefix
from R1, and the second half, the interface

29
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:57,480
ID, was generated using EUI-64. Okay, let’s
do the same on PC2. From the config tab, tell

30
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:04,130
PC2 to automatically learn its default gateway.
There it is, and let’s look at its FastEthernet0

31
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:09,590
interface. As you can see, it automatically
learned the network prefix from R3 and also

32
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:17,010
used EUI-64 to generate an interface ID. Later,
when I try a ping from PC1 to PC2, I’m going

33
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,960
to need to copy this address, but I can’t
highlight it here. So, I’ll go to the CLI

34
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:29,840
of PC2, and use the command IPCONFIG to view
PC2’s IPv6 address here. Okay, I’ll copy

35
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,150
this address later when I try to ping from
PC1 to PC2.

36
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:40,450
Okay, now let’s get to the main part of
this lab, configuring IPv6 static routes.

37
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:46,140
We need to configure routes to allow PC1 and
PC2 to ping each other. The path from R1 to

38
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,060
R3 should be the main path, and the serial
connections to R2 should only be used as a

39
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,680
backup. So let’s configure routes on R1
first.

40
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,590
So R1 needs two routes to R3’s internal
LAN, the main route directly to R3 and a backup

41
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:13,700
route to R2. Let’s configure the main route.
IPV6 ROUTE 2001:db8:0:3::/64, that’s the

42
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:21,180
destination, now we can enter either the next
hop, or both the exit interface and next hop.

43
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,219
As I said in the lecture video, on an Ethernet
interface you can’t use just the exit interface,

44
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:32,060
a directly attached static route. You can
only use recursive or fully-specified static

45
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:42,356
routes. I’ll use fully specified routes.
G0/1 2001:db8:0:13::2.

46
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:49,139
Okay, that’s the main route. Now our backup
route via R2. I only enabled IPv6 on the serial

47
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:54,169
interfaces, I didn’t manually configure
any IPv6 addresses, so the routers only have

48
00:04:54,169 --> 00:05:00,389
link-local addresses. So, I need to know R2’s
link-local address to use as the next hop.

49
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:10,469
I’ll go on R2. DO SHOW IPV6 INTERFACE BRIEF.
Okay, there’s the link-local address of

50
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:20,810
serial0/0/0, I’ll copy it, and return to
R1. Now I’ll use the up arrow, delete the

51
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:28,210
interface and next hop, and now the exit interface
is s0/0/0, and I’ll paste R2’s link-local

52
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:34,240
address as the next hop. Remember, when using
a link-local address as the next hop you have

53
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,500
to use a fully specified route, you have to
include the exit-interface, too. But this

54
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,659
route isn’t complete yet, we want to make
sure this is only used as a backup. How can

55
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:50,930
we do that? We can configure it as a floating
static route. So, I will specify the administrative

56
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:57,969
distance here, let’s make it 5. In Cisco
IOS a normal static route has an AD of 1,

57
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:03,909
so we just need to make the AD higher than
1. Okay, let’s check the routing table.

58
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:10,300
DO SHOW IPV6 ROUTE. Okay, so you can only
see the route via R3, but let’s check the

59
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:18,889
running config to make sure R1 has that floating
static route. DO SHOW RUN, pipe, INCLUDE IPV6

60
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:25,009
ROUTE. Notice I used the pipe with INCLUDE
to filter it only to lines that include IPV6

61
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:31,419
ROUTE. Okay, now we can see both of the routes.
That’s all for R1. Now, I’m going to configure

62
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:38,220
R2’s routes next, so let me get the link-local
address of R1’s s0/0/0 interface first.

63
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:45,460
DO SHOW IPV6 INTERFACE BRIEF. Okay, I’ll
copy that to use as the next hop for R2.

64
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:54,990
So, let’s go back to R2. R2 needs a route
to R1’s LAN and a route to R3’s LAN. I’ll

65
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:05,669
configure the route to R1’s LAN first. IPV6
ROUTE 2001:db8:0:1::/64 S0/0/0, and now I’ll

66
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:12,490
paste R1’s link-local address. Okay, next
up is the route to R3’s LAN. First I’ll

67
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:20,889
go on R3 and get the link-local address of
its S0/0/0 interface. DO SHOW IPV6 INTERFACE

68
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:27,550
BRIEF. There it is, let me copy that. Now
I’ll go back to R2 and configure the route.

69
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:38,129
IPV6 ROUTE 2001:db8:0:3::/64 s0/0/1, and I’ll
paste in R3’s link-local address as the

70
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:46,729
next hop. Let’s check R2’s routing table.
DO SHOW IPV6 ROUTE. Okay, it’s got the two

71
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:52,659
static routes we just configured, that’s
all for R2. But before going to R3, let’s

72
00:07:52,659 --> 00:08:00,810
get the link-local address of R2’s S0/0/1
interface. DO SHOW IPV6 INTERFACE BRIEF. Okay,

73
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,560
I’ll copy that address.

74
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:10,009
Finally, let’s configure R3’s routes.
First I’ll configure the main route via

75
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:25,219
R1. IPV6 ROUTE 2001:db8:0:1::/64 G0/1 2001:db8:0:13::1.
Note that you don’t have to use fully specified

76
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:31,990
routes like I do, you can use just the next
hop. Okay, now the backup route via R2. I’ll

77
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:39,211
use the up arrow, delete the interface and
next hop, and now the interface will be S0/0/0,

78
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:46,130
I’ll paste in R2’s link-local address,
and finally set the AD to 5. Okay, that’s

79
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:51,350
everything, PC1 should be able to ping PC2,
and there is a backup route incase the link

80
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,610
between R1 and R3 fails.

81
00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:04,790
Let’s try that ping. I’ll go to PC2 first
to copy its IP address. Next I’ll go on

82
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:14,930
to the CLI of PC1, and let’s try that ping
to PC2. PING, and I’ll paste in PC2’s

83
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:21,710
IP address. Okay, PC1 is able to ping PC2.
Let’s try a traceroute to see which path

84
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:27,440
it is taking. On a windows PC the command
is TRACERT, but if you’re doing this command

85
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,040
on a Cisco device you’ll have to type it
out fully like this, TRACEROUTE. These packet

86
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:40,880
tracer PCs are like windows PCs, so its just
TRACERT, and again I’ll paste PC2’s address.

87
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:49,220
Okay, it goes to the default gateway, then
13::2, which is R3, and then the destination.

88
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay, let’s unplug that cable between R1
and R3. To delete the cable, click this icon

89
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,320
in packet tracer, then click the cable. Okay,
now it’s deleted. Let’s try that ping

90
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:11,090
again from PC1. I’ll use the up arrow, and
let’s try it. Okay, it works. How about

91
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:19,240
a traceroute? As you can see, the traceroute
is having trouble at the second hop, at R2.

92
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,880
That’s because R2 only has link-local addresses,
which aren’t routable. But if we wait a

93
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,040
bit we see a reply from R3, and then the destination
PC2. Don’t worry about that, the ping is

94
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,940
still working, and the PCs have no problems
reaching each other. It’s no problem if

95
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:41,750
PC1 can’t reach every single router in the
path to the destination. Okay, in this lab

96
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,440
we configured IPv6 static routes. That’s
all for this lab.

97
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:53,641
Okay, here's today's Boson NetSim practice
lab. This lab is configuring IPv6 2. Here's

98
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:59,930
the objective. Configure a simulated network
with IPv6 addresses on physical interfaces

99
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:05,670
and loopback interfaces. Your implementation
should enable router interfaces to ping IPv6

100
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:13,220
addresses across routers and across IPv6 subnets.
And you will configure IPv6 addressing and

101
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:20,620
Routing Information Protocol, RIP, for IPv6.
So, you will configure RIP for IPv6 in this

102
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:26,140
lab. As I have said before, dynamic routing
protocols for IPv6 aren't actually part of

103
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,940
the CCNA exam topics list. But the configuration
is actually quite simple, so let's give it

104
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,950
a try. And you can check down here in the
command summary, which commands you need to

105
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:45,540
know to complete this lab. Okay, here are
the lab tasks. Task 1, configure IPv6 addresses.

106
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:52,520
Task 2, enable IPv6 RIP routing, and Task
3 configure IPv6 between Router1 and Router3.

107
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:58,590
So, for this lab demonstration I actually
completed Task 1, I configured IPv6 addresses

108
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:06,680
on Router3 and Router4. I configured 2 loopback
interfaces, as you can see here in the CLI

109
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:17,860
of Router3, loopback6, I configured IPv6 addresses.
And same on Router4, loopback6, IPv6 addresses.

110
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:24,190
So finally, just this last step in task 1,
step 10. From Router4, try to ping Router3's

111
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:36,752
global unicast serial 0/1 IPv6 address. So,
that should work, let's try. PING 2001:1:3:1::1.

112
00:12:36,752 --> 00:12:43,810
Oh, I am in interface configuration mode.
I'll just exit out of there and try that once

113
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:52,470
again. Okay, the ping works. And then it says
to try to ping Router3's global unicast loopback6

114
00:12:52,470 --> 00:13:01,580
IPv6 address. So let's try that. I'll change
this to a 2. And the ping is not working.

115
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:08,530
So, why is that? Router4 can ping the directly
connected interface here, but not the loopback

116
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:14,800
interface in Router3. And the answer as to
why that is is pretty simple. SHOW IPV6 ROUTE

117
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:23,190
here on Router4. And there is no route to
the 2001:1:3:2 network which Router3's loopback

118
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:29,100
interface is in. So Router4 simply doesn't
know about that network. So we could configure

119
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:35,130
a static route on Router4 and then a static
route on Router3 to Router4's loopback interface.

120
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:41,880
But in this lab we are not going to do that,
we are going to use RIPng, RIP next generation.

121
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:48,030
So let's go on to Task 2. On Router3 and Router4,
globally enable RIP for IPv6. Name the process

122
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:55,630
boson. So we haven't covered RIPng configuration
in the course yet, and we won't because it's

123
00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:01,700
not actually in the exam topics list, but
you can check how to do that here. IPV6 ROUTER

124
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:12,370
RIP process-name. So it said to use a process
name of boson. IPV6 ROUTER RIP boson. Okay,

125
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:24,780
and then Router3. IPV6 ROUTER RIP boson. Okay,
that's it. Let me just check, DO SHOW IPV6

126
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:34,730
PROTOCOLS. Okay, IPv6 routing protocol is
'rip boson'. That doesn't mean 'rest in peace

127
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:43,150
boson', by the way, Boson is alive and well.
Okay, step 2. Issue the SHOW IPV6 ROUTE command

128
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:52,500
on Router3. What RIP routes are being advertised?
Why? Okay, DO SHOW IPV6 ROUTE. Okay, I don't

129
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:59,770
see any RIP routes. Why is that? Well that's
because Router4 and also on Router3, we haven't

130
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:06,060
enabled RIPng directly on the interfaces yet.
We've enabled RIP, the RIP process, on the

131
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:12,360
router, but it's still not activated on any
interfaces. Okay, on Router4 try to ping the

132
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:19,370
IPv6 address on Router3's loopback6 interface.
Okay, I'll try that but I can tell you now

133
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:28,510
that the ping will not succeed. And indeed
it does not because Router3 isn't advertising

134
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:36,780
any RIP routes yet. Okay, so now we are going
to enable RIP on the interfaces. So you can

135
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:43,840
see the command, how to do that up here. IPV6
RIP process-name ENABLE, on the interface.

136
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:57,590
So, on Router4 that is serial0/0 first. IPV6
RIP boson ENABLE. Okay, that was it. And then

137
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:07,320
the loopback6 interface. IPV6 RIP boson ENABLE.
Okay that's all for R4. Now let's do it on

138
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:23,360
R3. INTERFACE S0/1. IPv6 RIP boson ENABLE.
And on loopback6. Okay, that should be it.

139
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,210
Let's go back to task 2. Allow time for the
network to converge. So RIP can be kind of

140
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:33,711
slow, so we gotta wait for them to learn the
routes. And then issue the SHOW IPV6 ROUTE

141
00:16:33,711 --> 00:16:40,380
command on Router3. Do you see a route from
Router3 to Router4's loopback6 interface?

142
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:48,550
Hopefully that was enough time, let's check.
DO SHOW IPV6 ROUTE. And yes, this should be

143
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:56,910
Router4's loopback6 interface. On Router4,
attempt to ping Router3's loopback interface.

144
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:07,589
Okay let's try that. DO PING 2001:1:3:2::1.
Okay, and the ping works. So that means Router4

145
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:18,750
also has a route to Router3's loopback interface.
And here it is. Right there. Okay, on Router3

146
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,439
issue the SHOW IPV6 PROTOCOLS command. You
should note that Router3 is sending and receiving

147
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,740
updates on the serial0/1 interface by using
the 'rip boson' process. Okay, we saw that

148
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:38,120
command earlier but let's check it again now.
IPv6 routing protocol is rip boson, and there

149
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:45,460
it is. Note that the loopback6 interface isn't
displayed, just the serial interface. Okay,

150
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:53,259
so in task 3 you would go on to configure
IPv6 here between Router1 and Router3, but

151
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:57,509
for today's lab demonstration we'll leave
it here. So, if you want to get a copy of
