Thanks for your help.

Let’s get started.

In this lab you will use what you learned in Day 2’s lecture video to connect these
network devices together.

You can select various types of connections from the bottom left here.

We’ll be using copper straight-through, copper cross-over, and fiber connections.

Note that packet tracer doesn’t differentiate between single-mode and multimode fiber, but
try to think about which type would be appropriate when you use a fiber connection.

So, I’ll start here in the bottom left.

First, the connection between SW3 and PC1.

For the purpose of this lab, we’re assuming that Auto MDI-X is disabled or not supported
on the devices, so we have to think about whether to use a straight-through or cross-over
copper cable.

PCs transmit data on pins 1 and 2, and receive data on pins 3 and 6.

Switches are the opposite, they transmit data on pins 3 and 6 and receive data on pins 1
and 2.

So, we can use a straight-through cable to connect all of these PCs, as well as SRV1,
to the switches.

Select straight-through cable here, and connect the PCs to their appropriate switch.

PC1 to SW3.
.
connect the fastethernet0 interface on the PC, which is the PC’s network interface
card, to any of the fastethernet interfaces on the switch.

Next is PC2 to SW4.
.
.
PC3 to SW7.
.
.
and SRV1 to SW8.

Now we’ve got a bunch of switches to connect together.

Devices of the same type require crossover cables, or else the transmit pins will be
connected to the transmit pins, and the receive pins will be connected to the receive pins,
which will not allow data to be sent successfully between the devices.

So, let’s connect these switches, SW3 to SW1.
.
.
SW1 to SW2.
.
.
SW4 to SW2.
.
.
SW7 to SW5.
.
.

SW5 to SW6.
.
.
and last SW8 to SW6.

Next let’s connect these switches to the routers.

Routers are like PCs, they transmit on pins 1 and 2 and receive on pins 3 and 6.

So let’s connect them to the switches with straight-through cables.

SW1 to R2.
.
.
SW2 to R2.
.
.
SW5 to R4.
.
.
and SW6 to R4.

Now it’s time to connect the routers.

Since they are the same device type, we need to use crossover cables if we use copper cabling.

Take care to look at the distances here.

Since R1 and R2 are just 50 meters apart, we can use copper cabling, which permits distances
up to 100 meters.

So I’ll connect R2 to R1 with a crossover cable.
 R1 and R3 are 3 kilometers apart,
so clearly we will have to use a fiber-optic connection here.

Although packet tracer doesnt differentiate between single-mode and multimode, which is
appropriate here?
Well, mutli mode fiber allows distances up to 550 meters, which is more than UTP, but
not enough for this connection.

Single-mode allows much longer distances, 30 kilometers, 40 kilometers, even more, so
in this case we would use single-mode fiber.

Let’s connect them, note that this symbol here is used for fiber optic connections in
packet tracer, notice the two spaces, for both the transmit and receive cables.

Finally, R3 and R4 are separated by 250 meters.

That’s too long for a UTP cable, but also not so long that we need single-mode fiber.

A multimode fiber cable would be sufficient.

Let’s connect them together.
.
.
Okay, the devices are now all connected.

That’s all for this lab.

Thank you for watching.
