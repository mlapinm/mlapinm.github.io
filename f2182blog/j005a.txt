Thanks for your help. Let’s get started.
22.720
In this lab you will use what you learned in Day 2’s lecture video to connect these network devices together.
29.439
You can select various types of connections from the bottom left here.
33.040
We’ll be using copper straight-through, copper cross-over, and fiber connections.
40.740
Note that packet tracer doesn’t differentiate between single-mode and multimode fiber, but
46.219
try to think about which type would be appropriate when you use a fiber connection.
50.950
So, I’ll start here in the bottom left.
54.370
First, the connection between SW3 and PC1.
59.940
For the purpose of this lab, we’re assuming that Auto MDI-X is disabled or not supported
65.300
on the devices, so we have to think about whether to use a straight-through or cross-over copper cable.
72.640
PCs transmit data on pins 1 and 2, and receive data on pins 3 and 6.
79.970
Switches are the opposite, they transmit data on pins 3 and 6 and receive data on pins 1 and 2.
87.750
So, we can use a straight-through cable to connect all of these PCs, as well as SRV1, to the switches.
95.930
Select straight-through cable here, and connect the PCs to their appropriate switch.
101.690
PC1 to SW3..connect the fastethernet0 interface on the PC, which is the PC’s network interface
109.570
card, to any of the fastethernet interfaces on the switch.
113.970
Next is PC2 to SW4...PC3 to SW7...and SRV1 to SW8.
126.560
Now we’ve got a bunch of switches to connect together.
130.080
Devices of the same type require crossover cables, or else the transmit pins will be
134.590
connected to the transmit pins, and the receive pins will be connected to the receive pins,
140.450
which will not allow data to be sent successfully between the devices.
143.700
So, let’s connect these switches, SW3 to SW1...SW1 to SW2...SW4 to SW2...SW7 to SW5...
159.970
SW5 to SW6...and last SW8 to SW6.
171.240
Next let’s connect these switches to the routers.
174.590
Routers are like PCs, they transmit on pins 1 and 2 and receive on pins 3 and 6.
182.090
So let’s connect them to the switches with straight-through cables.
185.990
SW1 to R2...SW2 to R2...SW5 to R4...and SW6 to R4.
200.400
Now it’s time to connect the routers.
204.830
Since they are the same device type, we need to use crossover cables if we use copper cabling.
211.120
Take care to look at the distances here.
214.430
Since R1 and R2 are just 50 meters apart, we can use copper cabling, which permits distances
221.400
up to 100 meters.
223.849
So I’ll connect R2 to R1 with a crossover cable. R1 and R3 are 3 kilometers apart,
233.790
so clearly we will have to use a fiber-optic connection here.
238.280
Although packet tracer doesnt differentiate between single-mode and multimode, which is appropriate here?
243.960
Well, mutli mode fiber allows distances up to 550 meters, which is more than UTP, but
251.069
not enough for this connection.
254.180
Single-mode allows much longer distances, 30 kilometers, 40 kilometers, even more, so
259.980
in this case we would use single-mode fiber.
263.099
Let’s connect them, note that this symbol here is used for fiber optic connections in
269.150
packet tracer, notice the two spaces, for both the transmit and receive cables.
275.370
Finally, R3 and R4 are separated by 250 meters.
281.029
That’s too long for a UTP cable, but also not so long that we need single-mode fiber.
287.189
A multimode fiber cable would be sufficient.
290.150
Let’s connect them together...Okay, the devices are now all connected.
296.289
That’s all for this lab.
