5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,120
get all of the lab files for this course, so&nbsp;
you can try it out yourself in packet tracer.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,760
If you want more labs like these, I highly&nbsp;
recommend picking up Boson’s NetSim for the CCNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,720
It’s a network simulator with tons of guided&nbsp;
labs covering all of the topics you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,880
know for the CCNA. Click the link in&nbsp;
the video description to check it out.

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,880
In this lab we’ll configure dynamic NAT as well&nbsp;
as PAT. This is the same network topology as in&nbsp;&nbsp;

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,800
the previous lab, so let’s get right into it.&nbsp;
In step 1 I’ll configure dynamic NAT on R1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:04,960
First let me configure the inside and outside&nbsp;
interfaces. ENABLE. CONF T. INTERFACE G0/0.&nbsp;&nbsp;

12
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,080
This is the external interface, connected&nbsp;
to the Internet, so IP NAT OUTSIDE. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

13
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:23,760
INTERFACE G0/1. IP NAT INSIDE. Now, I want to&nbsp;
translate all traffic from 172.16.0.0/24, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

14
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:36,640
let me create an ACL that matches that source IP.&nbsp;
EXIT. ACCESS-LIST 1 PERMIT 172.16.0.0 0.0.0.255.&nbsp;&nbsp;

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:45,280
So, anytime PC1, 2, or 3 sends traffic out&nbsp;
to the Internet, R1 will translate it. Next&nbsp;&nbsp;

16
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,200
I’ll create the address pool. The instructions&nbsp;
say to create a pool with just two addresses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:02:00,800
100.0.0.1 and 100.0.0.2. So let’s make&nbsp;
it. IP NAT POOL, and I’ll name it POOL1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:13,360
then 100.0.0.1 100.0.0.2, then NETMASK, and I’ll&nbsp;
just specify /24, 255.255.255.0, because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

19
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:21,840
instructions say ‘from the 100.0.0.0/24 subnet’.&nbsp;
Finally, I’ll configure the NAT statement itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

20
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:31,200
IP NAT INSIDE SOURCE LIST 1 POOL POOL1. So,&nbsp;
R1’s dynamic NAT configuration is now complete.

21
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,360
Next, let’s try to ping google.com from the&nbsp;
PCs. First, PC1. Actually, I’ll just ping the&nbsp;&nbsp;

22
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:48,320
DNS server, 8.8.8.8, first. PING 8.8.8.8. I just&nbsp;
want to make sure all the devices finish the ARP&nbsp;&nbsp;

23
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,280
process first, as I’ve said many times before&nbsp;
it can be a little slow in packet tracer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

24
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:04,560
Okay, now let’s ping google.com. PING google.com.&nbsp;
Okay, the ping works. Now I’ll do the same on PC2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

25
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:21,280
PING google.com. It works here too. Finally, PC3.&nbsp;
PING google.com. No response on PC3, why is that?&nbsp;&nbsp;

26
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,880
Well, I only configured two public IP addresses&nbsp;
in the NAT pool, and they are currently being&nbsp;&nbsp;

27
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:34,480
used by PC1 and PC2, so PC3 can’t get a public&nbsp;
IP address. Let’s check the translations on R1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

28
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:45,440
DO SHOW IP NAT TRANSLATIONS. Okay, so there are&nbsp;
lots of translations here, notice that 172.16.0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;

29
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,800
has been mapped to 100.0.0.1,&nbsp;
and .2 has been mapped to .2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,920
Now, the output in packet tracer is a little&nbsp;
different than I demonstrated in the lecture&nbsp;&nbsp;

31
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:03,040
video. We have ICMP entries and UDP entries,&nbsp;
but the simple inside local to inside global&nbsp;&nbsp;

32
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,480
mappings I showed in the lecture video aren’t&nbsp;
entered into the table. Just be aware that&nbsp;&nbsp;

33
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,840
packet tracer doesn’t always operate exactly as&nbsp;
real Cisco IOS will, and don’t worry about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

34
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,480
In the CCNA exam you might be asked to interpret&nbsp;
the output of a NAT table like this, but you won’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

35
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,520
be asked something like ‘which entries will&nbsp;
be in the NAT table if PC1 pings the server?’.

36
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,160
Okay, so in step 3 we are going&nbsp;
to change the configuration to PAT&nbsp;&nbsp;

37
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,480
using R1’s public IP address,&nbsp;
the one on its g0/0 interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;

38
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:46,800
First I’ll clear the translations. DO CLEAR&nbsp;
IP NAT TRANSLATION, and then an asterisk. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

39
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,040
the instructions say to remove the current NAT&nbsp;
configuration, but let me show you something.&nbsp;&nbsp;

40
00:04:52,080 --> 00:05:01,920
DO SHOW RUN | INCLUDE NAT. Okay, so we have the&nbsp;
command IP NAT INSIDE SOURCE LIST 1 POOL POOL1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

41
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:12,240
Now, without deleting that I’ll enter IP NAT&nbsp;
INSIDE SOURCE LIST 1 INTERFACE G0/0 OVERLOAD.&nbsp;&nbsp;

42
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:21,680
And now let’s check the running-config again. DO&nbsp;
SHOW RUN | INCLUDE NAT. The previous NAT statement&nbsp;&nbsp;

43
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,720
has been replaced, so there isn’t actually any&nbsp;
need to remove the old configuration first.&nbsp;&nbsp;

44
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,480
Although, the pool still remains so you&nbsp;
can remove that too if you want. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

45
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:39,200
so that’s all we need for the PAT configuration,&nbsp;
I specified INTERFACE G0/0 OVERLOAD so R1 should&nbsp;&nbsp;

46
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:48,960
translate all traffic from 172.16.0.0/24 to the&nbsp;
IP address of its g0/0 interface, 203.0.113.1.

47
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,920
Let’s try it, I’ll ping google.com from&nbsp;
each PC again, PC1 first. PING google.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;

48
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:07,920
Okay, and then PC2. PING google.com. Next&nbsp;
PC3, let’s see if the ping works this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

49
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:17,040
PING google.com. Okay, this time it works. Now&nbsp;
let’s check the translations on R1 once more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

50
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:29,120
DO SHOW IP NAT TRANSLATIONS. Notice that all of&nbsp;
the inside local addresses, 172.16.0.1, 2, and 3,&nbsp;&nbsp;

51
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:37,920
are translated to the inside global address&nbsp;
203.0.113.1. R1 uses the protocol and port numbers&nbsp;&nbsp;

52
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,520
to keep track of the different communication flows&nbsp;
between the PCs, the DNS server, and google.com.

53
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,640
Okay, in this lab we configured&nbsp;
dynamic NAT using a NAT pool,&nbsp;&nbsp;

54
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,880
and then changed it to PAT&nbsp;
using R1’s interface IP address.&nbsp;&nbsp;

55
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:01,840
That’s all for this lab. Next let’s take a look at&nbsp;
a bonus lab in Boson Software’s NetSim for CCNA.
