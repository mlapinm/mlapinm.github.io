4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,120
In this video we will cover SNMP, the&nbsp;
Simple Network Management Protocol.&nbsp;&nbsp;

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,960
SNMP is mentioned in exam topic 4.4, which says&nbsp;
you must be able to explain the function of SNMP&nbsp;&nbsp;

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,320
in network operations. So, you don’t need&nbsp;
to know the detailed workings of SNMP,&nbsp;&nbsp;

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,400
know how to set up an SNMP server,&nbsp;
how to configure SNMP, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,200
Basically, you just need to know its&nbsp;
role and purpose in network operations.

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,000
Here’s what we’ll cover in this video.&nbsp;
First I’ll give an overview of SNMP,&nbsp;&nbsp;

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,480
its purpose, how it works, etc.
Then I’ll introduce the different&nbsp;&nbsp;

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,360
versions of SNMP. There have actually been many&nbsp;
different versions developed over the years,&nbsp;&nbsp;

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,240
however you only really need to know 3 of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,160
I’ll also give an overview of the different&nbsp;
messages SNMP uses to fulfill its purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,680
And finally, some very basic SNMP configurations.&nbsp;
Although the exam topics don’t list SNMP&nbsp;&nbsp;

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,960
configuration as a requirement, I think it’s a&nbsp;
good idea to learn some very basic commands which&nbsp;&nbsp;

16
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,640
we will then try out in the next lab video.&nbsp;
Watch until the end of the video for a bonus&nbsp;&nbsp;

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,640
practice question from Boson Software’s ExSim&nbsp;
for CCNA, the best practice exams for the CCNA.

18
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:43,760
So let me give you an overview of SNMP. SNMP is&nbsp;
an industry-standard framework and protocol that&nbsp;&nbsp;

19
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:50,800
was originally released in 1988. Most people think&nbsp;
of SNMP as a single protocol, but actually it fits&nbsp;&nbsp;

20
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,960
into a larger framework of network management,&nbsp;
sometimes called the SNMP framework. The first&nbsp;&nbsp;

21
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:05,360
RFC was RFC 1065, structure and identification of&nbsp;
management information for TCP/IP-based internets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

22
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,640
I think I mentioned RFCs, Requests For Comments,&nbsp;
at some point earlier in the course. These are&nbsp;&nbsp;

23
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,400
how the IETF, Internet Engineering Task&nbsp;
Force, defines standards for the Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

24
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:27,120
The next RFC for SNMP was RFC 1066, management&nbsp;
information base for network management of&nbsp;&nbsp;

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:34,560
TCP/IP-based internets. And one more, RFC&nbsp;
1067, a simple network management protocol.&nbsp;&nbsp;

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,480
These three RFCs together make up SNMP version&nbsp;
1. There have been many more RFCs since then&nbsp;&nbsp;

27
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,040
defining other versions of SNMP, a few of&nbsp;
which I’ll introduce later in this video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

28
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,400
By the way, you don’t have to memorize these&nbsp;
RFCs, I’m just giving a little history.&nbsp;&nbsp;

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,440
Don’t let the ‘simple’ in the name fool&nbsp;
you! Although SNMPv1 was relatively simply&nbsp;&nbsp;

30
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,720
compared to the later versions, the current&nbsp;
version SNMPv3 is actually fairly complicated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

31
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,840
I know I still have a lot to learn about SNMP.&nbsp;
Fortunately, for the CCNA or even the CCNP&nbsp;&nbsp;

32
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,800
you don’t need to know all the details, but you&nbsp;
do need to understand the purpose and basics of&nbsp;&nbsp;

33
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:24,160
SNMP. SNMP can be used to monitor the status&nbsp;
of devices, make configuration changes, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;

34
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,000
There are two main types of devices in SNMP.&nbsp;
First, there are the managed devices. These are&nbsp;&nbsp;

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,560
the devices being managed using SNMP. For example,&nbsp;
network devices like routers and switches.&nbsp;&nbsp;

36
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,760
We can use SNMP to monitor the status of&nbsp;
the routers and switches in our networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

37
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,920
And the second type is the Network Management&nbsp;
Station, NMS. You might also hear Network&nbsp;&nbsp;

38
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,360
Management System, instead of Station.&nbsp;
It’s the same thing. This is the device,&nbsp;&nbsp;

39
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,000
or devices, managing the managed devices I&nbsp;
mentioned above. This is the SNMP ‘server’,&nbsp;&nbsp;

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,840
although typically we use the&nbsp;
term NMS instead of SNMP server.

41
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,760
Let’s look more at how SNMP works. In this&nbsp;
network, SRV1 is the NMS, Network Management&nbsp;&nbsp;

42
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:22,560
Station or System. We’re using SNMP to manage R1&nbsp;
and SW1, so they are the managed devices. There&nbsp;&nbsp;

43
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,720
are three main operations used in SNMP, three main&nbsp;
ways SNMP can be used to help manage a network.&nbsp;&nbsp;

44
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,680
The first one is that managed&nbsp;
devices can notify the NMS of events.&nbsp;&nbsp;

45
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,840
For example, perhaps SW1’s G0/1 interface had a&nbsp;
hardware failure and it’s status changed to DOWN.&nbsp;&nbsp;

46
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,160
It can send an SNMP message to the NMS, SRV1,&nbsp;
telling it that the G0/1 interface has gone down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

47
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,720
The actual SNMP software on the server, or&nbsp;
the NMS, might be configured to notify the&nbsp;&nbsp;

48
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,920
network administrator to inform&nbsp;
them of this event, for example.

49
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,440
Okay, so managed devices can notify the NMS of&nbsp;
events such as interfaces going up and down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

50
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,120
The NMS can also ask the managed devices&nbsp;
for information about their status.&nbsp;&nbsp;

51
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,440
For example, perhaps the NMS, SRV1,&nbsp;
asks R1 what its current CPU usage is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

52
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,160
You want to make sure your network devices&nbsp;
aren’t being overloaded and working too hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

53
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,600
R1 will then reply to the NMS, for example&nbsp;
telling SRV1 that its CPU usage is at 50%.&nbsp;&nbsp;

54
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,960
So, that’s another function of SNMP.

55
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,200
And one more main operation used by SNMP is&nbsp;
when the NMS tells the managed devices to change&nbsp;&nbsp;

56
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:48,080
aspects of their configuration. For example,&nbsp;
let’s say the IP address of R1’s G0/1 interface&nbsp;&nbsp;

57
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:57,600
is 203.0.113.1/30. The NMS can tell R1 to&nbsp;
change that IP address to 203.0.113.5/30.&nbsp;&nbsp;

58
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,360
R1 will change the IP address&nbsp;
and tell the NMS that it did so.&nbsp;&nbsp;

59
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:10,160
So, those are the three main operations used&nbsp;
in SNMP. The managed devices can notify the&nbsp;&nbsp;

60
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,920
NMS of events, the NMS can ask managed devices&nbsp;
for information about their current status,&nbsp;&nbsp;

61
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,560
and the NMS can also tell the managed&nbsp;
devices to change their configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;

62
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,160
Now let’s look a little deeper&nbsp;
into how this all works.

63
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,120
These are the main components of SNMP.&nbsp;&nbsp;

64
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,200
Up top there is the NMS from the&nbsp;
previous network diagram, SRV1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

65
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,480
On the bottom, the two managed devices, SW1 and&nbsp;
R1. Let me break this diagram down step by step.

66
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,480
First, the components of the NMS. Let this green&nbsp;
section represent the SNMP software on the NMS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

67
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,720
The NMS probably isn’t a machine dedicated&nbsp;
to SNMP. It could just be the network admin’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

68
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,840
PC which is running SNMP software. So, what&nbsp;
components are there in the NMS’s SNMP software?&nbsp;&nbsp;

69
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,880
First, the SNMP Manager is the SNMP software on&nbsp;
the NMS that interacts with the managed devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;

70
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:15,840
It receives notifications, sends requests for&nbsp;
information, sends configuration changes, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;

71
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,680
Next there is an SNMP application, this is&nbsp;
the application that provides an interface&nbsp;&nbsp;

72
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,680
for the network admin to interact&nbsp;
with. It displays alerts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

73
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,000
statistics, charts, etc. Here’s what an&nbsp;
SNMP Application might look like. There are&nbsp;&nbsp;

74
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,840
plenty of free and commercial SNMP applications&nbsp;
available. This screenshot is from SolarWinds.

75
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,880
Next, let’s look at the managed devices, SW1&nbsp;
and R1 from our example before. This blue area&nbsp;&nbsp;

76
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,960
represents the SNMP entity on the managed&nbsp;
devices. These devices are a router and a switch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

77
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,840
so of course SNMP is just a part of what’s running&nbsp;
on these devices. The first component is the SNMP&nbsp;&nbsp;

78
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,680
Agent. This is the SNMP software running on the&nbsp;
managed devices that interacts with the SNMP&nbsp;&nbsp;

79
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,840
Manager on the NMS. It sends notifications&nbsp;
to and receives messages from the NMS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

80
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,440
Another important component is the&nbsp;
MIB, Management Information Base.&nbsp;&nbsp;

81
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,640
This is the structure that contains the variables&nbsp;
that are managed by SNMP. Each of these variables&nbsp;&nbsp;

82
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:31,200
is identified with an Object ID, OID. Some&nbsp;
examples of variables stored in the MIB&nbsp;&nbsp;

83
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,440
are the status of each interface on&nbsp;
the device, the traffic throughput,&nbsp;&nbsp;

84
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:42,480
CPU usage, device temperature, etc. Each of&nbsp;
these will have their own OID to identify them.

85
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:50,240
So, that’s the basic structure of SNMP. Then,&nbsp;
the SNMP messages exchanged between the agent&nbsp;&nbsp;

86
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:57,520
and manager make SNMP work. Now before moving on&nbsp;
to introduce the different SNMP versions, let me&nbsp;&nbsp;

87
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,760
briefly introduce those Object IDs, OIDs, that are&nbsp;
organized in the Management Information Base, MIB.

88
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,800
SNMP Object IDs are organized in a hierarchical&nbsp;
structure. Here’s an example of an OID, and here’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

89
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:22,080
how it breaks down. iso, identified-organization,&nbsp;
dod, internet, mgmt, mib-2, system,&nbsp;&nbsp;

90
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,880
and sysName. So, this OID is used to identify the&nbsp;
system name, the host name, of the managed device.&nbsp;&nbsp;

91
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,840
For example, here’s that same network again.&nbsp;
The NMS asks one of the managed devices, SW1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

92
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:44,080
what value do you have for this OID? SW1 then&nbsp;
replies, telling the NMS its host name. There are&nbsp;&nbsp;

93
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,520
countless different OIDs. If you want to explore&nbsp;
some different OIDs you can take a look around&nbsp;&nbsp;

94
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:56,400
oid-info.com. That’s how I got the OID information&nbsp;
for the system name OID I used as an example here.

95
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,880
Now let me give a brief overview of the major&nbsp;
SNMP versions. Many versions of SNMP have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

96
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,920
proposed and developed, however only three&nbsp;
major versions have achieved wide-spread use.&nbsp;&nbsp;

97
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:20,160
The first is SNMPv1, this is the original version&nbsp;
of SNMP. The next version is SNMPv2c. There are&nbsp;&nbsp;

98
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:28,480
multiple versions of SNMPv2, but v2c is the most&nbsp;
widely used. Version 2 added another message type&nbsp;&nbsp;

99
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,440
which allows the NMS to retrieve large amounts&nbsp;
of information from a managed device using a&nbsp;&nbsp;

100
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,240
single request, making it much more efficient,&nbsp;
there is less unnecessary network traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

101
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,160
The ‘c’ in the name refers to the ‘community&nbsp;
strings’, which are passwords that were used&nbsp;&nbsp;

102
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,240
in SNMPv1, removed from SNMPv2, and&nbsp;
then added back for this version,&nbsp;&nbsp;

103
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,480
SNMPv2c. When we take a look at SNMP&nbsp;
configuration I’ll use version 2c to&nbsp;&nbsp;

104
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,840
demonstrate, so you’ll see how these community&nbsp;
strings work. Basically they’re just passwords.&nbsp;&nbsp;

105
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,000
Okay, the next major version and&nbsp;
the best version so far is SNMPv3.&nbsp;&nbsp;

106
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,480
It is a much more secure version of SNMP that&nbsp;
supports strong encryption and authentication.&nbsp;&nbsp;

107
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,040
I’ll talk more about those terms in&nbsp;
the security section of this course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

108
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,640
but basically it means that SNMPv3 makes&nbsp;
sure that only the intended devices can&nbsp;&nbsp;

109
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,040
read the SNMP messages, they can’t be&nbsp;
intercepted and read by an attacker.

110
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:37,360
Now let’s look at the SNMP message types. In this&nbsp;
chart I’ve listed the four message classes: read,&nbsp;&nbsp;

111
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,720
write, notification, and response. I’ve&nbsp;
also given a description of each class,&nbsp;&nbsp;

112
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,680
and then listed the actual&nbsp;
SNMP messages in each class.&nbsp;&nbsp;

113
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,040
First let’s take a look at the ‘read’ message&nbsp;
class. These messages are sent by the NMS to read&nbsp;&nbsp;

114
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:59,200
information from the managed devices. I already&nbsp;
showed a few examples before, like when SRV1&nbsp;&nbsp;

115
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:06,560
asked SW1 what its host name is. There are three&nbsp;
messages in this class, Get, GetNext, and GetBulk.

116
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,440
I think this is more depth than necessary for&nbsp;
the CCNA, so I’ll just give a very quick outline&nbsp;&nbsp;

117
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,920
of those messages. First up is the Get message.&nbsp;
It’s a request sent from the manager to the agent,&nbsp;&nbsp;

118
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,680
the NMS to the managed device, to&nbsp;
retrieve the value of a variable, an OID,&nbsp;&nbsp;

119
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,360
or multiple variables. The agent will send&nbsp;
a ‘Response’ message with the current value&nbsp;&nbsp;

120
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:39,280
of each variable. For example, our NMS here might&nbsp;
ask SW1, what’s the status of your G0/1 interface?&nbsp;&nbsp;

121
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:48,400
And SW1 responds with an SNMP ‘response’ message.&nbsp;
Another kind of SNMP ‘read’ message is GetNext. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

122
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:54,560
is sent from the manager to the agent to discover&nbsp;
the available variables in the MIB. Basically,&nbsp;&nbsp;

123
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,000
it says ‘tell me the next OID’, so it can be&nbsp;
used to discover what other OIDs are available.&nbsp;&nbsp;

124
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,040
There is also the GetBulk message, which is a more&nbsp;
efficient version of GetNext introduced in SNMPv2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

125
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,000
If you know the purpose of the basic Get&nbsp;
message, you’ll be fine for the CCNA.

126
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,280
So, those are the ‘read’ messages. Next up, the&nbsp;
‘write’ messages, and actually there is only one&nbsp;&nbsp;

127
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:25,200
kind of message, which is ‘Set’. These are sent&nbsp;
by the NMS to change information on the managed&nbsp;&nbsp;

128
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,400
devices, to change the value of a specific&nbsp;
variable, such as changing an IP address.

129
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,040
Just like with the Get message, I already&nbsp;
showed you an example of an SNMP Set message&nbsp;&nbsp;

130
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,680
when SRV1 made R1 change the IP&nbsp;
address of its G0/1 interface,&nbsp;&nbsp;

131
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:48,320
but I’ll demonstrate again. So, the Set message is&nbsp;
a request from the manager to the agent to change&nbsp;&nbsp;

132
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,640
the value of one or more variables. Then the agent&nbsp;
will send a Response message with the new values.&nbsp;&nbsp;

133
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,840
For example, SRV1 can send a Set message to SW1,&nbsp;
requesting that it change its host name to SW10.&nbsp;&nbsp;

134
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,520
SW1 will then change its host name, and send&nbsp;
a Response message with its new host name.

135
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,320
So, that’s the write message&nbsp;
class, with the Set message.&nbsp;&nbsp;

136
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,640
Next the ‘notification’ message class. These&nbsp;
are messages sent by the managed devices&nbsp;&nbsp;

137
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,280
to alert the NMS of a particular event,&nbsp;
for example when an interface goes down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

138
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,840
There are two different messages,&nbsp;
Trap and Inform. Let’s check them out.

139
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,840
First up, the Trap message. This is a&nbsp;
notification sent from the agent to the manager,&nbsp;&nbsp;

140
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,880
so the managed device to the NMS. The&nbsp;
manager does not send a Response message&nbsp;&nbsp;

141
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,720
to acknowledge that it received the&nbsp;
Trap, so these messages are unreliable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

142
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,840
Also, SNMP uses UDP, so there&nbsp;
are no TCP retransmissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

143
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,760
Now, unless there’s some problem in the&nbsp;
network the Trap will reach the NMS no problem,&nbsp;&nbsp;

144
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,640
but since there is no reliability mechanism&nbsp;
built-in they are called unreliable messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;

145
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,280
I showed an example before, but here’s&nbsp;
another. SW1’s G0/0 interface went down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

146
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:13,040
so it sends a Trap message to the NMS,&nbsp;
SRV1. That’s it, no response is sent to SW1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

147
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,800
This Trap will probably appear as an&nbsp;
alert in the SNMP application on SRV1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

148
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,920
and perhaps it will send an email notification&nbsp;
to the network admin, or something like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

149
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,680
Okay, the next kind of notification message is the&nbsp;
Inform message. It’s like a Trap message, but it&nbsp;&nbsp;

150
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,760
is acknowledged with a response message. So, even&nbsp;
though this message is sent with UDP, not TCP,&nbsp;&nbsp;

151
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:45,040
there is reliability built into the message&nbsp;
itself. If SW1 sends an Inform to SRV1, SRV1&nbsp;&nbsp;

152
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,960
will send a Response to tell SW1 that the Inform&nbsp;
was received. This message type was originally&nbsp;&nbsp;

153
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,680
used for communications between managers,&nbsp;
for networks with multiple SNMP managers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

154
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,440
However later updates to the protocol allow&nbsp;
agents to send Inform messages to managers, too.

155
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,440
So, those are the SNMP Trap and Inform messages.&nbsp;
Finally, the Response message class, with just&nbsp;&nbsp;

156
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,280
one message, Response. These are messages sent&nbsp;
in Response to a previous message or request.&nbsp;&nbsp;

157
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,240
For example, Get messages, Set messages, and&nbsp;
Inform messages. I just showed you some examples&nbsp;&nbsp;

158
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,640
of Response messages, so I think that’s enough for&nbsp;
now. So, those are the SNMP messages. I think the&nbsp;&nbsp;

159
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,920
information I just gave you will be more than&nbsp;
enough for the CCNA. I mentioned these port&nbsp;&nbsp;

160
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:42,080
numbers in the Day 30 video on TCP and UDP, but&nbsp;
SNMP Agents listen for messages on UDP port 161&nbsp;&nbsp;

161
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,840
and SNMP Managers listen for messages on UDP port&nbsp;
162. Make sure you remember those port numbers.

162
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,520
Now let me demonstrate some&nbsp;
basic SNMP configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;

163
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,200
As I said before, SNMP configuration&nbsp;
isn’t mentioned in the exam topics list,&nbsp;&nbsp;

164
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,120
but I think getting a bit of hands-on practice&nbsp;
is always helpful, so let’s try it out. We won’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

165
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,160
cover setting up the NMS, that’s definitely&nbsp;
out-of-scope for the CCNA, but let’s see how&nbsp;&nbsp;

166
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:17,600
to set up the SNMP agent on a Cisco router. In&nbsp;
this network, R1 is the managed device, and PC1&nbsp;&nbsp;

167
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:24,480
is the NMS, running an SNMP application. First&nbsp;
I configured some optional information on R1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

168
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,240
giving some contact information and the location&nbsp;
of the device. This is optional information, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

169
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,400
don’t need to configure this. Then I configured&nbsp;
two community strings. As I mentioned before,&nbsp;&nbsp;

170
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,560
these are basically SNMP passwords. Notice&nbsp;
that I specified the community string Jeremy1&nbsp;&nbsp;

171
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:50,000
as RO, this means read only. So, an NMS using&nbsp;
this password can only read information from R1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

172
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,040
it can’t use Set to make any changes to R1.&nbsp;
On the other hand, I specified Jeremy2 as RW,&nbsp;&nbsp;

173
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:03,280
read/write. An NMS using this password will be&nbsp;
able to both read, using Get messages, and write,&nbsp;&nbsp;

174
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,760
using Set messages. Note that there are actually&nbsp;
default community strings, ‘public’ for RO&nbsp;&nbsp;

175
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,320
and ‘private’ for RW. So, if you don’t specify&nbsp;
community strings these will be used. Of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

176
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,560
it’s best to configure the community strings and&nbsp;
not use the defaults, as they are less secure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

177
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,600
Then I specified the address of the NMS, PC1 at&nbsp;
192.168.1.1. In this command I also specified the&nbsp;&nbsp;

178
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:36,160
version and which community string to use with&nbsp;
this server. I configured Jeremy1, so PC1 will&nbsp;&nbsp;

179
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,840
be able to read information from R1, but it won’t&nbsp;
be able to use Set messages to make changes to R1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

180
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,680
So, the read/write community string Jeremy2&nbsp;
isn’t being used in this configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;

181
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:55,920
Then I configured what kinds of traps to send to&nbsp;
the NMS. I specified LINKDOWN and LINKUP messages,&nbsp;&nbsp;

182
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,920
so if an interface goes up or down Traps&nbsp;
will be sent. I also specified config traps,&nbsp;&nbsp;

183
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,600
so for example if configuration changes&nbsp;
are made Traps will be sent. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

184
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,640
that’s a simple SNMPv2c configuration. Let’s see&nbsp;
what happens when R1’s G0/1 interface goes down.

185
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,960
Here’s a Wireshark capture of the Trap that was&nbsp;
sent from R1 to the NMS, PC1. If you look at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

186
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,680
bottom, you’ll see numerous OIDs included in this&nbsp;
Trap. I looked up this OID using oid-info.com,&nbsp;&nbsp;

187
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,680
and as you can see it is a linkDown Trap,&nbsp;
notifying the NMS that R1’s interface went down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

188
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,960
Okay, now let’s look at some other fields of&nbsp;
this SNMP message. You can see the version of&nbsp;&nbsp;

189
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:49,120
2c that I configured. And here’s the community,&nbsp;
Jeremy1, the RO community string I configured.&nbsp;&nbsp;

190
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:57,920
Note that this community string, this password,&nbsp;
is displayed in plain text. In SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c,&nbsp;&nbsp;

191
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,720
there is no encryption. The community and&nbsp;
message contents are sent in plain-text.&nbsp;&nbsp;

192
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,360
This is not secure, as the packets&nbsp;
can easily be captured and read.&nbsp;&nbsp;

193
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,800
So, as I mentioned before SNMPv3 is&nbsp;
the preferred option. However SNMPv3&nbsp;&nbsp;

194
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:20,080
configuration is also more complicated, so for&nbsp;
this simple demonstration I selected version 2c.

195
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,480
So, before moving on to the quiz let me summarize&nbsp;
what we covered. SNMP helps manage devices over&nbsp;&nbsp;

196
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,560
a network. There are two main components of&nbsp;
SNMP. The managed devices are the devices being&nbsp;&nbsp;

197
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:40,160
managed using SNMP, such as network devices,&nbsp;
for example routers, switches, and firewalls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

198
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,400
The network management stations, NMS, are&nbsp;
the SNMP servers that manage the devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;

199
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,400
The NMS receives notifications from managed&nbsp;
devices. It can change the settings on managed&nbsp;&nbsp;

200
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,960
devices. It can also check on the status of&nbsp;
managed devices. Variables such as interface&nbsp;&nbsp;

201
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:05,840
status, temperature, traffic load, host name,&nbsp;
etc, are stored in the MIB of the managed devices,&nbsp;&nbsp;

202
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:12,560
and each variable is identified using an object&nbsp;
ID, OID. There are three main SNMP versions:&nbsp;&nbsp;

203
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:18,640
version 1, version 2c, and version 3. Version 3&nbsp;
is preferred because it is more secure than the&nbsp;&nbsp;

204
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,960
previous versions, providing encryption&nbsp;
and authentication of SNMP messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;

205
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:31,600
And these are the SNMP messages we covered: Get,&nbsp;
GetNext, GetBulk, Set, Trap, Inform, and Response.&nbsp;&nbsp;

206
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,640
Okay, that should be more than enough&nbsp;
information about SNMP for the CCNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

207
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,840
Remember, the exam topics state you need to&nbsp;
know the function of SNMP in network operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

208
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,400
There’s a lot more that can be learned about&nbsp;
SNMP, of course, but I’ll leave it here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

209
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,320
As always, make sure to watch until the end of&nbsp;
the quiz for a bonus practice question from Boson&nbsp;&nbsp;

210
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,480
Software’s ExSim, the best practice exams for the&nbsp;
CCNA. Okay, let’s go to question 1 of the quiz.

211
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,040
Which of the following SNMP&nbsp;
messages are used by the NMS&nbsp;&nbsp;

212
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,560
to ‘read’ information from the managed&nbsp;
devices? (select all that apply)&nbsp;&nbsp;

213
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,840
Here are the options. Pause the&nbsp;
video to think about the answers.

214
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,520
The answers are D, Get, and G,&nbsp;
GetNext. In addition to these,&nbsp;&nbsp;

215
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,080
there is also the GetBulk message which is used&nbsp;
to read information from the managed devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;

216
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:31,360
By the way, F, SetBulk, is not a real SNMP&nbsp;
message type. Okay, let’s go to question 2.

217
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,360
Which of the following SNMP&nbsp;
messages are sent to UDP port 162?&nbsp;&nbsp;

218
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,040
Select all that apply. Here are the options.&nbsp;
Pause the video to think about your answers.

219
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:55,440
The answers are A, Inform, and B, Trap. The&nbsp;
NMS listens on UDP port 162 for SNMP messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;

220
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:02,240
Informs and Traps are both sent from the managed&nbsp;
devices to the NMS, to they are sent to port 162.&nbsp;&nbsp;

221
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,280
Set and Get messages are sent from&nbsp;
the NMS to the managed devices,&nbsp;&nbsp;

222
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,800
which listen on port 161, so they are&nbsp;
incorrect. Okay, let’s go to question 3.

223
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,360
Which of the following SNMP message&nbsp;
types was introduced in SNMPv2&nbsp;&nbsp;

224
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,400
and allows mass-retrieval of&nbsp;
information from managed devices?&nbsp;&nbsp;

225
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,320
Here are the options. Pause the&nbsp;
video to think about the answer.

226
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:36,320
The answer is D, GetBulk. GetBulk is like an&nbsp;
optimized version of GetNext, allowing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

227
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:42,480
NMS to discover the variables in the MIB of the&nbsp;
managed devices. Okay, let’s go to question 4.

228
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,640
Which of the following pieces&nbsp;
of software runs on an SNMP NMS?&nbsp;&nbsp;

229
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,480
Here are the options. Pause the&nbsp;
video to think about your answer.

230
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,360
The answer is C, the SNMP Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;

231
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,360
This is the software that interacts with&nbsp;
the SNMP Agent on the managed devices. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

232
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,680
sends SNMP messages to and receives messages&nbsp;
from the Agent. Okay, let’s go to question 5.

233
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,240
Which of the following SNMP messages&nbsp;
is sent without expecting a Response?&nbsp;&nbsp;

234
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,320
Here are the options. Pause the&nbsp;
video to think about your answer.

235
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:34,560
The answer is D, Trap. Traps are messages sent&nbsp;
by SNMP managed devices to the NMS. Trap messages&nbsp;&nbsp;

236
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,400
aren’t acknowledged with a Response, so they are&nbsp;
considered unreliable. Even if the message is lost&nbsp;&nbsp;

237
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:46,240
in transmit for some reason, the managed device&nbsp;
won’t send the Trap again. Okay, that’s all for&nbsp;&nbsp;

238
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:52,000
the quiz. Next let’s take a look at a bonus&nbsp;
question in Boson Software’s ExSim for CCNA.

239
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:00,880
Okay here's today's Boson ExSim practice question.&nbsp;
Which of the following SNMP actions are used by an&nbsp;&nbsp;

240
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:08,240
NMS to extract information from an SNMP agent?&nbsp;
Select 2 choices. So here are the choices,&nbsp;&nbsp;

241
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:15,280
we have Inform, Trap, GetNext, Set, and Get. So&nbsp;
pause the video now to think about the answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

242
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:28,320
Okay so let's check. So it's asking us which of&nbsp;
these SNMP actions, or messages, are used by an&nbsp;&nbsp;

243
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:35,440
NMS, that's the network management station, the&nbsp;
server, to extract information from an SNMP agent,&nbsp;&nbsp;

244
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:43,440
a managed device? So these first two choices,&nbsp;
Inform and Trap, are definitely incorrect. These&nbsp;&nbsp;

245
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:52,800
messages are sent from the SNMP agent, the managed&nbsp;
device, to the NMS. So A and B are incorrect. C,&nbsp;&nbsp;

246
00:25:52,800 --> 00:26:02,080
D, and E are all sent from the NMS to the&nbsp;
managed device. GetNext is used to get the name,&nbsp;&nbsp;

247
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:09,040
or the object ID, of the next object, the next&nbsp;
variable, in the MIB. So, this helps the NMS&nbsp;&nbsp;

248
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:15,840
to discover what objects, what OIDs, are in the&nbsp;
management information base of the managed device.&nbsp;&nbsp;

249
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:22,640
So I think that is one of the correct&nbsp;
answers, that is used to extract information&nbsp;&nbsp;

250
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:30,320
from an SNMP agent. Now, Set is used to&nbsp;
change a variable on an agent. So it's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

251
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:36,560
used to extract information, it's used to change&nbsp;
information. So I think D is incorrect. And then E&nbsp;&nbsp;

252
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:44,880
is used to get the value of one of the variables,&nbsp;
one of the OIDs, in the MIB of the SNMP agent. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

253
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,800
I think E is correct also. So the two correct&nbsp;
answers should be C and E. So, you can check&nbsp;&nbsp;

254
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:56,560
the answers in Boson ExSim by clicking on 'show&nbsp;
answer'. And those are the two correct answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

255
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,960
So here is Boson's explanation, including an&nbsp;
explanation of all of the SNMP message types&nbsp;&nbsp;

256
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,840
I mentioned in this video. You can pause&nbsp;
the video now to read the explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

257
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,160
And there is more down here,&nbsp;
with some output from Cisco IOS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

258
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,920
And here. And there's also a&nbsp;
reference to some Cisco documentation&nbsp;&nbsp;

259
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,720
about the SNMP Get message type.&nbsp;&nbsp;

260
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:32,720
Okay so that was a look at Boson Software's ExSim&nbsp;
for CCNA. As I have said before, these are by far&nbsp;&nbsp;

261
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,480
the best practice exams for the CCNA, and they are&nbsp;
the ones I used myself a few years ago to study&nbsp;&nbsp;

262
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,480
for my CCNA exam. If you want to get Boson ExSim,&nbsp;
please follow the link in the video description.

263
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,680
There are supplementary materials for&nbsp;
this video. There is a flashcard deck&nbsp;&nbsp;

264
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,320
to use with the software ‘Anki’. There&nbsp;
will also be a packet tracer practice lab&nbsp;&nbsp;

265
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,440
so you can get some hands-on&nbsp;
practice. That will be in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

266
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,560
next video. Sign up for my mailing&nbsp;
list via the link in the description,&nbsp;&nbsp;

267
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,320
and I’ll send you all of the flashcards&nbsp;
and packet tracer lab files for the course.

268
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,800
