welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab you can download the lab

file from the link in the description if

you like these labs please consider

supporting me via my patreon or the

cryptocurrency options in the

description in this lab we are going to

continue with what we learned in the

previous lab in this lab however there

are now four routers and there are a lot

more static routes that need to be

configured try to complete the lab

yourself first then continue watching if

you have trouble or watch it after to

check your solution so in the previous

video I mentioned that as a network gets

larger it becomes unfeasible to

configure primary and backup routes to

each destination manually in this lab we

aren't even going to configure backup

routes and just by adding a few extra

routers the amount of static routes to

be configured has increased quite a bit

so exactly how many routes will we have

to configure well let's look at our one

it is directly connected to three

networks 10.10 slash 24 192.168 12.0

slash 24 and 192.168.0 slash 24 so we

don't have to configure routes to these

networks that means we will have to

configure routes to 192.168 24 0/24

192.168.0 slash 24 10020 slash 24 10.30

slash 24 and 10.40 slash 24 so we will

have to configure five static routes on

our one we will have to configure the

same number of routes on each other

router so that's a total of 20 static

routes on the scale of things that's not

a huge number of routes to configure

however compared to the two routes we

had to configure in the previous lab

it's quite a jump this is still a very

small and simple network to on the scale

of things this lab will be quite

repetitive but also good practice be

careful of misconfigurations when doing

repetitive work like this I'll of course

be careful too but if you spot any

mistakes I'll give you a shout out in

another video

anyway let's get started I'll hop on r1

enable conf T so let's create the static

routes we mentioned before IP route

192.168 2400 255.255.255.0 with the next

top of 192.168 12.2 which is our two IP

route 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0 with the

next top of 192.168 3 which is our 3 IP

route 10030 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.3

again our 3 is the next hop IP route

10020 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2 next top

of our two IP route 10.40 255.255.255.0

now this one we have a choice there are

two routes of equal distance we could go

R 2 to R 4 or via R 3 to R 4 let's go

with r 2 is the next hop

so 192.168.1.2 ok R 1 is now complete

now let's go on r2 and configure the

required routes those being 192.168.0

slash 24 192.168 dirty for 0/24 10.10

slash 24 10 debt owed 3.0 slash 24 and

10.40 slash 24 enable conf t IP route

192.168.0 255.255.255.0 192.168 12.1 r1

is the next hop IP route 192.168.0

255.255.255.0

192.168 24.4 r4 is the next hop IP route

10.10 255.255.255.0 192.168 12.1 r1 is

the next hop IP route 10030

255.255.255.0 again we can choose

between two equal distance routes R 1 2

R 3 or R 4 2 R 3 let's go with r1 so

192.168 12.1 IP route 10 0 for 0 to 5 5

to 5 5 to 5 5 0

192.168 24.4 our 4 is the next hop

that's all for r2

now let's configure the routes for r3 r3

requires routes to 192.168 12.0 / 24

192.168 24/24 10010 / 24 10020 / 24 and

10000 / 24 enable conf t IP route

192.168.0 255.255.255.0

192.168.1 r1 is the next hop IP route

192.168.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1 x top

IP route 10.10 255.255.255.0 192.168.1

r1 is the next hop IP route 10.20

255.255.255.0 again we have a choice

here I'll set r1 as the next hop

192.168.1 I P wrote 1000 255 255 255 0

192.168.0 for our 4 is the next hop

that's all for r3

finally let's configure static routes on

our four-hour Forney's routes to 192.168

twelve 0/24 192.168.0 / 24 10.10 / 24

10.20 / 24 and 10030 / 24 enable call 48

192.168 12.0 255.255.255.0 192.168 24 -

our 2 is the next hop IP route -

192.168.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.0 re our

3 is the next hop IP route 10.10

255.255.255.0 we have a choice here

between two equal distance routes but

let's go with art - so 192.168 24.2 IP

routes 1000 255.255.255.0

192.168 24 - our 2 is the next hop and

last one IP route 1000 255.255.255.0

when i 2.16 8.30 4.3 our 3 is the next

hop that's all for our 4 ok I hope that

didn't put you to sleep but I also hope

it helped you practice configuring

static routes we will do one more lab

dedicated to static routing focusing on

the creation of backup routes that's all

for this lab thank you for watching I

hope this lab and video have been

helpful for you please subscribe for

future labs like this which will be

released weekly if you have requests for
