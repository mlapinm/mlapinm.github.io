In this lab we’ll get some practice configuring static routes on Cisco routers.
24.010
Actually, there are going to be two labs for Day 11 of this course.
29.169
This first one, where you will configure static routes, and then the next one where you will
34.070
troubleshoot an already-configured network that has some problems.
38.070
Anyway, in this lab, we want to configure the network to allow PC1 and PC2 to ping eachother.
44.750
I haven’t done any pre-configurations on these devices at all, so we have to go in
50.360
and configure the hostnames, IP addresses, etc. first.
54.430
I chose not to do any preconfigurations so that you can get some extra practice with
59.510
the basics, as repetition is very important in getting used to using the CLI!
65.460
So, let’s do the basic configurations each device as instructed in step 1.
70.780
I’ll start on PC1 first...click on config, and the first thing we should configure is the gateway here.
81.060
This is the address to which PC1 will forward packets which are destined for a location
85.759
outside of the local network.
88.200
PC1’s gateway is R1, so I’ll put in R1’s IP address, 192.168.1.254.
96.829
Next, click on fastethernet0, which is PC1’s network interface, and type in the IP address
104.240
here, 192.168.1.1, and if you hit tab it automatically fills in the subnet mask for this class C
112.479
address, 255.255.255.0. Then, exit out.
118.200
Now, don’t worry about configuring the switches.
122.810
If you want you can go in and turn off unused interfaces, set interface descriptions, etc
128.030
for extra practice, but I think you’ll get plenty of practice just by configuring the routers.
133.599
So, let’s go on R1 next….from the CLI, I’ll use enable to enter privileged exec mode.
142.110
Then, configure terminal to enter global config mode.
145.660
Now, let’s set the hostname with this command: HOSTNAME R1.
151.960
Next I’ll configure the interfaces.
154.150
First, G0/1 which is connected to the internal LAN. INTERFACE G0/1.
161.079
Let’s set the IP address.
164.079
IP ADDRESS 192.168.1.254 255.255.255.0.
172.240
And how about a description?
174.269
DESCRIPTION ## to SW1 ##. Finally, let’s enable it. NO SHUTDOWN.
181.220
Next, the G0/0 interface connected to R2. INTERFACE G0/0.
188.310
I’ll set the IP address.
191.129
IP ADDRESS 192.168.12.1 255.255.255.0. Next, the description.
200.580
DESCRIPTION ## to R2 ##. And let’s enable it. NO SHUTDOWN.
206.439
Okay, let’s check on the interfaces.
209.459
DO SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.
212.099
Okay, you can see the IP addresses we configured.
215.290
G0/1 is up/up, but G0/0 is up/down.
220.420
That’s not a problem, it’s just because R2’s G0/0 interface is still shutdown.
227.730
Now let’s go on R2...enter privileged exec mode with ENABLE. Then CONFIGURE TERMINAL. Set the hostname. HOSTNAME R2.
241.420
Next I’ll configure G0/0 which is connected to R1. INTERFACE G0/0.
249.209
Set the IP address.
250.719
IP ADDRESS 192.168.12.2 255.255.255.0. Then the description.
259.620
DESCRIPTION ## to R1 ##. Now let’s enable it. NO SHUTDOWN.
265.370
Okay, now i’ll do the same on G0/1. INTERFACE G0/1.
271.830
IP ADDRESSS 192.168.13.2 255.255.255.0.
279.320
DESCRIPTION ## to R3 ##. NO SHUTDOWN. Okay, let’s check on the interfaces.
288.150
DO SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.
292.180
Like we saw on R1 before, this interface is UP/DOWN because R3’s interface is still
298.230
disabled, but the rest looks okay.
302.970
Okay next let’s go on R3...enter privileged exec mode with ENABLE. Then CONFIGURE TERMINAL. Set the hostname. HOSTNAME R3.
315.480
I’ll configure G0/0 which is connected to R2. INTERFACE G0/0.
323.030
Set the IP address.
324.450
IP ADDRESS 192.168.13.3 255.255.255.0. Then the description.
333.639
DESCRIPTION ## to R2 ##. Finally, enable it. NO SHUTDOWN.
339.349
Okay, let’s do the same steps on G0/1. INTERFACE G0/1.
344.720
IP ADDRESS 192.168.3.254 255.255.255.0.
353.360
DESCRIPTION ## to SW2 ##. NO SHUTDOWN.
358.100
Let’s check the interfaces status.
361.580
DO SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.
364.099
Okay, looks good, and the interfaces we configured are both up/up.
368.910
Finally, I’ll configure PC2...click config, then set the gateway here, which should be R3’s IP address. 192.168.3.254.
384.570
Then click on fastethernet0, and set the IP address here.
390.050
192.168.3.1, and hit tab to auto-fill the subnet mask.
394.710
Okay, so we’ve done the preconfigurations, just some review of basic commands for practice.
401.470
Now let’s get to the main point of this lab, configuring static routes.
406.650
Before starting, let’s think about what static routes we’ll have to configure.
411.310
We need two-way reachability, so PC1’s ping can reach PC2, and then PC2’s reply can reach PC1.
419.289
R1 is already connected to the 192.168.1.0/24 network, so it just needs a route to 192.168.3.0/24.
430.660
Likewise, R3 is already connected to 192.168.3.0/24, so it just needs a route to 192.168.1.0/24.
441.400
R2, however, is not connected to either of those networks, so it will need routes to both.
447.699
So, that means a total of four routes need to be configured.
451.690
One each on R1 and R3, and two on R2.
456.290
Let’s go on R1 and configure the first of the routes.
461.680
We have to be in global config mode, so I’ll type exit to get out of interface config mode.
468.389
Configure the route with this command, IP ROUTE, and let’s use the context sensistive
473.819
help to check the options.
475.699
So, it says destination prefix, meaning the network address, which is 192.168.3.0.
484.069
Use the context-sensitive help again, and next is the mask, which is 255.255.255.0, since it's /24.
493.430
Next, we can specify the ‘forwarding router’s address’, which is the IP address of the
498.689
next-hop router, or we can specify the exit interface, all of these options are interface types.
505.410
I’ll specify the next-hop address of R2, which is 192.168.12.2.
512.300
If I use context-sensitive help again, you can see there is another possible option,
517.250
distance metric for this route.
519.209
I’ll talk about this option in a later video, but this CR down here means we can just enter
524.640
the command as is.
526.700
Okay, now let’s check out R1’s routing table.
530.680
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.
532.840
There’s the static route we configured, as indicated by the S here.
538.149
You can also see the configured and local routes for R1’s two interfaces.
542.700
Remember, the local route is the actual address configured on the interface, with a /32 mask
548.630
so it specifies just that single address, and then the connected route is the network
553.540
address of the network the interface is connected to.
557.550
Okay, R1’s route is done, let’s go on R2.
562.570
Again, exit to get out of interface configuration mode.
567.110
Let’s configure the route to 192.168.1.0/24.
572.540
IP ROUTE 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0, and then just to practice the other option I’ll specify
582.660
the exit interface instead of the next-hop IP address. G0/0.
588.860
This message comes up, but you can ignore it.
591.560
It says ‘if not a point-to-point interface.
594.440
However, this is a point-to-point interface, meaning it connects only to one other device.
600.760
This is different than, for example, many routers connected to a single switch, which
605.089
we would call a shared segment.
606.920
Anyway, don’t worry about that for now. You can just ignore this message.
610.710
Okay, next lets configure the route to 192.168.3.0/24.
616.600
IP ROUTE 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0, and this time let’s do the next-hop IP address. 192.168.13.3.
631.040
Okay, let’s check the routing table. DO SHOW IP ROUTE.
636.420
Okay, here are the two static routes, and the connected and local routes for each interface. Looks good.
643.079
Finally, let’s configure R3’s static route.
648.380
Type EXIT to get out of interface config mode, and let’s configure a route to 192.168.1.0/24.
657.400
IP ROUTE 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.2, setting R2 as the next-hop.
669.140
Let’s check the routing table.
671.850
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.
674.029
Okay, looks good, one static route and the connected and local routes for each interface.
679.980
Now, let’s go on PC1 and try out that ping...click on desktop, then command prompt.
689.200
Okay, so this is the moment of truth.
691.860
The first ping might fail due to ARP, address resolution protocol, but once ARP is finished
698.139
the rest of the pings should work if we configured everything correctly. Let’s try. PING 192.168.3.1.
709.649
Okay, looks like PC1 is able to reach PC2, and PC2 is able to reach PC1 with its reply.
721.550
We have successfully configured static routing.
723.880
That’s all for this lab.
