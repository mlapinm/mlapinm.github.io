description 15.000561 in this lab we will
configure the system clock including the
timezone as well as Network Time
Protocol or NTP on three routers 24.988374 this
lab will only cover the absolute basics
of NTP configuration 29.681228 and in the
following lab we will configure NTP
authentication 33.809019 NTP is used to
synchronize time across devices 39.045290 it's
very important to have synchronized time
for a variety of reasons 43.953040 for example to
help identify when a particular problem
occurred 47.912956 when looking through logs on a
device 49.954414 in this lab we will manually
configure the time on r1 and then use it
as an NTP server for r2 to sync it's
time too 59.288685  we will then configure r3 to sync
it's time to r2 63.329622 and our network devices
will have synchronized time 66.256497 first let's
set the clock on r1 70.553872 enable show clock
75.236413 this command is used to display the time
of the device 78.455538 this is the default time
but where is it getting this time
82.401705 here's another useful command show clock
detail 87.483621 now we can see the time source
90.180350 which is the hardware calendar 91.872308 Cisco
devices have a hardware calendar built
into them 96.115558 and as you can see it is being
used by default 98.841329 let's change that 100.965829 first
let's set the time zone 103.830308 which is UTC by
default 105.929287 this is done from global
configuration mode 109.637370 conf t clock time
zone 114.218015 now let's check the next option 116.613015 we
have to enter the name of the time zone
119.885285 I'm in Japan
so I'll set it to jst 124.364139 now let's check
the next option 126.793285 hours offset from UTC 130.045910 in
my case jst is 9 hours ahead
of UTC 135.039889 so 9 the next option is minutes
offset from UTC 140.376014 which is zero in my case
so I'll just leave them in it's option
edit 144.915618 do show clock 147.428305 now as you can see
the time has changed and the time zone
has changed 152.042784 now let's set the time
itself
154.373034 to do this we have to go back to
privileged exec mode 158.758096 exit we can set the
time with this command 162.654137 clock set now one
important thing to remember is this the
clock set command sets the time in UTC
172.938699 the time zone command we set before only
affects how the time is displayed 177.947094 for
example in my case jst is nine hours
ahead of UTC 183.397802 so if I want to set the
time to 9:00 p.m. jst I have to set the
time as 12:00 p.m.
191.347510 as 12:00 p.m. UTC is 9:00 p.m.
jst 195.839094 for this video I'll do that set the
clock to 9:00 p.m. jst 201.241906 I won't set the
clock to the current time of my computer
since I record the audio and video at
separate times 207.456990 after clock set we have
to enter the time in the format shown
here 213.399156 twelve o'clock is what I have to
enter to set it to 9:00 p.m. jst 220.050718 the
next option is the month and date and we
can enter them in either order
226.442489 aughh 21 for August 21st 230.583509 the date I am
recording this video
232.397884 next is the year 2019 and that's it
show clock detail 242.373050 as you can see I
configure 12:00 p.m.
it's showing 9:00 p.m. or 21 in the
24-hour format 251.542446 and the time source is
now user configuration 254.425217 next let's
configure our one as an NTP server which
our two will sync it's time to 262.280634 conf t
NTP
now let's check the options 268.865945 here's one
interesting quirk 271.401820 to set this router as
an NTP server you don't use the NTP
server command 277.102007 but rather the option
above that NTP master 281.281632  NTP server will be
used on r2 to identify our one as an NTP
server to sink it's time to 287.805173 ok so NTP
master and the next option is what's
called the stratum level indicating how
authoritative the time on this server is
298.671381 the lower the number the more
authoritative 301.889151 we are instructed however
to use the default which will be 8 306.572505 to
use the default just enter the command
as is 310.370505 without adding the stratum level
at the end 312.632005 next let's configure our to
to sink it's time to r1 using NTP 319.236817 enable
show clock 324.468734 as you can see our twos time
is the default and is set to UTC 329.871380 first
I'll set the time zone to my local time
zone jst again 334.378567 note that NTP does not
sync the time zone 338.453921 it will sync the time
in UTC 340.558067 and then it's up to you to
configure which time zone that time is
displayed in on your device 345.424087 conf t clock
time zone is jst9 353.107357 ok now let's configure
NTP 356.747377 NTP server remember I said I'd use
this command on r2 to identify our one
as an NTP server to sync our twos time
too 366.198711 now we have to set the IP address of
the NTP server 371.072523 let's use our ones
address 192.168.12.1 377.378856 exit now normally
I'd use show commands immediately to
check the configuration 383.568710 however NTP can
take a very long time to synchronize 388.407585 for
example show clock detail 392.249460 this still
shows the time source as Hardware
calendar because NTP hasn't finished
syncing yet
398.671980 in fact I'm gonna cut this video here
and wait for NTP to sink 403.242105 welcome back
artoo has now synced its clock to our
one 409.443063 show clock detail as you can see the
time source is now ntp 416.161959 show ntp
associations 192.168.12.1 is the address
of r1 which we set as our ntp server 426.290125 the
reference clock of 127.127.1.1 is
our ones reference clock 432.479205 if you remember
when studying about IP addresses the 127 range is for loopback addresses 439.052829 so
this is a loopback address on r1 441.747349 okay
now let's configure r3 to sink it's time
to r2 448.254224 enable conf t I'll set the
time zone again first 455.496953 clock time zone is
jst9 460.416203 now I'll configure r3 to sync to r2 465.207119 NTP server 192.168.23.2 exit now once
again I'll cut the video here to give
NTP time to synchronize 478.311347 ok our 3 is now
synced to r2 483.840451 show ntp associations
486.164076 here is the address of r2 and it's
reference clock is our ones address of
