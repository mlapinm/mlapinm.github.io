supporting me via my patreon or the

cryptocurrency options in the

description in this lab we will

configure the system clock including the

timezone as well as Network Time

Protocol or NTP on three routers this

lab will only cover the absolute basics

of NTP configuration and in the

following lab we will configure NTP

authentication NTP is used to

synchronize time across devices it's

very important to have synchronized time

for a variety of reasons for example to

help identify when a particular problem

occurred when looking through logs on a

device in this lab we will manually

configure the time on r1 and then use it

as an NTP server for r2 to sync it's

time - we will then configure r3 to sync

it's time to r2 and our network devices

will have synchronized time first let's

set the clock on r1 enable show clock

this command is used to display the time

of the device this is the default time

but where is it getting this time

here's another useful command show clock

detail now we can see the time source

which is the hardware calendar Cisco

devices have a hardware calendar built

into them and as you can see it is being

used by default let's change that first

let's set the time zone which is UTC by

default this is done from global

configuration mode compte clock time

zone now let's check the next option we

have to enter the name of the time zone

I'm in Japan

so I'll set it to jst now let's check

the next option hours offset from UTC in

my case jst is 9 hours ahead

of UTC so 9 the next option is minutes

offset from UTC which is zero in my case

so I'll just leave them in it's option

edit do show clock now as you can see

the time has changed and the time zone

has changed now let's set the time

itself

to do this we have to go back to

privileged exec mode exit we can set the

time with this command clock set now one

important thing to remember is this the

clock set command sets the time in UTC

the time zone command we set before only

affects how the time is displayed for

example in my case jst is nine hours

ahead of UTC so if I want to set the

time to 9:00 p.m. jst I have to set the

time as 12:00 p.m.

as 12:00 p.m. UTC is 9:00 p.m.

jst for this video I'll do that set the

clock to 9:00 p.m. jst I won't set the

clock to the current time of my computer

since I record the audio and video at

separate times after clock set we have

to enter the time in the format shown

here twelve o'clock is what I have to

enter to set it to 9:00 p.m. jst the

next option is the month and date and we

can enter them in either order

aughh 21 for August 21st the date I am

recording this video

next is the year 2019 and that's it

show clock detail as you can see I

configure 12:00 p.m.

it's showing 9:00 p.m. or 21 in the

24-hour format and the time source is

now user configuration next let's

configure our one as an NTP server which

our two will sync it's time to call 50

NTP

now let's check the options here's one

interesting quirk to set this router as

an NTP server you don't use the NTP

server command but rather the option

above that NTP master NTP server will be

used on r2 to identify our one as an NTP

server to sink it's time to ok so NTP

master and the next option is what's

called the stratum level indicating how

authoritative the time on this server is

the lower the number the more

authoritative we are instructed however

to use the default which will be 8 to

use the default just enter the command

as is without adding the stratum level

at the end next let's configure our to

to sink it's time to r1 using NTP enable

show clock as you can see our twos time

is the default and is set to UTC first

I'll set the time zone to my local time

zone jst again note that NTP does not

sync the time zone it will sync the time

in UTC and then it's up to you to

configure which time zone that time is

displayed in on your device compte clock

time zone is t9 ok now let's configure

NTP NTP server remember I said I'd use

this command on r2 to identify our one

as an NTP server to sync our twos time

to now we have to set the IP address of

the NTP server let's use our ones

address 192.168.1.1 exit now normally

I'd use show commands immediately to

check the configuration however NTP can

take a very long time to synchronize for

example show clock detail this still

shows the time source as Hardware

calendar because NTP hasn't finished

syncing yet

in fact I'm gonna cut this video here

and wait for NTP to sink welcome back

artoo has now synced its clock to our

one show clock detail as you can see the

time source is now ntp show ntp

associations 192.168 12.1 is the address

of r1 which we set as our ntp server the

reference clock of 1 to 7.1 to 7.1.1 is

our ones reference clock if you remember

when studying about IP addresses the 1

to 7 range is for loopback addresses so

this is a loopback address on r1 okay

now let's configure r3 to sink it's time

to are to enable coffee tea I'll set the

time zone again first clock time zone is

t9 now I'll configure r3 to sync to our

to NTP server 192.168 23.2 exit now once

again I'll cut the video here to give

NTP time to synchronize ok our 3 is now

synced to our to show ntp associations

here is the address of r2 and it's

reference clock is our ones address of

192.168.0.0 this lab and video have been
