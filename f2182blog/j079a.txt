00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,280
get all of the lab files for this course, so&nbsp;
you can try it out yourself in packet tracer.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,080
If you want more labs like these, I highly&nbsp;
recommend picking up Boson’s NetSim for the CCNA,&nbsp;&nbsp;

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,880
click the link in the video description to check&nbsp;
it out. It’s a network simulator like packet&nbsp;&nbsp;

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,520
tracer, but it’s even better, and it includes&nbsp;
all of these guided labs to not only help you get&nbsp;&nbsp;

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,560
hands-on practice configuring and troubleshooting,&nbsp;
but also deepen your understanding of the exam&nbsp;&nbsp;

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,520
topics. If you want to get NetSim, please&nbsp;
follow the link in the video description.

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,160
In this video we’ll take a look at Syslog&nbsp;
and practice some basic configurations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,840
Syslog functionality in Packet Tracer isn’t&nbsp;
perfect, but it’s much more developed than packet&nbsp;&nbsp;

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,880
tracer’s SNMP functionality. We’ll take a look&nbsp;
at logging via the console line, the VTY lines,&nbsp;&nbsp;

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,600
the buffer, and an external Syslog server.

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,000
I’ll start with step 1, which says to&nbsp;
connect to R1’s console port using PC2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

16
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,640
If I click on R1 like this and go to the CLI tab,&nbsp;&nbsp;

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,880
this is the same as a console connection. However&nbsp;
accessing the device via a PC is more realistic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:38,080
that’s how we connect to real network devices, so&nbsp;
let’s go on PC2. From the desktop tab, click on&nbsp;&nbsp;

19
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:44,320
terminal, and these default settings are correct&nbsp;
so I’ll click OK. Now we’re in the CLI of R1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

20
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,520
I’ll log in, as it says above the username is&nbsp;
jeremy and password is ccna, and then ENABLE&nbsp;&nbsp;

21
00:01:51,520 --> 00:02:00,320
and the password is ccna again. Now I’ll shut&nbsp;
down the G0/0 interface. CONF T. INTERFACE G0/0.&nbsp;&nbsp;

22
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,280
SHUTDOWN. And we get two Syslog messages. Because&nbsp;
we’re connected to the console line, Syslog&nbsp;&nbsp;

23
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,480
messages are displayed by default. Why are two&nbsp;
messages displayed when the interface goes down?&nbsp;&nbsp;

24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:20,240
Let me show you. DO SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF. The&nbsp;
first message is referring to the STATUS here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

25
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,120
administratively down. And the second message&nbsp;
is referring to the PROTOCOL column, down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,520
So, that’s why two messages are displayed.&nbsp;
Okay, let’s enable it again. NO SHUTDOWN.&nbsp;&nbsp;

27
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,760
Okay, all of these messages are considered&nbsp;
severity level 5, also known as notice or&nbsp;&nbsp;

28
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,640
notification. However, these messages don’t&nbsp;
have timestamps, so let’s enable those.&nbsp;&nbsp;

29
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:50,800
EXIT. SERVICE TIMESTAMPS LOG DATETIME, and if I&nbsp;
try to enter the command it fails, why is that?&nbsp;&nbsp;

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,240
In packet tracer we have to enter the MSEC option,&nbsp;
to display milliseconds in the timestamps. In real&nbsp;&nbsp;

31
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,840
Cisco IOS, MSEC is just an option, you don’t have&nbsp;
to include it, but in Packet Tracer we have to.&nbsp;&nbsp;

32
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,040
Okay, now I’ll exit from global config&nbsp;
mode and you can see the log message now&nbsp;&nbsp;

33
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,400
includes a timestamp. I haven’t adjusted&nbsp;
the time of R1 so the time isn’t accurate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

34
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,080
but in a real network it’s of course&nbsp;
very important to have accurate time.

35
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,800
Okay, now let’s move on to step 2 and connect to&nbsp;
R1 from PC1 using Telnet. I’ve already configured&nbsp;&nbsp;

36
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,000
R1 to allow Telnet connections, and I won’t cover&nbsp;
those configurations in this video. I’ll cover&nbsp;&nbsp;

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,960
Telnet and SSH in a later video, perhaps the&nbsp;
next one. So, to Telnet to R1 we must open the&nbsp;&nbsp;

38
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:46,240
command prompt of PC1. Then from here use the&nbsp;
command TELNET, followed by R1’s IP address,&nbsp;&nbsp;

39
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:53,440
192.168.1.1. And now we’ve connected and can&nbsp;
login, then ENABLE and enter the password.&nbsp;&nbsp;

40
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:02,320
Okay, so let’s enable another interface and see&nbsp;
if a log message appears. CONF T. INTERFACE G0/1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

41
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,120
NO SHUTDOWN. And no message appears. That’s&nbsp;
because log messages aren’t displayed by default&nbsp;&nbsp;

42
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:16,080
when connecting via the VTY lines. So, let’s&nbsp;
enable it. By the way, the LOGGING MONITOR command&nbsp;&nbsp;

43
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,760
isn’t actually available in packet tracer, but if&nbsp;
we enable logging for the current Telnet session,&nbsp;&nbsp;

44
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:27,040
it will be enabled automatically. So, what’s the&nbsp;
command to enable logging to the VTY lines for&nbsp;&nbsp;

45
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,400
the current session? It’s TERMINAL MONITOR&nbsp;
from privileged exec mode, but I can use&nbsp;&nbsp;

46
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,560
DO TERMINAL MONITOR to enable it&nbsp;
here from interface config mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;

47
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,240
Okay, now I’ll disable the interface with&nbsp;
SHUTDOWN, and a log message is displayed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

48
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,000
I said in the lecture video that the TERMINAL&nbsp;
MONITOR command only applies to the current&nbsp;&nbsp;

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
session, the current connection. If I exit out&nbsp;
of this Telnet session and then connect again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

50
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,560
the logs shouldn’t display unless I&nbsp;
use the TERMINAL MONITOR command again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

51
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,240
Unfortunately, when I was testing the lab in&nbsp;
packet tracer I found that packet tracer doesn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

52
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,560
function totally accurately. So, even if I exit&nbsp;
out of Telnet and then connect again, log messages&nbsp;&nbsp;

53
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,680
will still display. Don’t worry about that though,&nbsp;
what I taught in the lecture video is correct.

54
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,680
Now let’s do step 3, which is to enable logging&nbsp;
to the buffer. On this router in packet tracer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

55
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,360
logging to the buffer is actually disabled&nbsp;
by default. Let me show you. DO SHOW LOGGING.&nbsp;&nbsp;

56
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,040
Here you can see the logging settings,&nbsp;
and buffer logging is disabled. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

57
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:44,400
let’s enable it. EXIT. LOGGING BUFFERED, and set&nbsp;
the size to 8192 bytes. Now, there is no option

58
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,600
to set the level of messages logged to the buffer&nbsp;
in packet tracer. Let’s check the default level.&nbsp;&nbsp;

59
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,880
DO SHOW LOGGING. Okay, looks like the default&nbsp;
level is DEBUGGING, so all messages will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

60
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,840
saved to the buffer. Also, down here it&nbsp;
says ‘trap logging: level informational’.&nbsp;&nbsp;

61
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,680
So, if a Syslog server is configured, messages&nbsp;
of informational severity or higher will be sent.

62
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,800
Now let’s do step 4, which is to&nbsp;
enable logging to the Syslog server,&nbsp;&nbsp;

63
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,440
SRV1, with a level of debugging. So, I can&nbsp;
use either LOGGING, and then the IP address,&nbsp;&nbsp;

64
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,120
or add HOST and then enter the IP&nbsp;
address, which is 192.168.1.100.&nbsp;&nbsp;

65
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:33,040
So, R1 will now send Syslog messages to SRV1.&nbsp;
But let’s set the severity to debugging. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

66
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:39,120
command is LOGGING TRAP, and the only option in&nbsp;
packet tracer is DEBUGGING, so let’s do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

67
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,520
Okay, now I’ll exit from global config mode. And&nbsp;
actually I’ll generate a few more log messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;

68
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,400
CONF T. I’ll enable G0/1 again.&nbsp;
INTERFACE G0/1. NO SHUTDOWN.&nbsp;&nbsp;

69
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:59,920
And disable it again. SHUTDOWN. And let’s&nbsp;
return to privileged exec mode. END. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

70
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:08,080
that generated a few messages, let’s check on&nbsp;
SRV1. On SRV1, click on Services, and then Syslog.&nbsp;&nbsp;

71
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,200
The Syslog server functionality in Packet&nbsp;
Tracer is very primitive, but here are&nbsp;&nbsp;

72
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,101
the messages that were sent from R1 to SRV1.&nbsp;

73
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,600
Okay, in this lab we did some&nbsp;
basic Syslog configurations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

74
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,760
You probably won’t get any questions about syslog&nbsp;
configuration on the CCNA exam, but I think it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

75
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,560
a good idea to get some hands on practice, even&nbsp;
if it’s limited by packet tracer’s capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

76
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,200
That’s all for this lab. Next let’s take a&nbsp;
look at a bonus lab in Boson Software’s NetSim.

77
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:45,920
Okay here's today's Boson NetSim practice lab. So,&nbsp;
as I have said Syslog configuration is not part of&nbsp;&nbsp;

78
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:53,360
the new CCNA exam, so it's also not part of NetSim&nbsp;
for CCNA. So, for today's demo I've selected a&nbsp;&nbsp;

79
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:01,840
lab from NetSim for ENCOR 350-401, which is the&nbsp;
core exam for the CCNP Enterprise certification.&nbsp;&nbsp;

80
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:10,240
So that lab is system message logging. Although it&nbsp;
is a CCNP practice lab it's actually quite simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;

81
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,360
So here's the topology. A couple routers,&nbsp;
couple switches, and some PCs, and one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

82
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,280
them is a Syslog server. And these are all the&nbsp;
commands you need to know. So, as you can see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

83
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,520
quite simple. You can definitely do this with&nbsp;
the commands I've already taught you. And it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

84
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,560
just a single task with 10 steps, so let's go&nbsp;
through the whole lab for this demonstration.&nbsp;&nbsp;

85
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,640
Okay, first on Router1, ping SyslogServer. The&nbsp;
ping should be successful. Okay let's see if&nbsp;&nbsp;

86
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:51,120
it is in fact successful. PING 10.1.0.10. Okay&nbsp;
and it does work. Okay, configure Router1 to&nbsp;&nbsp;

87
00:08:51,120 --> 00:09:00,960
send system log messages to SyslogServer. Okay,&nbsp;
so CONF T. LOGGING, and I could use LOGGING HOST,&nbsp;&nbsp;

88
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:10,080
or just LOGGING. Both of them have the same&nbsp;
effect. So, 10.1.0.10. That's it. How many&nbsp;&nbsp;

89
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:19,040
levels of logging are available to trap? So, let&nbsp;
me see. DO SHOW LOGGING. Currently, the level is&nbsp;&nbsp;

90
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,520
informational. So, level 6 all the way&nbsp;
down to 0 will be logged to the server.&nbsp;&nbsp;

91
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,080
LOGGING TRAP. How many are&nbsp;
available? Well, all 8 are available,&nbsp;&nbsp;

92
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:39,520
even though only 7 are configured at the moment,&nbsp;
0 through 6. Okay, if you configure a device&nbsp;&nbsp;

93
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:45,440
to trap log messages up to level 7, would you&nbsp;
receive more log messages than if you configured&nbsp;&nbsp;

94
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,960
a device to trap log messages up to level 1?&nbsp;
The answer to that is absolutely yes. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

95
00:09:52,960 --> 00:10:00,320
configured level 1, that includes only level&nbsp;
1, alerts, and level 0, which is emergencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

96
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,960
But if you configured level 7,&nbsp;
that includes all of the levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;

97
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,040
Okay, configure Router1 to limit log messages to&nbsp;
the warning severity level. Okay, so the command&nbsp;&nbsp;

98
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:22,400
is LOGGING TRAP, and then WARNINGS. And let me&nbsp;
verify that, that is step 6. DO SHOW LOGGING.&nbsp;&nbsp;

99
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,320
And here it is. Trap logging level warnings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

100
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,400
Okay, on Switch1 and Switch2, ping&nbsp;
SyslogServer. Okay, let's see if both&nbsp;&nbsp;

101
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,800
switches have connectivity. So I guess these&nbsp;
switches have an IP address maybe on VLAN1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

102
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:51,920
No, it's VLAN99, they have an IP address.&nbsp;
Okay, so let's try that. PING 10.1.0.10, okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

103
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,520
that works. And from ping...not&nbsp;
ping2, from server2 (*Switch2~!!).&nbsp;&nbsp;

104
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,760
Okay. So we are going to do the same&nbsp;
configurations on these switches. Configure&nbsp;&nbsp;

105
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,480
them to send Syslog messages to the server, with&nbsp;
a level of warning or higher. And higher means&nbsp;&nbsp;

106
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,520
higher severity, not higher number, because the&nbsp;
higher severities are actually lower in number.&nbsp;&nbsp;

107
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:28,880
So I'll do it here on Switch2. LOGGING&nbsp;
10.1.0.10. LOGGING TRAP WARNINGS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

108
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:42,880
And Switch1. LOGGING 10.1.0.10. LOGGING TRAP&nbsp;
WARNINGS. Okay, and verify the configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;

109
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,280
DO SHOW LOGGING. We've already got a bunch&nbsp;
of messages here, that is in the buffer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

110
00:11:51,600 --> 00:12:00,560
Okay, the level is warnings, looks good.&nbsp;
Switch2, again trap logging level warnings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

111
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,360
Okay, so that's it, pretty quick and simple&nbsp;
lab. And since we've done the whole lab&nbsp;&nbsp;

112
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,520
let's see if we did it correctly. So, I'll use&nbsp;
the grade lab function here and we'll check&nbsp;&nbsp;

113
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
our configurations to see if they are correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;

114
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:23,360
Okay, looks good. So, all green check marks&nbsp;
are here, so no mistakes. If we had any&nbsp;&nbsp;

115
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,040
missing commands they would be highlighted.&nbsp;
They would be shown here, but highlighted in&nbsp;&nbsp;

116
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,000
red. And if we had any extra commands that we&nbsp;
didn't need they would be highlighted in blue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

117
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,320
Okay, so that was a quick look at Boson&nbsp;
NetSim. This time not for CCNA but for CCNP.&nbsp;&nbsp;

118
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,240
This is a great source of detailed, guided&nbsp;
practice labs for the CCNA and for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

119
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,800
CCNP. If you want to get NetSim, please&nbsp;
