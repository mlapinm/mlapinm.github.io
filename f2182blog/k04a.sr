welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer
00:04
practice lab you can download the lab
00:07
file from the link in the description in
00:09
this lab we will be working with two
00:12
routers r1 and r2 and two switches
00:16
switch 1 and switch 2 we will configure
00:20
and test a serial connection between the
00:22
two routers note that I have already
00:24
configured the host names of each of the
00:26
devices beforehand try to complete the
00:30
lab yourself first then continue
00:32
watching this video if you have trouble
00:33
or watch after to check your solution
00:38
step one asks us to use CVP to discover
00:42
which interfaces are used to connect the
00:44
routers and switches if you have the
00:47
option always show port labels and
00:49
logical workspace in the Preferences
00:51
menu of packet tracer enabled the labels
00:54
will appear next to the devices but I
00:56
have this option turned off we will use
00:59
CDP or Cisco discovery protocol to
01:03
identify the interfaces CDP is a very
01:07
useful tool and I will create a lab
01:09
dedicated to using CDP in the future but
01:12
for this lab all we need to know is one
01:14
command that is show CDP neighbors let's
01:19
give it a try on switch one first I'll
01:22
type in able to enter privileged exec
01:24
mode this is where we use the command
01:28
show CDP neighbors as you can see switch
01:33
1 is connected to r1 and the local
01:35
interface meaning the interface on this
01:38
device is fastethernet 0/1 let's go to
01:42
r1 enable show CDP neighbors our one is
01:49
connected to switch 1 on the Fast
01:51
Ethernet 0 interface but something's
01:54
missing where's our - well because I
01:59
have linked lights enabled on packet
02:00
tracer you might have noticed something
02:02
is wrong let's troubleshoot a little bit
02:05
think of potential causes first at layer
02:08
1 or the physical layer of the OSI model
02:11
is the cable plugged in
02:14
yes it is as you can see here in packet
02:17
tracer are the interfaces turned on
02:19
let's check I'll use the show IP
02:24
interface brief command to check well we
02:28
were going to use CDP to discover which
02:30
interface r1 is connected to are to
02:32
through but as we can see there is only
02:35
one serial interface serial zero and
02:38
it's administrative lead Ã¡own that means
02:42
if we do a show run command which I will
02:45
do now we should see the shutdown
02:47
command on the serial interface
02:49
I didn't configure this this is by
02:52
default let's fix that conf
02:57
no shutdown let's check on our to also
03:02
enable show IP interface brief again it
03:07
is shutdown conf T interface serial zero
03:12
no shutdown okay
03:15
now let's return to r1 this can take
03:19
some time but if I enter show CDP
03:22
neighbors again I should see our - there
03:27
it is
03:27
r1 is connected to our - through the
03:30
serial zero interface let's run the
03:33
command on our to type end to return to
03:38
privileged exec mode show CDP neighbors
03:48
- is also connected to r1 through the
03:51
serial zero interface and switch -
03:53
through the Fast Ethernet zero interface
03:56
finally let's move on to switch to
04:02
enable show CDP neighbors as you can see
04:07
switch 2 is connected to R 2 through the
04:10
Fast Ethernet 0-1 interface step 1 is
04:14
now complete
04:19
step2 asks us to identify which end of
04:22
the serial connection is DCE
04:24
and which end is DTE in serial
04:28
connections one side is DCE
04:30
or data communications equipment and one
04:32
side is DTE or data terminal equipment
04:36
the most important difference between
04:38
the two is that the DCE device supplies
04:41
the clock signal that paces the
04:43
communications which will adjust in the
04:45
next step to identify which is which
04:48
let's go to r1 first we'll use the
04:52
command show controllers serial zero if
04:56
we just type show controllers we would
04:59
be overwhelmed with information about
05:00
every interface on the router so make
05:03
sure to specify serial zero can you find
05:07
what we're looking for there it is and
05:10
this side is the DCE
05:12
you can also see the clock rate
05:15
mentioned earlier well now I know which
05:18
side is DC e that means R 2 should be
05:22
DTE but let's check anyway
05:25
let's hop onto our to show controllers
05:29
serial zero as expected R 2 is DTE step
05:35
two is now complete
05:38
for step three we have to set the clock
05:41
rate on the DCE end to 64 kilobits per
05:44
second so let's go back to our one we
05:49
have to configure the serial zero
05:50
interface so compte then interface
05:55
serial zero now we are in interface
05:58
configuration mode the clock rate is set
06:02
with the clock rate command let's use
06:05
the question mark to see what options we
06:06
have as you can see here these options
06:10
are listed in bits per second our task
06:13
is to set the speed to 64 kilobits per
06:16
second which is 64,000 bits per second
06:20
so let's do that that's all for step
06:23
three we don't have to do anything on
06:25
the DTE side step four tells us to set
06:29
the IP addresses of the serial
06:31
interfaces of r1 and r2 to 192.168.1 /
06:38
24 and 192.168 to
06:45
interface configuration mode on r1 so
06:49
let's configure r1 IP address
06:52
192.168.1.1 at him this is something you
07:03
should know if not don't worry about it
07:06
it's 255.255.255.0 there we go now let's
07:12
do the same on r2 conf t interface
07:18
serial zero IP address 192.168.0.0
07:27
that's all for step four
07:31
finally Step five asks us to test
07:34
connectivity between the routers since
07:37
we're already on our - let's do it from
07:39
here type end to return to privileged
07:42
exec mode the IP address of our one
07:45
serial zero interface is 192.168.0.1 so
07:50
ping 192.168.0.1 as you can see we have
07:56
connectivity between the routers that's
07:58
