19.711770
in this lab we will take a look at the point-to-point protocol PPP
25.564124
PPP is a layer 2 protocol often used over serial LAN or wide area network connections
34.241645
on a Cisco router the default layer 2 encapsulation on a serial connection is Cisco hdl-c
42.681853
however PPP provides superior security through authentication functionality
49.804457
so in this lab we will configure PPP with two different authentication methods
55.834499
on the connection between r1 and SPR one
59.891353
meaning service provider router 1
62.881853
we will configure PPP with PAP the password authentication protocol
68.136582
which uses a static password to authenticate the connection
71.731665
on the connection between r2 and SPR 2
76.694290
we will configure PPP with chap the challenge handshake authentication protocol
81.864186
which uses a dynamic randomly generated string
85.613998
providing greater security than a static never changing password
89.415623
let's get started
91.034644
let's start with r1
93.060352
enable first let's check what the encapsulation on s00 is
100.588311
show interfaces s0 0
103.691519
there it is encapsulation hdl-c
109.564165
also notice that the interface is in the up-down State
113.819061
this is because there is an encapsulation mismatch
117.426894
I've already configured the service provider routers
120.726352
and SPR ones s00 interface is already configured with PPP encapsulation
127.222893
let's try to ping SPR 1
130.697956
ping 100 0.1
134.340498
doesn't work
139.857643
let's enable PPP on our one
142.716393
coffee tea interface s 0 0
147.385143
encapsulation PPP
150.207455
do show IP interface brief
153.180372
now the interface is still up down
156.852413
because we haven't configured authentication yet on our one
160.295371
but it's already configured on SPR one
162.742350
I've already configured a username of Cisco
167.249892
and a password of CCNA on SP r1
169.987142
so we have to configure our one to send that username and password to SP r1 to authenticate
176.019142
likewise SP r 1 is currently trying to authenticate with the username of packet
182.724913
and a password of tracer
184.400371
so we have to configure that username and password on r1
187.869621
I'll do that first
190.976100
exit username packet password tracer
196.042267
now let's go back to the interface
198.770975
interface s0 0
201.456350
ok next let's enable authentication
205.464600
PPP authentication PAP
208.848079
now let's configure it to send the username of Cisco and password of CCNA to SPR 1
215.915517
PPP PAP sent - username Cisco password CCNA
224.454996
now it can take a little time for the interface to come up so I'll reset it to speed things up
230.421204
shutdown no shutdown
233.698287
and I'll wait a few seconds just in case
236.878974
okay let's check
241.532391
do show IP interface brief
243.817204
great now the interface is up up
248.293787
let's see if we can ping SPR one
250.588641
do ping 100 0 1
254.905411
okay now it works
260.892349
so to summarize PPP with pap
265.023599
first you must configure a username and password on your router
269.613557
which the router on the other end will use to authenticate
273.091057
then you must configure the encapsulation of PPP on the interface with the command encapsulation PPP
281.185349
then you enable PAP authentication with PPP authentication PAP
287.126786
then you configure your router to send a username and password to the other router with a PPP PAP
295.116745
sent to username password command
297.968474
of course the road around the other end must have that username and password configured on it
303.202536
in this lab I pre-configured the username of Cisco and password of CCNA on SPR 1
309.890140
next let's configure PPP with chap authentication on our -
316.611473
once again chap is more secure than PAP because it uses dynamic randomly generated strings for each authentication
325.426556
rather than a static password
327.902160
however you still have to configure a username and password on the router
332.396473
which is then used to generate the string
334.587910
so let's go on our to
337.369180
enable show interfaces s0 0
344.243305
just like on r1 before
347.897284
the default encapsulation is hdl-c
350.753867
and the interface is in an up-down state
354.298492
because the SPR 2 router has already been configured to use PPP with chap
359.343825
let's see if we can ping SPR to
362.062221
ping 200 oh you won
365.489304
as expected it doesn't work
371.607158
conf T
374.014012
now let's create the user name and password required for a chap
377.691074
the instructions say to use a password of CCNA
381.742283
but what username should we use
383.729137
the answer is that we must use the other routers host name
388.817720
in this case that is SPR two
392.287304
so username SPR two password CCNA
399.282116
this password has to match between the two routers
403.280449
so I've already configured username our two passwords CCNA on the service provider side
409.429824
for the CCNA routing and switching you don't have to worry about the service provider end
414.689199
that's for the service provider track of certifications
418.110615
now let's configure the interface
421.640489
interface s0 0
424.604447
let's set it down while we do the configurations and then bring it back up when we're done
430.076280
shutdown
431.457738
set the encapsulation dat PPP like on our 1
435.803613
encapsulation PPP
438.527738
now we only have one more command
441.961113
PPP authentication chap
445.628280
that's it
448.073613
let's enable the interface
449.768009
no shutdown
451.181217
ok and now let's check the status of the interface
455.575342
do show IP interface brief
459.140446
the interface is up up
462.115988
now let's try to ping the service provider
465.257634
do ping 200 0.1
469.896488
okay it works now
474.358800
I've already configured static default routes to the service provider
478.933487
as you would often do in a real enterprise network
481.572841
so let's see if we can ping r1 on the other side
484.945070
do ping 100 oh oh -
491.073923
and it works as well
493.560152
so to review PPP with chap
497.072986
you must configure a user on the router with a username that is the other routers hostname
503.254507
in this case SP r2
505.945486
and the password must be the same on both routers
509.780694
then enable PPP on the interface with the encapsulation PPP command
516.063694
and enable chap authentication with PPP authentication chap
521.668964
that's all for this lab
