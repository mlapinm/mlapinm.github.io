lab we will take a look at the

point-to-point protocol PPP PPP

is a layer 2 protocol often used over

serial LAN or wide area network

connections on a Cisco router the

default layer 2 encapsulation on a

serial connection is Cisco hdl-c however

PPP provides superior security through

authentication functionality so in this

lab we will configure PPP with two

different authentication methods on the

connection between r1 and SPR one

meaning service provider router 1 we

will configure PPP with PAP the password

authentication protocol which uses a

static password to authenticate the

connection on the connection between r2

and SPR 2 we will configure PPP with

chap the challenge handshake

authentication protocol which uses a

dynamic randomly generated string

providing greater security than a static

never changing password let's get

started let's start with r1 enable first

let's check what the encapsulation on

s00 is show interfaces s0 0 there it is

encapsulation hdl-c

also notice that the interface is in the

up-down State this is because there is

an encapsulation mismatch I've already

configured the service provider routers

and SPR ones s00 interface is already

configured with PPP encapsulation

let's try to ping SPR 1 ping 100 0.1

doesn't work let's enable PPP on our one

coffee tea interface s 0 0 encapsulation

PPP do show IP interface brief now the

interface is still up down because we

haven't configured authentication yet on

our one but it's already configured on

SPR one I've already configured a

username of Cisco and a password of CCNA

on SP r1 so we have to configure our one

to send that username and password to SP

r1 to authenticate likewise SP r 1 is

currently trying to authenticate with

the username of packet and a password of

tracer so we have to configure that

username and password on r1 I'll do that

first exit username packet password

tracer now let's go back to the

interface interface s0 0 ok next let's

enable authentication PPP authentication

PAP now let's configure it to send the

username of Cisco and password of CCNA

to SPR 1 PPP PAP sent - username Cisco

password CCNA now it can take a little

time for the interface to come up so

I'll reset it to speed things up

shutdown no shutdown and I'll wait a few

seconds just in case okay let's check do

show IP interface brief great now the

interface is up up let's see if we can

ping SPR one do ping 100 0 1

okay now it works

so to summarize PPP with pap first you

must configure a username and password

on your router which the router on the

other end will use to authenticate then

you must configure the encapsulation of

PPP on the interface with the command

encapsulation PPP then you enable PAP

authentication with PPP authentication

PAP then you configure your router to

send a username and password to the

other router with a PPP PAP sent to

username password command of course the

road around the other end must have that

username and password configured on it

in this lab I pre-configured the

username of Cisco and password of CCNA

on SPR 1 next let's configure PPP with

chap authentication on our - once again

chap is more secure than PAP because it

uses dynamic randomly generated strings

for each authentication rather than a

static password however you still have

to configure a username and password on

the router which is then used to

generate the string so let's go on our

to enable show interfaces s0 0 just like

on r1 before the default encapsulation

is hdl-c and the interface is in an

up-down state because the SPR 2 router

has already been configured to use PPP

with chap let's see if we can ping SPR

to ping 200 oh you won

as expected it doesn't work

conf T now let's create the user name

and password required for a chap the

instructions say to use a password of

CCNA but what username should we use the

answer is that we must use the other

routers host name in this case that is

SPR two so username SPR two password

CCNA this password has to match between

the two routers so I've already

configured username our two passwords

CCNA on the service provider side for

the CCNA routing and switching you don't

have to worry about the service provider

end that's for the service provider

track of certifications now let's

configure the interface interface s0 0

let's set it down while we do the

configurations and then bring it back up

when we're done

shutdown set the encapsulation dat PPP

like on our 1 encapsulation PPP now we

only have one more command PPP

authentication chap that's it let's

enable the interface no shutdown ok and

now let's check the status of the

interface do show IP interface brief

the interface is up up now let's try to

ping the service provider do ping 200

0.1 okay it works now I've already

configured static default routes to the

service provider as you would often do

in a real enterprise network so let's

see if we can ping r1 on the other side

do ping 100 oh oh - and it works as well

so to review PPP with chap you must

configure a user on the router with a

username that is the other routers

hostname in this case SP r2 and the

password must be the same on both

routers then enable PPP on the interface

with the encapsulation PPP command and

enable chap authentication with PPP

authentication chap that's all for this
