8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,560
It’s a network simulator like packet tracer, but&nbsp;
it’s even better, and it includes all of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,120
guided labs to not only help you get hands-on&nbsp;
practice configuring and troubleshooting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,560
but also deepen your understanding of the exam&nbsp;
topics. I used it myself when studying for my&nbsp;&nbsp;

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,400
certifications, so I feel confident&nbsp;
about recommending it to all of you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,920
In today’s video we’ll try a few&nbsp;
methods of configuring IPv6 addresses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,200
as well as IPv6 static routes. We&nbsp;
haven’t covered IPv6 static routes yet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,280
but using the context-sensitive help&nbsp;
in IOS you’ll be able to figure it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:23,040
Step 1 says to use EUI-64 to configure the&nbsp;
appropriate IPv6 address on the G0/1 interface of&nbsp;&nbsp;

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,640
R1 and R2. But before actually configuring&nbsp;
the addresses, we should examine the MAC&nbsp;&nbsp;

18
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,160
address of each interface and calculate the&nbsp;
EUI-64 interface ID that will be configured.

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:43,680
So let’s do that on R1 first. ENABLE. To&nbsp;
check the MAC address of an interface,&nbsp;&nbsp;

20
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,240
use SHOW INTERFACES G0/1. Up here near the&nbsp;
top of the output you can see the MAC address.&nbsp;&nbsp;

21
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,480
So, let’s calculate the EUI-64 interface ID,&nbsp;
and the IPv6 address that will be configured.&nbsp;&nbsp;

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,680
In this document I’ve written out&nbsp;
the process. Here’s the MAC address.&nbsp;&nbsp;

23
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,040
Split it in half, and then insert FFFE in&nbsp;
the middle. Finally, invert the 7th bit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

24
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:16,080
which makes the 0 a 2. That’s the EUI-64&nbsp;
interface ID. Add the network prefix, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

25
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,400
this is the IPv6 address that will be configured&nbsp;
on R1’s G0/1 interface. So, let’s configure it.

26
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,080
Back to R1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

27
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,480
CONF T. Before configuring the interface, I should&nbsp;
enable IPv6 routing, since we’ll try out some&nbsp;&nbsp;

28
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:42,560
pings later. IPV6 UNICAST-ROUTING. Okay, now let’s&nbsp;
configure the interface. INTERFACE G0/1. IPV6&nbsp;&nbsp;

29
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:52,960
ADDRESS 2001:db8::/64, that’s the network prefix.&nbsp;
Finally just add EUI-64 to the end. Okay, let’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

30
00:02:52,960 --> 00:03:00,560
check the address that was configured. DO SHOW&nbsp;
IPV6 INTERFACE BRIEF. There it is. Notice that&nbsp;&nbsp;

31
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,200
a link-local address was automatically configured&nbsp;
also, and it uses the same EUI-64 interface ID,&nbsp;&nbsp;

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,400
but a different network prefix, beginning&nbsp;
with FE80 because it’s a link-local address.

33
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,840
Now let’s do the same process on R2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

34
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:27,840
ENABLE. SHOW INTERFACES G0/1. Here is the MAC&nbsp;
address of G0/1. Let’s return to that document.&nbsp;&nbsp;

35
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:36,160
Here is that same MAC address. To get the EUI-64&nbsp;
interface ID, split it in half, insert FFFE in&nbsp;&nbsp;

36
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:44,000
the middle, and finally invert the 7th bit.&nbsp;
That’s the EUI-64 interface ID. If you add the&nbsp;&nbsp;

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,440
network prefix to it, you get the IPv6 address&nbsp;
that will be configured on R2’s G0/1 interface.

38
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:58,400
Let’s go back to the CLI of R2. CONF T.&nbsp;
Once again, let’s enable IPv6 routing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

39
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,160
IPV6 UNICAST-ROUTING. Now let’s&nbsp;
configure the interface. INTERFACE G0/1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

40
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:19,760
IPV6 ADDRESS 2001:db8:0:1::/64 EUI-64. Okay, let’s&nbsp;
check the address. DO SHOW IPV6 INTERFACE BRIEF.&nbsp;&nbsp;

41
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,920
There it is, and a link-local&nbsp;
address was configured, too.

42
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,080
In step 2 we are told to configure the appropriate&nbsp;
IPv6 address and default gateway on PC1 and PC2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

43
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,080
Since we’re already on R2, I’m going to copy the&nbsp;
address we just configured, because this will&nbsp;&nbsp;

44
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:47,680
be PC2’s default gateway. Now let’s go on PC2.&nbsp;
First, we must enter the default gateway here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

45
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,280
I’ll paste in R2’s address. Now&nbsp;
let’s configure PC2’s own address.&nbsp;&nbsp;

46
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:04,800
It’s 2001:db8:0:1::2, with a /64 prefix length.&nbsp;
Notice that it already has a link-local address,&nbsp;&nbsp;

47
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,840
based off of the MAC address which you&nbsp;
can see up here. Okay, that’s all for PC2.

48
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,880
Now I’ll return to R1. Let me copy the&nbsp;
IPv6 address of its G0/1 interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;

49
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,920
Now I’ll configure PC1. First, I’ll paste&nbsp;
R1’s IP address as the default gateway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

50
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:37,840
Next I’ll configure PC1’s address,&nbsp;
2001:db8::2/64. Okay, that’s all for step 2.

51
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,160
Step 3 says to enable IPv6 on&nbsp;
the G0/0 interface of R1 and R2,&nbsp;&nbsp;

52
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,600
without explicitly configuring an IPv6&nbsp;
address on them. I’ll do that on R1 first.&nbsp;&nbsp;

53
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,400
INTERFACE G0/0. To enable IPv6 on an&nbsp;
interface, use this command, IPV6 ENABLE.&nbsp;&nbsp;

54
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,640
That’s it. That will automatically configure&nbsp;
an IPv6 address on the interface. What kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

55
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:12,320
of IPv6 address? It’s a link-local address.&nbsp;
Let’s check. DO SHOW IPV6 INTERFACE BRIEF.&nbsp;&nbsp;

56
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,120
There it is, and notice the EUI-64 interface ID&nbsp;&nbsp;

57
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,200
is different than G0/1’s, because the&nbsp;
interfaces have different MAC addresses.

58
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:32,480
Okay, next I’ll do the same on R2. INTERFACE&nbsp;
G0/0. IPV6 ENABLE. Let’s see the address that was&nbsp;&nbsp;

59
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:42,160
configured. DO SHOW IPV6 INTERFACE BRIEF. There it&nbsp;
is, a link-local IPv6 address beginning with FE80.

60
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,320
Finally, step 4 says to configure static&nbsp;
routes on R1 and R2 to enable PC1 to ping PC2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

61
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,200
We’ll cover IPv6 static routes in day 33,&nbsp;
but let’s get a little preview. There are&nbsp;&nbsp;

62
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,080
multiple ways to configure this, for example we&nbsp;
could configure a default route on each router,&nbsp;&nbsp;

63
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,600
but I’ll just configure a route to each specific&nbsp;
subnet. First, let me copy the link-local address&nbsp;&nbsp;

64
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:15,840
that was just configured here on R2, I’ll use it&nbsp;
as the next-hop for R1’s route. Now I’ll go on R1.

65
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,680
Let me EXIT back to global config mode. The&nbsp;
command to configure an IPv6 static route is&nbsp;&nbsp;

66
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,840
IPV6 ROUTE, now I’ll use the context-sensitive&nbsp;
help, the question mark, to see what’s next.&nbsp;&nbsp;

67
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:39,349
Just like in IPv4 routes, we have to configure&nbsp;
the destination. That is 2001:db8:0:1::/64.&nbsp;&nbsp;

68
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,360
Now let’s see what’s next. So, we can configure an&nbsp;
exit interface or the next hop. I’ll set the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

69
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:54,000
hop as the link-local address of R2 by pasting it&nbsp;
here. Okay, let’s try to enter the command. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

70
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,040
an error message is displayed. Interface has to be&nbsp;
specified for a link-local nexthop. So, when using&nbsp;&nbsp;

71
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,000
a link-local address as a next-hop, you can’t&nbsp;
just specify the address. You have to specify&nbsp;&nbsp;

72
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,080
the interface, too. If I use the context-sensitive&nbsp;
help, you’ll see that I can’t enter the interface&nbsp;&nbsp;

73
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:19,520
here. So, I need to put it before the next-hop.&nbsp;
Okay, so that’s the route here on R1. Now I’ll&nbsp;&nbsp;

74
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,840
scroll up and copy the link-local address of R1’s&nbsp;
interface, so I can use it as the next hop on R2.

75
00:08:27,393 --> 00:08:36,880
Now let’s configure the route on&nbsp;
R2. EXIT. IPV6 ROUTE 2001:db8::/64,&nbsp;&nbsp;

76
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,240
then the exit interface, G0/0. Finally&nbsp;
I’ll paste in R1’s link-local address.&nbsp;&nbsp;

77
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,920
Okay, that’s all. So, let’s test out&nbsp;
these routes by pinging from PC1 to PC2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

78
00:08:52,400 --> 00:09:02,800
PING 2001:db8:0:1::2. Okay,&nbsp;
PC1 is able to reach PC2.

79
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:12,320
So, in this lab we configured IPv6 addresses using&nbsp;
IPV6 ADDRESS EUI-64, enabled IPv6 on interfaces&nbsp;&nbsp;

80
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,960
without manually configuring an address, and then&nbsp;
tried out IPv6 static routes. In Day 33 we’ll go&nbsp;&nbsp;

81
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:25,040
in depth about IPv6 static routing. Now let’s&nbsp;
take a look at a lab in Boson NetSim for CCNA.

82
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,720
Okay, here's today's Boson NetSim lab preview.&nbsp;
The lab we're doing today is Configuring&nbsp;&nbsp;

83
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,600
IPv6 1. Here's the objective. Understand and&nbsp;
implement IPv6 addressing on the network,&nbsp;&nbsp;

84
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:47,200
and implement RIPng to implement dynamic&nbsp;
IPv6 routing. Now, dynamic routing in IPv6&nbsp;&nbsp;

85
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,680
isn't actually in the CCNA exam topics, but&nbsp;
let's take a quick look at it in this lab.&nbsp;&nbsp;

86
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,120
All of the commands you need to know&nbsp;
are listed here. IPv6 ROUTER RIP,&nbsp;&nbsp;

87
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,840
IPv6 RIP ENABLE. So you can complete this lab&nbsp;
even if you haven't actually studied RIPng yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

88
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,720
Here are the IP addresses currently configured.&nbsp;
As you can see, IPv4 is already enabled on&nbsp;&nbsp;

89
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,040
the network. We're going to add IPv6 on&nbsp;
top of that. And the lab tasks. Task 1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

90
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:24,720
examine the initial network configuration.&nbsp;
Task 2, explore IPv6. Task 3, implement IPv6.&nbsp;&nbsp;

91
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,480
And finally task 4, verify IPv6.&nbsp;
So this is a pretty big lab.&nbsp;&nbsp;

92
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,240
For this lab preview, let's just do task 3,&nbsp;
implement IPv6. So let's do some configurations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

93
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:46,400
So part A, implement IPv6 addressing, step&nbsp;
1. You will implement IPv6 addressing on&nbsp;&nbsp;

94
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,960
the WAN links that connect the Tampa,&nbsp;
Orlando, Daytona, and Miami routers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

95
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,880
Okay, so these four routers, just these&nbsp;
WAN links. You will not implement IPv6&nbsp;&nbsp;

96
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,960
addressing on the WAN link that connects the&nbsp;
Miami and Key West routers or on the LANs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

97
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,480
Okay, and this diagram and the table show&nbsp;
the IPv6 addresses we will configure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

98
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,720
Okay, review the commands used to assign&nbsp;
an IPv6 address to an interface. Compare&nbsp;&nbsp;

99
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,960
these commands to the commands you currently&nbsp;
use to assign IP addresses to an interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;

100
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,720
So this means, the commands you&nbsp;
currently use refers to IPv4 addressing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

101
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:32,400
And the commands are quite similar. IPv4&nbsp;
uses IP ADDRESS, IPv6 uses IPv6 ADDRESS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

102
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,600
And most commands are like that, they're&nbsp;
almost identical between IPv4 and IPv6,&nbsp;&nbsp;

103
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:46,400
but for IPv6 instead of IP you have to enter&nbsp;
IPv6. Okay, on Tampa, Orlando, Daytona, and Miami,&nbsp;&nbsp;

104
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:53,120
enable IPv6 routing. Okay, let's do that. Here on&nbsp;
Tampa, oh that's right there's a password on these&nbsp;&nbsp;

105
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:04,800
routers. Okay, the console password is admin, and&nbsp;
the enable password is cisco, okay. Admin, enable,&nbsp;&nbsp;

106
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:15,920
cisco. And let's configure IPv6 routing. Okay,&nbsp;
that's it for Tampa. Next up, Orlando. Admin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

107
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,880
Okay, that's all for Orlando. We aren't&nbsp;
configuring it on Key West, so I'll go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

108
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:42,320
Daytona next. Admin, enable, cisco. IPv6&nbsp;
unicast-routing. And finally the Miami router.&nbsp;&nbsp;

109
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,840
Okay, so let's see what's next.&nbsp;&nbsp;

110
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,440
On Tampa, Orlando, Daytona, and Miami, assign&nbsp;
the appropriate IPv6 addresses. Refer to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

111
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,840
IPv6 addresses table. Okay, so we will configure&nbsp;
those addresses. I'm on Miami, so I'll start here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

112
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:21,126
First, interface serial0/0. IPv6 address&nbsp;
2001:0:1:3::2/64. Next, serial0/1. IPv6 address&nbsp;&nbsp;

113
00:13:21,126 --> 00:13:33,785
2001:0:1:2::1/64. Alright, next I'll go to&nbsp;
Daytona. Interface serial0/0. IPv6 address&nbsp;&nbsp;

114
00:13:33,785 --> 00:13:56,480
2001:0:1:0::2/64. Interface serial0/1. IPv6&nbsp;
address 2001:0:1:2::2/64. Okay next up, Orlando.&nbsp;&nbsp;

115
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:09,840
Interface serial0/0. IPv6 address&nbsp;
2001:0:1:1::2/64. Next up, serial0/1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

116
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,680
Okay, last one is Tampa. Serial0/0.&nbsp;&nbsp;

117
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:39,840
And serial0/1. Okay, that's it.&nbsp;
Next, implement IPv6 routing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

118
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:47,440
So this is what we haven't covered and it actually&nbsp;
isn't on the CCNA exam, but it's good to know. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

119
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,280
step 1. Updated routing protocols capable of 
working with IPv6 addresses must be used in&nbsp;&nbsp;

120
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,320
order for IPv6 routes to be exchanged with&nbsp;
other routers. You will implement RIPng,&nbsp;&nbsp;

121
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,240
RIP next generation, in this lab. RIPng&nbsp;
can function with IPv6 addresses, okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

122
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:11,520
Number 2, identify the commands you should issue&nbsp;
to enable IPv6 dynamic routing with RIPng. How do&nbsp;&nbsp;

123
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,160
these commands differ from the commands you would&nbsp;
issue to configure interfaces for RIP with IPv4?&nbsp;&nbsp;

124
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,280
And then we will configure&nbsp;
RIPng on the four routers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

125
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,800
and use boson as the process identification&nbsp;
string. So, you can see those commands up here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

126
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:38,080
We need to know just two commands. IPv6&nbsp;
ROUTER RIP (process-name). This enables RIPng&nbsp;&nbsp;

127
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:44,320
on the router. And the big difference&nbsp;
here is the process name. So, in IPv4,&nbsp;&nbsp;

128
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,240
you could only have one RIP process running&nbsp;
at a time. You would use the command ROUTER RIP,&nbsp;&nbsp;

129
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,480
and then you would enable RIP on the&nbsp;
interfaces with the NETWORK command.&nbsp;&nbsp;

130
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:02,080
However, in RIPng, you enable RIPng&nbsp;
directly on the interfaces with IPv6 RIP,&nbsp;&nbsp;

131
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,840
followed by the process name, followed by&nbsp;
ENABLE. Okay, so I'll start here on Tampa.&nbsp;&nbsp;

132
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,920
Now, I believe that we could just&nbsp;
enable it directly on the interfaces&nbsp;&nbsp;

133
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,840
and the process will be automatically&nbsp;
created, so we don't have to use this&nbsp;&nbsp;

134
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:25,200
IPv6 ROUTER RIP command. Let's see if I'm correct&nbsp;
about that. INTERFACE RANGE SERIAL0/0 - 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

135
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,480
Oh, I can't use the interface range command,&nbsp;
alright. So, interface serial0/0. That&nbsp;&nbsp;

136
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:40,160
might be something in NetSim, I'm not sure&nbsp;
about that. Interface serial0/0, IPv6 rip,&nbsp;&nbsp;

137
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:47,680
and the process name, it said to use boson, and&nbsp;
then enable. And then I'll do that on serial0/1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

138
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:58,640
Use the up arrow to use the same command.&nbsp;
Okay, now let's see if RIPng was enabled&nbsp;&nbsp;

139
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:09,360
by configuring it on the interfaces. SHOW&nbsp;
IPV6 PROTOCOLS...'protols'...PROTOCOLS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

140
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,680
IPv6 routing protocol is 'rip boson'.&nbsp;
Okay, looks like it's enabled.&nbsp;&nbsp;

141
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:24,800
So, let's do that on the other routers.&nbsp;
Here on Orlando, IPv6 rip boson enable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

142
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:39,840
Interface serial0, IPv6 rip boson enable.&nbsp;
Okay, then Daytona. IPv6 rip boson enable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

143
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:53,520
Interface serial0/0. Ipv6 rip boson enable. And&nbsp;
then Miami. IPv6 rip boson enable. Serial0/0,&nbsp;&nbsp;

144
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:02,320
IPv6 rip boson enable. Okay, so let's see&nbsp;
if they are actually exchanging routes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

145
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:15,280
SHOW IPv6 ROUTE. Okay, looks like Tampa has&nbsp;
learned a RIP route. It might take some more&nbsp;&nbsp;

146
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,400
time for it to learn the other routes.&nbsp;
How about on Orlando? SHOW IPv6 ROUTE.&nbsp;&nbsp;

147
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,120
Yep, we're getting some RIP routes, looks good.&nbsp;&nbsp;

148
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:34,640
How about Daytona? SHOW IPv6 ROUTE. Okay,&nbsp;
same thing here. And Miami, SHOW IPv6 ROUTE.&nbsp;&nbsp;

149
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:42,320
Okay, we're getting RIP routes, looks good. Okay&nbsp;
so to summarize, to configure RIPng, you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

150
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,760
create the process from global config mode with&nbsp;
IPv6 ROUTER RIP, followed by the process name,&nbsp;&nbsp;

151
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,120
and then enable it directly on interfaces&nbsp;
with IPv6 RIP, process-name, ENABLE.&nbsp;&nbsp;

152
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,320
However, if you enable it directly on the&nbsp;
interface, the process is automatically created&nbsp;&nbsp;

153
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:06,480
so you don't actually need to enter this command.&nbsp;
Okay, so I think that's all for that step. Yep,&nbsp;&nbsp;

154
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,040
we just did step 2 and step 3. We enabled RIPng&nbsp;
on the routers and used boson as the process ID.&nbsp;&nbsp;

155
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,120
Okay, next up we would verify our&nbsp;
configurations, verify the addresses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

156
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:25,680
test the pings, but I'll leave it here for today.&nbsp;
Okay, so if you want to get Boson NetSim, follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

157
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,480
the link in the video description. As you can&nbsp;
see, these labs are quite long, quite detailed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

158
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:37,200
much more extensive than my packet tracer labs,&nbsp;
so I highly recommend Boson NetSim for the CCNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

159
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,960
Once again, if you want to get Boson NetSim,&nbsp;
follow the link in the video description.
