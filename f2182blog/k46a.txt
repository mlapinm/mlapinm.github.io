channel for more labs like this 18.159873 in this
lab more colorful than usual we will
configure VLANs and VTP the VLAN
trunking protocol 27.895518 VTP is used to
propagate VLAN configurations among
switches 33.347309 so you can configure the
required VLANs on a single switch and
have it share the configurations with
other switches instead of having to
configure the same VLANs on every
individual switch 45.101975 so the first step is
to configure the switch ports connecting
switches as trunk ports and disable DTP
54.136475 that's simple enough let's go on switch
one 57.398120 enable conf t interface g0 1
switch port mode trunk switch port no
negotiate exit 70.036682 now on switch 2 enable
conf t interface range g0 1 to 2 switch
port mode trunk switch port no negotiate
exit 86.942326 finally on switch 3 enable conf t
interface g0 1 switch port mode trunk
switch port no negotiate exit 101.541180 okay
that's all for step 1 104.279430 step 2 is to
configure switch 2 as VTP transparent
110.121617 first let's review the different VTB
modes 114.171867 there are 3 VTB modes server
client and transparent 119.423971 in this lab
switch 1 will be a server and switch 3
will be a client 126.014992 switch 2 will be in
transparent mode 129.292575 VTP servers are able to
create and delete VLANs
and then share those configurations with
other switches 136.250387 VTP clients cannot create
or delete VLANs but will rather sink
their VLAN configuration with a VTP
server 143.920408 VTP transparent switches will not
sink their VLAN configurations to a
server 150.108554 they will however pass along VTP
messages from VTP servers 155.530804 so in this lab
switch 2 will be in transparent mode 160.025074 and
it's between switch 1 and switch 3 163.152761 it
won't sink its VLANs to switch 1 but it
will pass which ones messages to switch
3 170.028719 okay let's do the configuration 173.431949 first
VTP mode transparent 176.930428 configure switch 2
in VTP transparent mode 179.899323 next the VTP
domain name as you can see here is CCNA
VTP domain CCNA 188.764239 also we are told to
configure VTP version 2 VTP version 2
194.209780 Cisco recommends to avoid using version
1 if possible 201.977405 next let's create VLAN 40
on switch 2 206.106155 VLAN 40 named accounting
exit
211.518425 let's check do show VLAN brief 216.122175 there we
go
VLAN 40 named accounting 220.245363 the next step
is to configure our VTP server switch
1 227.016988 VTP domain CCNA VTP version 2 VTP
mode server 237.316967 VTP server is actually the
default VTV mode by the way 241.442800 ok now let's
create VLANs 10 20 and 30 246.356841 VLAN 10 name
HR VLAN 20 name sales VLAN 30 name
engineering exit
262.918590 next let's configure switch 3 as a VTP
client 268.045090 and it should get all of this
configuration from switch 1 271.098090 VTP mode
client 276.754402 do you show VTP status
280.113444 notice how the VTP version 2 and VTP
domain name of CCNA are already set
without us having to configure them 289.475048 if a
VTP switch with the default domain name
null receives a message from a VTP
switch in another domain 297.855235 it will
automatically join that other switches
domain 300.522339 same thing for the VTP version
303.460214 if a version once which receives a VTP
message from a VTP version 2 switch 308.811256 it
will change to the VTP version 2 if
it's supported on the switch 313.234839 the next
step is to assign all switch ports
connected to hosts to their proper VLANs
and disable VTP 321.521922 this is pretty
repetitive work but let's get into it
326.025255 right here on switch 3 first 329.246567 interface
f01 switch port mode access switch port
access VLAN 10 switch port no negotiate
343.010400 interface range F 0 2 to 3 switch port
mode access switch port access VLAN 30
switch port no negotiate interface F 0 4
switch port mode access switch port
access VLAN 20 switch port no negotiate
371.078649 okay next is switch 2 interface range F
0 1 to 2 switch port mode access switch
port access VLAN 40 switch port no
negotiate 391.129648 finally switch 1
interface range f 0 1 to 2 switch port
mode access switch port access VLAN 10
switch port no negotiate 410.243001 last one
interface F 0 3 switch port mode access
switch port access VLAN 20 switch port
no negotiate 422.932834 okay all done
426.292084 finally we are to configure the Chuck
ports to allow only VLANs 1 10 and 20
432.592021 let's do it here on switch 1 first
interface g0 1 switch port trunk allowed
VLAN 441.948396 now let's check our options
443.661354 this word option allows us to specify a
list of allowed VLANs 448.322020 for example 1 2 3
4 do show interfaces trunk 456.096707 see VLANs 1 2
4 are allowed if I enter the same thing
again with different numbers that list
will be replaced 465.691956 switch port trunk
allowed VLAN 5 6 7 8 471.898539 do show interfaces
trunk 474.326351 c-1 to 4 has been replaced by 5 - 8
478.805454 the next option add adds to the current
list
let's try 483.804349 switch port trunk allowed VLAN
add 9 488.645765 do show interfaces trunk 490.764203 now it's
5 to 9 493.221911 remove does the opposite removing
from the current list 497.332494 for example switch
port trunk allowed VLAN remove 9 502.931307 do show
interfaces trunk 505.450244 now it's five to eight
again 507.975828 all allows all VLANs of course
511.481119 let's try switch port trunk allowed VLAN
all 515.989327 do show interfaces trunk 518.554327 now it's
1-1005 521.626577 we can also do
the opposite with none 524.960931 switch port trunk
allowed VLANs
not
529.030431 do show interfaces trunk 531.286264 now nothing
appears 532.821181 finally there is the accept
option 536.120535 we can allow all VLANs except
certain ones 539.302910 switch port trunk allowed
VLAN except 2 544.525243 do show interfaces trunk
546.777972 now it's 1 & 3 to 1005 550.850805 ok now let's get
back to the task at hand 554.360138 switch port
trunk allowed VLAN 1 10 20 559.771554 do show
interfaces trunk 562.130992 there we go 564.584013 let's do
the same thing on the other switches and
then we're done 567.872179 so next is switch 2
570.548616 interface range G 0 1 to 2 switch port
trunk allowed VLAN 1 10 20 581.460553 finally
switch 3 585.125282 interface G 0 1 switch port
trunk allowed VLAN 1 10 20 592.241490 in this lab
we configured VTP and we also looked at
how to add and remove allowed VLANs on
trunks 600.545803 that's all for this lab 602.367844 thank you
