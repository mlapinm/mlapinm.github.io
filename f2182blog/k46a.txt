channel for more labs like this in this

lab more colorful than usual we will

configure VLANs and VTP the VLAN

trunking protocol VTP is used to

propagate VLAN configurations among

switches so you can configure the

required VLANs on a single switch and

have it share the configurations with

other switches instead of having to

configure the same VLANs on every

individual switch so the first step is

to configure the switch ports connecting

switches as trunk ports and disable DTP

that's simple enough let's go on switch

one enable compte interface g0 one

switch port mode trunk switch port no

negotiate exit now on switch to enable

Conti interface range g0 1 to 2 switch

port mode trunk switch port no negotiate

exit finally on switch 3 enable compte

interface g0 1 switch port mode trunk

switch port no negotiate exit okay

that's all for step 1 step 2 is to

configure switch 2 as VTP transparent

first let's review the different VTB

modes there are 3 VTB modes server

client and transparent in this lab

switch 1 will be a server and switch 3

will be a client switch 2 will be in

transparent mode VTP servers are able to

create and delete VLANs

and then share those configurations with

other switches VTP clients cannot create

or delete VLANs but will rather sink

their VLAN configuration with a VTP

server VTP transparent switches will not

sink their VLAN configurations to a

server they will however pass along VTP

messages from VTP servers so in this lab

switch 2 will be in transparent mode and

it's between switch 1 and switch 3 it

won't sink its VLANs to switch 1 but it

will pass which ones messages to switch

3 okay let's do the configuration first

VTP mode transparent configure switch to

in VTP transparent mode next the VTP

domain name as you can see here is CCNA

VTP domain CCNA also we are told to

configure VTP version 2 VTP version -

Cisco recommends to avoid using version

1 if possible next let's create VLAN 40

on switch to VLAN 40 named accounting

exit

let's check do show VLAN brief there we

go

VLAN 40 named accounting the next step

is to configure our VTP server switch

one VTP domain CCNA VTP version 2 VT P

mode server VT P server is actually the

default VTV mode by the way ok now let's

create VLANs 10 20 and 30 VLAN 10 name

HR VLAN 20 name sales VLAN 30 name

engineering exit

next let's configure switch 3 as a VTP

client and it should get all of this

configuration from switch 1 VT P mode

client do you show VT P status

notice how the VT P version 2 and VT v

domain name of CCNA are already set

without us having to configure them if a

VT P switch with the default domain name

null receives a message from a VT P

switch in another domain it will

automatically join that other switches

domain same thing for the VT P version

if a version once which receives a VT P

message from a VT b version to switch it

will change to the VT p version 2 if

it's supported on the switch the next

step is to assign all switch ports

connected to hosts to their proper VLANs

and disable VT P this is pretty

repetitive work but let's get into it

right here on switch 3 first interface

f01 switch port mode access switch port

access VLAN 10 switch port no negotiate

interface range F 0 2 to 3 switch port

mode access switch port access VLAN 30

switch port no negotiate interface F 0 4

switch port mode access switch port

access VLAN 20 switch port no negotiate

okay next is switch to interface range F

0 1 2 to switch port mode access switch

port access VLAN 40 switch port no

negotiate finally switch 1

interface range f 0 1 2 2 switch port

mode access switch port access VLAN 10

switch port no negotiate last one

interface F 0 3 switch port mode access

switch port access VLAN 20 switch port

no negotiate okay all done

finally we are to configure the Chuck

ports to allow only VLANs 1 10 and 20

let's do it here on switch 1 first

interface g0 1 switch port trunk allowed

VLAN now let's check our options

this word option allows us to specify a

list of allowed VLANs for example 1 2 3

4 do show interfaces trunk see VLANs 1 2

4 are allowed if I enter the same thing

again with different numbers that list

will be replaced switch port trunk

allowed VLAN 5 6 7 8 do show interfaces

trunk c-124 has been replaced by 5 - 8

the next option add adds to the current

list

let's try switch port trunk allowed VLAN

add 9 do show interfaces trunk now it's

5 to 9 remove does the opposite removing

from the current list for example switch

port trunk allowed VLAN remove 9 do show

interfaces trunk now it's five to eighty

game all allows all VLANs of course

let's try switch port trunk allowed VLAN

all do show interfaces trunk now it's

one two one thousand five we can also do

the opposite with none switch port trunk

allowed VLANs

not

do show interfaces trunk now nothing

appears finally there is the accept

option we can allow all VLANs except

certain ones switch port trunk allowed

VLAN except to do show interfaces trunk

now it's 1 & 3 to 1005 ok now let's get

back to the task at hand switch port

trunk allowed VLAN 1 10 20 do show

interfaces trunk there we go let's do

the same thing on the other switches and

then we're done so next is switch to

interface range G 0 1 2 2 switch port

trunk allowed VLAN 1 10 20 finally

switch 3 interface G 0 1 switch port

trunk allowed VLAN 1 10 20 in this lab

we configured VTP and we also looked at

how to add and remove allowed VLANs on

trunks that's all for this lab thank you
