lab we are going to do some important
device management tasks 25.859770 including
password recovery configuration backup
and operating system upgrading 31.634561 first we
are locked out of r one 34.968395 someone else
configured an enable password and forgot
it so we can't enter privileged exec
mode 40.711311 and thus can't enter global
configuration mode to change the
password 44.296061 so how can we solve this 47.181290 we
have to use the rom monitor command line
AKA rahman 51.505540 to enter rahman reset the
router and then press control break
before it finishes booting 59.083165 to do that in
packet tracer click on r1 and under the
physical tab here flick the power switch
off and on then switch to the CLI and
press control break 72.497436 there we are we're
now in ROM on 76.594394 the next step in password
recovery is to change the configuration
register to make r1 startup and ignore
the startup configuration in NVRAM 85.977998 and
startup with a default configuration
88.291102 then we will enter privileged exec mode
without needing a password copy the
startup config to the running config to
make it active and then change the
password and save the configuration
again 100.695352 so to change the configuration
register from rahman use this command
106.972622 conf reg and to make it ignore the
contents of nvram type 0 x2 1 4 2 115.094122 then
type reset to reset the router
118.447309 there we go 133.280642 Arwen has now booted
ignoring this startup-config 136.306329 enable see
no password was needed 141.898246 now that we are
safely in privileged exec mode I will
copy the start config to the running
config 147.854911 copy start run 150.863724 as you can see the
host name has changed to r1 as the
startup config is now the running config
158.142765 let's change the password to CCNA 162.156035 conf t
enable secret CCNA 167.482722 I'll also enable the
g00 interface 171.962680 interface g00 no shut 175.781035 now
it's important to restore the
configuration register to its default so
it doesn't always ignore the startup
config when booting up 184.003576 exit from ramen
we used the contract command 189.781555 but from
the regular CLI use config register 195.420617 and
the default setting is 0 X 2 1 0 2 199.266158 exit
now let's save the configuration 202.833949 right
step 2 is to backup our ones startup
configuration to our server TFTP 1 211.002928 first
I'll ping it to make sure it's reachable
215.489553 ping 192.168.1.100 222.129740 ok looks good
226.857803 To copy the configuration to a TFTP
server use this command 232.082177 copy startup
config TFTP 235.910656 now it asks us the IP
address 192.168.1.100 241.356447 and the file
name let's accept the default 244.103134 there we
go
246.885759 I'll go on TFTP one to check if it's
there 250.118196 click on the server and packet
tracer click services and then click
TFTP 256.799508 there it is r one config 259.202883 we have
successfully backed up our one startup
configuration
263.120799 the final step is to upgrade our ones
iOS image to a newer version which is on
our TFTP server 271.233049 first let's check the
iOS version on r one 275.284944 show version 278.678506 here
it says the version C 2900 software
version  15.14
286.974735 and down here is the image file 290.494839 now
let's find the new image on TFTP one
293.835464 here it is the C 2900 image 301.549297 and it's
version 15.53 indeed
a newer version 306.141567 I'll copy the name with
ctrl C 309.536108 now let's go back to r1 312.791442 I
want to copy the file from the TFTP
server to flash storage
so copy TFTP flash 322.117296 enter the IP address
192.168.1.100 326.889128 and then paste the
file name
329.274774 great we've copied the image from TFTP
to flash 338.655045 let's check 340.220503 show flash now
there are two iOS images in flash 345.650607 let's
delete the old one 347.146190 I'll copy the file
name here then delete it with this
command 354.522648 delete flash : and then paste
the file name 359.240356 okay show flash now we
only have one iOS image on flash 366.199210 let's
reload the router so it uses the new iOS
version 369.902523 reload
371.521168 okay r1 has booted up 386.162209 enabale okay 389.720104 now
let's check to the iOS version 391.829812 show
version there we go 396.937583 we're using the new
iOS version and here's the new image
file 401.354291 okay in this lab we performed
password recovery configuration backup
and an iOS upgrade 409.056416 that's all for this
