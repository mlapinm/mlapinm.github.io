studying for the CCNA 22.930770  in this lab we
will configure span  26.479353 which stands for
switched port analyzer 29.005749  span copies the
traffic from a particular interface  32.922978 and
sends it to another interface  35.652541 which
typically leads to a monitoring server
to monitor and analyze the traffic
passing through the monitored interface 42.038437 
packet tracer doesn't include an actual
monitoring server  47.046999 but will use a cool
feature of packet tracer the simulation
mode to verify that our configurations
are working 53.981645  let's get started  55.391478 okay the
first step is to simply ping from PC 2
to PC 1  60.814728 this is just to make sure PC 2
completes the ARP process  65.471916 you may have
noticed in these labs that the first
ping often fails  69.535666 that is because of the
art process not finishing before the
ping times out  73.669957 so let's do that ping 77.237416 
ping 1001 10 80.486061 
okay as you can see the first ping fails 89.438270 
but then after pc2 learns the MAC
address of its default gateway 93.379603  the
following pings succeed 95.567540  now let's switch
to simulation mode  98.823873 which is here in the
bottom right  100.604415 this useful feature lets us
trace the path of traffic and analyze it
at different points in its path 107.373498  okay now
let's ping again  110.145977 ping 1001 10 115.067790  here you
can see the ICMP packet at PC 2 120.907915  then I
click Next 122.725185  and it is sent to switch to 124.995977 
then R 2 R 1 switch 1  129.552018 and arrives at PC
1  131.409206 PC 1 then sends the reply back to
switch 1 R 1 R 2 switch 2 and then it
arrives at the destination PC 2  141.568393 if I
keep clicking here 143.780643  you can see other
traffic being sent including spanning
tree B PDUs from the switches EA GRP
hello packets 151.446247  between the routers and
the other pings sent from PC to 154.681205  does PC
1 156.001622  ok let's return to real-time mode  159.079747 so
we confirm that the pings traveled from
PC to in a straight path to PC 1  165.886017 no ICMP
packets were sent to server 1 168.703059  now let's
configure switch 1 to monitor the input
and output traffic on its G 0 1
interface  174.973038 and send it to a server 1 177.461371  I'll
hop on switch 1 now  179.370309 enable conf T 184.464163  span
is configured right here at global
configuration mode  188.630913 with the monitor
command  190.950017 then type session  193.223559 and give it a
number  195.044955 I'll sell you one  196.244038 next we specify
the source or destination 200.179808  the order
doesn't matter  201.420058 let's do this source 203.005912  now
there are multiple types of span  206.224662 but for
the CCNA you just have to do local span 209.571308 
which means from one interface on the
switch to another  213.090183 so the source will be
interface g0 one 217.355453 
then finally I will specify both to
monitor both incoming and outgoing
traffic on the interface  224.375078 you could
instead specify Rx for ingress or
incoming traffic  229.876244 or TX for egress or
outgoing traffic 233.121724  okay next let's specify
the destination interface 237.703515  which will be
g0 -  239.597536 because it's connected to server 1 241.825328 
monitor session one destination
interface g0 -  248.688015 okay that's all there is
to configuring local span 252.569474  it's really
quite simple 253.892015 
now let's switch to simulation mode once
more  257.979890 and ping from PC - to PC one  260.836369 and
will confirm that copies of the traffic
are being sent to server one 264.709369  ping 1001
1000 goes to switch 2 R 2 R 1 switch 1 278.921953 
and now as you can see it's sent to both
PC 1 and server one 284.375474  because switch 1
copied the ICMP packet that came in
honest g0 on interface  289.786953 and sent it to
server 1 as well 292.314932 
notice the red X on server 1 295.865515  that's
because server 1 discarded the packet  298.762786 in
a real situation where server 1 is an
actual monitoring server this would not
happen 304.724182 
ok next PC 1 sends the reply to switch 1 309.927057 
and then the reply is forwarded to r1 312.773640 
and once again it is also sent to server
one  315.507848 this time switch one copied the ICMP
packet being sent out of the g0 one
interface  320.941493 because we configured the both
statement 324.915263  when we configured span  326.439701 both
packets received on and transmitted from
the interface  330.746659 will be copied and sent to
server 1  333.139888 in this lab we configured span
to monitor traffic on a switch interface 339.050513 
the configuration is quite simple 341.425575  so
please try it out and learn it for your
exam 344.411221  that's all for this lab 346.283616
