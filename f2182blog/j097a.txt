00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,240
This is a free, complete course for the CCNA.

00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,740
Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:24,449
If you want more labs like this, I highly
recommend Boson Software’s NetSim for CCNA.

8
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,880
NetSim is a network simulator like Packet
Tracer, but it’s far more powerful and contains

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,809
over 100 detailed guided labs covering the
CCNA exam topics.

10
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,290
If you want to get NetSim, follow the link
in the description.

11
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:43,280
In this video we’ll configure DHCP snooping
on SW1 and SW2.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,510
This is the same topology as in the lecture
video, so you should be able to do this lab

13
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,560
on your own.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,070
Let’s get right into it by configuring R1
as a DHCP server for this local network.

15
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,580
ENABLE.

16
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:04,229
CONF T. Let’s exclude 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.9
from the pool.

17
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,570
Remember, this part of the configuration is
done outside of the DHCP pool.

18
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:17,360
IP DHCP EXCLUDED-ADDRESS 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.9.

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,960
Okay, now I’ll configure the pool.

20
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,980
IP DHCP POOL POOL1.

21
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:31,860
I’ll configure the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet.

22
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,680
NETWORK 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0.

23
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,320
And then configure R1 as the default gateway.

24
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,870
DEFAULT-ROUTER 192.168.1.1.

25
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:45,960
Okay, that’s all the configuration needed
on R1.

26
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,000
Next let’s configure DHCP snooping on SW1
and SW2.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,300
I’ll go on SW1 first.

28
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,300
ENABLE.

29
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,510
CONF T. First, enable DHCP snooping globally.

30
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,049
IP DHCP SNOOPING.

31
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:06,000
But, that isn’t enough to actually enable
DHCP snooping.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,860
We need to tell SW1 which VLANs to enable
it for.

33
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:16,100
Only VLAN 1 is being used in this network,
so IP DHCP SNOOPING VLAN 1.

34
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,959
Okay, now VLAN 1 is active.

35
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,480
However, all interfaces are untrusted, so
DHCP won’t be able to operate properly.

36
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,440
Let’s configure G0/2, connected to R1, as
a trusted port.

37
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,790
INTERFACE G0/2.

38
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,000
IP DHCP SNOOPING TRUST.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
EXIT.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,140
Okay, that’s all for SW1 for now.

41
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,590
There’s one command I left out, but we’ll
come back to it later.

42
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,620
Now I’ll do the exact same configurations
on SW2.

43
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,349
ENABLE.

44
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:52,599
CONF T. IP DHCP SNOOPING.

45
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:56,480
IP DHCP SNOOPING VLAN 1.

46
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,140
G0/1 is the uplink leading toward R1, so INTERFACE
G0/1.

47
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,480
IP DHCP SNOOPING TRUST.

48
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,050
Okay, now let’s try to get an IP address
on PC1.

49
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,430
To do that I’ll use the command IPCONFIG
/RENEW.

50
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,380
But, it’s going to fail.

51
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,480
Why is that?

52
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,190
The correct interfaces are configured as trusted,
and PC1 isn’t doing MAC address spoofing

53
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,700
or anything like that.

54
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,880
Well, let’s check by switching to simulation
mode.

55
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,070
And then do IPCONFIG /RENEW again.

56
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:40,020
The DHCP message goes to SW2 and then SW1,
and then it stops there.

57
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,020
Why?

58
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,709
Let’s check this message here, as it was
received by SW1.

59
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:53,000
Down at the bottom of the Inbound PDU details,
you can see the DHCP Agent Information Option.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,620
That’s the problem.

61
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,950
SW2 added this option to PC1’s message.

62
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,390
SW1 received it on an untrusted port, so it
discarded it.

63
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,530
Let’s go back to realtime mode now, and
fix that.

64
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:14,500
On SW1 first, I’ll configure NO IP DHCP
SNOOPING INFORMATION OPTION.

65
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,409
By the way, you can see the syslog messages
here for when SW1 dropped the DHCP message.

66
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:25,680
Notice it says option82 value on untrusted
port, so that’s why it was dropped.

67
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,580
And then I’ll configure the same on SW2
also.

68
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,559
NO IP DHCP SNOOPING INFORMATION OPTION.

69
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:38,139
I’ve explained why we need to use this command
in the lecture video so I won’t go over

70
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:39,300
it again.

71
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,669
Just remember that it’s necessary if the
switch isn’t acting as a DHCP relay agent.

72
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:49,270
Okay, let’s try that again on PC1.

73
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,509
IPCONFIG /RENEW.

74
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:58,500
Okay, this time it works and PC1 was able
to get an IP address.

75
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,699
So, in this lab we configured DHCP snooping.

76
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:04,220
It’s fairly simple to configure.

77
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,909
The only thing that can be tricky is remembering
to disable option 82.

78
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,569
As you can see, it can cause problems if you
don’t.

79
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:14,279
Okay, that’s all for this lab.

80
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:18,759
Now let’s take a look at a lab in Boson
Software’s NetSim for CCNA.
