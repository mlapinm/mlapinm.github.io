welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer
practice lab you can download the lab
file from the link in the description 8.474875 in
this lab we will look at DNS 12.773916 the domain
name System DNS is used to translate
names such as Cisco.com or google.com
to their appropriate IP addresses 22.897269 for us
humans these names are easier to
remember than IP addresses 27.329394 and I'm sure
very few of us actually know the IP
address of google.com for example 32.781602 so DNS
is very useful 35.473206 in this lab I have set up
a DNS server DNS one with the host names
of all the servers and networking
devices and their corresponding IP
addresses configured 45.524622 we will use DHCP
again to give pc1 & pc2 their IP
addresses as well as tell them to use
DNS 1 as a DNS server 55.310517 let's get started
the first step is to set up a DHCP pool
on r one like we did in the previous
lab 63.750225 enable conf t before I make the pool
I'll set up the excluded address range
which if you remember is configured
outside of DHCP configuration mode 76.952245 IP
dhcp excluded address 192.168.1.1
192.168.1.10 88.378015 ok now let's make the pool
91.191265 IP dhcp pool one pool network
192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 default router
192.168.1.1 106.306285 we won't specify a DNS
server just yet 109.533326 now let's go on pc one
just to make sure i'll do our release
and renew 116.262075 IP config slash release IP
config slash renew
121.865075 okay now pc one has an IP address and
default gateway 126.635970 however it has no dns
server yet 129.465054 let's try to ping server 1 by
IP address
133.267595 ping 10.0.0.101 the ping works 144.599470 it sends
the ping to its default gateway r1 which
then fords it to a server 1 149.537615 now let's
try to ping by name 152.312594 ping server 1 158.507094 ping
request could not find host server one
without a DNS server assigned PC one
can't translate the name server 1 to the
appropriate IP address 165.263988 let's fix that
166.682571 let's go back on r1 and add the DNS 1
server as a DNS server to the DHCP pool
174.948508 DNS server 20.0.0.100 181.673737 now I'll go back on
PC 1 and do another release and renew to
refresh the information and get the DNS
server 188.756007 IP config slash release IP config
slash renew 194.586152 ok now we've got the DNS
server information 198.599547 let's try to ping
server 1 and server 2 by name 201.544338 ping
server 1 204.648900 it can take some time to reach
the DNS server to resolve the name to
the IP address but in the end the ping
works
214.201962 okay now let's ping server 2 by name as
well
219.283462 ping server 2
again the ping works 231.594982 notice that
although we use the command ping server
2 immediately under it says pinging
10.0.0.102 as the DNS server result
the name to the proper IP address 243.540252 next
is to try the same from switch 1 248.915960 switch
1 has an IP address on its VLAN 1
interface 252.640897 so it can send and receive
pings 254.963855 however let's see if you can do so
without any further setup 258.606396 enable ping
10.0.0.101 the ping fails
271.754125 since the ping by IP address fails
there's no need to try to ping by name
276.659979 if PC one camp in server 1 279.814249 Y can't
switch 1 281.272186 well r1 has distributed default
gateway and DNS information to PC 1 via
DHCP 289.766061 however it's not giving that
information to switch 1 292.456165 so let's
manually configure r1 as switch ones
default gateway and DNS 1 as switch ones
DNS server 301.041248 conf t to specify a default
gateway use this command 306.739706 IP default
gateway 192.168.1.1 312.818393 ok now to specify a
DNS server use this command 316.788330 IP name
server 20.0.0.100 exit 323.537809 ok let's try those
pings again 325.892475 ping 1000 101
330.184829 ping works this time 336.472724 and now let's try
to ping by name and see if our dns
configuration works 341.103349 ping server one
it works again and actually you can see
the message here translating server 1
domain server 20.0.0.100 and then down
here the IP address of server 1 10.0.0.101
364.241869 ok in this lab we took a bit of a look
at DNS the domain name system 369.901452 that's all
