6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,300
Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,140
Also, remember to sign up via the link in
the description to get all of the lab files

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,020
for this course, so you can try it out yourself
in packet tracer.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,300
If you want more labs like these, I highly
recommend picking up Boson’s NetSim for

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,179
the CCNA, click the link in the video description
to check it out.

11
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:39,210
It’s a network simulator like packet tracer,
but it’s even better, and it includes all

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,210
of these guided labs to not only help you
get hands-on practice configuring and troubleshooting,

13
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,569
but also deepen your understanding of the
exam topics.

14
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:52,549
I used it myself when studying for my certifications,
so I feel confident about recommending it

15
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:54,030
to all of you.

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,999
If you want to get your own copy of NetSim,
please follow the link in the video description.

17
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:04,379
In this video we’ll practice some basic
EIGRP configurations.

18
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,260
The configuration of EIGRP itself isn’t
part of the exam, but I want to use this video

19
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:16,299
to introduce some aspects of EIGRP that might
come up on the exam, specifically EIGRP metric,

20
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:20,560
path selection, and unequal-cost load-balancing.

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,969
My advice is to try to remember the extra
topics I introduce in this video, but don’t

22
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:28,570
worry about remembering all of the EIGRP-specific
commands.

23
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,789
Actually, this video will be half lab and
half lecture, since I want to introduce those

24
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,900
other topics.

25
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,300
This network here is EIGRP AS100.

26
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,260
So, we’ll have to make sure we configure
each of these routers in AS 100 or they won’t

27
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,069
become EIGRP neighbors, and therefore won’t
exchange route information.

28
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:54,189
In this network, the link between R1 and R2
is a GigabitEthernet connection, but the other

29
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:57,530
connections between routers are FastEthernet.

30
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,350
Step 1 is to configure the appropriate hostnames
and IP addresses on each device, and also

31
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,450
enable the router interfaces.

32
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:11,299
Instead of pre-configuring everything, I decided
to give you some extra practice with the basics.

33
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:15,900
To save time in this video I did pre-configure
everything before recording, but in the file

34
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,670
you download you’ll have to configure the
IP addresses and such yourself.

35
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,510
So, let’s move straight to step 2.

36
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,310
Configure a loopback interface on each router.

37
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,390
I only briefly mentioned these in the last
video when talking about router IDs, and I’ll

38
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:36,290
talk more about them in the OSPF videos coming
up next, but I wanted to give a little preview

39
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,290
here.

40
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,500
I’ll hop on R1 and configure its loopback
interface.

41
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,870
ENABLE.

42
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,689
First let’s check R1’s interfaces.

43
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:50,060
SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.

44
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:55,769
So, you can see the interfaces which I pre-configured
here, but no loopback interface yet.

45
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:58,030
So, let’s make one.

46
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,989
Enter global config mode.

47
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:05,829
CONF T. INTERFACE, and let’s use the question
mark.

48
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:11,440
Here you can see the loopback option, so type
in LOOPBACK, or as a shortcut just the letter

49
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,810
‘L’ works too.

50
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,530
Then let’s use the question mark again.

51
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,849
As you can see the numerical range you can
use for the loopback interface is quite large,

52
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:25,069
I’m not sure what the maximum number of
loopback interfaces you can create on a router

53
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:28,329
is, but it probably depends on the type of
router.

54
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:32,569
Anyway, I’ll just make this ‘loopback
0’.

55
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:37,480
As soon as you enter the command, you get
a notice saying the interface has come up.

56
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,629
Now you can configure the IP address just
like on a physical interface.

57
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:48,640
IP ADDRESS 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.255.

58
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,640
It’s common to use a /32 mask for loopback
addresses.

59
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,700
I won’t talk in depth about loopback interfaces
in this video, just know that a loopback interface

60
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,640
is a virtual interface in the router.

61
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,640
Now let’s check the interfaces here once
more.

62
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,799
DO SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.

63
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,099
Now you can see the Loopback0 interface and
the IP address we configured.

64
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:14,129
Notice it’s up/up.

65
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:19,840
A loopback interface is always up unless you
manually disable it with the SHUTDOWN command.

66
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,050
Now I’ll go through the other routers and
configure their loopback interfaces.

67
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,960
Next up, R2.

68
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,560
ENABLE.

69
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,800
CONF T. INTERFACE L0.

70
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,850
As you can see, you can just type ‘L’
followed by the interface number to configure

71
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,840
a loopback interface.

72
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:47,540
IP ADDRESS 2.2.2.2 255.255.255.255.

73
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,900
Next let’s configure R3.

74
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,560
ENABLE.

75
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,840
CONF T. INTERFACE L0.

76
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:04,730
IP ADDRESS 3.3.3.3 255.255.255.255.

77
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,700
And finally, R4.

78
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,220
ENABLE.

79
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,140
CONF T. INTERFACE L0.

80
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:19,640
IP ADDRESS 4.4.4.4 255.255.255.255.

81
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,760
Okay, that’s all for step 2.

82
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,510
Next up let’s configure EIGRP on each router.

83
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,930
Since I’m on R4 already, I’ll start here.

84
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,930
You can enter EIGRP configuration mode directly
from interface configuration mode, there’s

85
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,950
no need to go back to global config mode.

86
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:45,840
ROUTER EIGRP, and for EIGRP we have to enter
the AS, autonomous system number.

87
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,020
This number must match for two routers to
become EIGRP neighbors.

88
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,660
In this lab, I’m using an AS number of 100.

89
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,820
From here, let’s enable EIGRP on all interfaces.

90
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,370
Actually, let me show you a little shortcut.

91
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,970
This is not recommended in real networks,
because you should be more precise about which

92
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,120
interfaces you want to enable EIGRP on.

93
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,990
But you can enable EIGRP on ALL interfaces
at once with this command.

94
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,740
NETWORK 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255.

95
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:26,100
Remember, the NETWORK command uses a wildcard
mask, so this is like a subnet mask of 0.0.0.0,

96
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,500
meaning a /0 prefix length.

97
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:37,680
So, ALL IP address are in the 0.0.0.0/0 range,
therefore EIGRP is activated on all interfaces.

98
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,430
Once again, not recommended in real networks,
but a simple trick for labs.

99
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,650
Next we are instructed to disable auto-summary.

100
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,470
The routers I used in the lecture video had
auto-summary disabled by default, however

101
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:57,050
these routers have it enabled by default,
so we should disable it.

102
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,340
Let me show you it’s activated.

103
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,190
DO SHOW IP PROTOCOLS.

104
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:07,100
It says right here, ‘Automatic network summarization
is in effect.’

105
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,930
So, let’s turn that off.

106
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,910
NO AUTO-SUMMARY.

107
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,540
And let’s check once more.

108
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,650
DO SHOW IP PROTOCOLS.

109
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,680
‘Automatic network summarization is not
in effect.’

110
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,470
That’s better.

111
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,890
Next up we are told to configure passive interfaces
where appropriate, including loopback interfaces.

112
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:31,040
So, I said in the lecture video that we should
make interfaces like G0/0, not connected to

113
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,060
any EIGRP neighbors, a passive interface.

114
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,340
However, it’s a good idea to do it on loopback
interfaces also.

115
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,340
Why?

116
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,230
Well, the router will treat the loopback interface
like any other interface and try to send EIGRP

117
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:48,860
messages out of it, even though the loopback
interface isn’t connected to any device.

118
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:54,380
It’s just a waste of resources on the router,
so we should make it a passive interface.

119
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,900
Let’s do that.

120
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,880
PASSIVE-INTERFACE G0/0.

121
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,040
PASSIVE-INTERFACE L0.

122
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,150
And let’s check.

123
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,390
DO SHOW IP PROTOCOLS.

124
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,860
Now GigabitEthernet0/0 and Loopback0 are listed
as passive interfaces.

125
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:15,990
Okay, that’s all of the configuration on
R4, next I’ll do R3.

126
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,610
Directly from interface config mode, let’s
go into EIGRP config mode.

127
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,560
ROUTER EIGRP 100.

128
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,210
Again, make sure that AS number matches with
the other routers.

129
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,740
Here on R3 I’ll be a little more responsible
and use the exact prefix on each interface

130
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,400
to enable EIGRP.

131
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:43,569
NETWORK 10.0.13.0 0.0.0.3, that’s a /30
prefix length written as a wildcard mask.

132
00:08:43,569 --> 00:08:47,089
NETWORK 10.0.34.0 0.0.0.3.

133
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:52,530
Don’t forget the loopback interface, we
want to advertise R3’s loopback address

134
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,860
to the other routers.

135
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,320
NETWORK 3.3.3.3 0.0.0.0.

136
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,280
That’s a /32 prefix length written as a
wildcard mask.

137
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,680
Next disable auto-summary.

138
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,940
NO AUTO-SUMMARY.

139
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,560
Finally, make Loopback0 a passive interface.

140
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:13,980
PASSIVE-INTERFACE L0.

141
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,480
Let’s check the configurations.

142
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,110
DO SHOW IP PROTOCOLS.

143
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,540
Auto-summary is disabled, these are the network
commands I configured, and Loopback0 is a

144
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,540
passive interface.

145
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,740
Looks good!

146
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,810
Next up I’ll do basically the same configurations
on R2.

147
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,100
ROUTER EIGRP 100.

148
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:47,870
NETWORK 10.0.12.0 0.0.0.3 NETWORK 10.0.24.0
0.0.0.3.

149
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,769
NETWORK 2.2.2.2 0.0.0.0.

150
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:55,000
NO AUTO-SUMMARY.

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,760
PASSIVE-INTERFACE L0.

152
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,340
That’s it.

153
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,120
I’ll quickly check that everything is okay.

154
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:06,120
DO SHOW IP PROTOCOLS.

155
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:13,459
Auto-summary is disabled, the network commands
are correct, and Loopback0 is a passive interface.

156
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:17,879
Finally I’ll go on R1 and do the same configurations,
but we’ll spend some more time here and

157
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:21,550
get a little more in depth about how EIGRP
works.

158
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,620
ROUTER EIGRP 100.

159
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:30,160
NETWORK 10.0.12.0 0.0.0.3.

160
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,100
NETWORK 10.0.13.0 0.0.0.3.

161
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:41,240
Notice how quickly EIGRP forms adjacencies
with its neighbors, it’s basically instant.

162
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,860
NETWORK 1.1.1.1 0.0.0.0.

163
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,189
NO AUTO-SUMMARY.

164
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,249
PASSIVE-INTERFACE L0.

165
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:57,020
Okay, first up I’ll check DO SHOW IP PROTOCOLS
like the others.

166
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,850
Auto-summary is disabled, I’ve configured
the correct network prefixes, loopback0 is

167
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:07,690
a passive interface, and you can also see
R1’s EIGRP neighbors down here, meaning

168
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:11,079
EIGRP was successfully enabled on its interfaces.

169
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:15,899
Let’s check a better command to view the
EIGRP neighbors.

170
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,899
DO SHOW IP EIGRP NEIGHBORS.

171
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:25,560
OSPF has basically the same command to view
neighbors, so remember this one.

172
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,070
You can see R1’s two neighbors, which interface
they are connected to, and some other information

173
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,269
that you don’t need to worry about now.

174
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:38,779
Let’s also check if R1 is receiving the
correct EIGRP routes.

175
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:44,170
DO SHOW IP ROUTE, and you can actually filter
the command to view only EIGRP routes in the

176
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,790
routing table by adding EIGRP on the end like
this.

177
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:54,290
You can also do commands like this, DO SHOW
IP ROUTE CONNECTED, which shows connected

178
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,550
routes.

179
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:01,329
If we configured static routes you could see
them with ‘SHOW IP ROUTE STATIC’, etc.

180
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:04,689
But this time, let’s view the EIGRP routes.

181
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:08,029
DO SHOW IP ROUTE EIGRP.

182
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:11,110
Notice the ‘D’ that indicates EIGRP routes.

183
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:17,600
So, R1 has routes to the loopback interfaces
of R2, R3, and R4.

184
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:25,519
Also routes to the 10.0.24.0 subnet between
R2 and R4, the 10.0.34.0 subnet between R3

185
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:32,339
and R4, and 192.168.4.0/24, R4’s internal
network.

186
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:33,480
Perfect!

187
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:41,889
Notice EIGRP’s metric numbers, for example
156,416 to R4’s loopback interface.

188
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:46,839
Fortunately, when we move to OSPF you’ll
see the numbers are much smaller and easier

189
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:48,149
to calculate.

190
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:53,740
Okay, now one last command, this one is important
to understand step 4.

191
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,550
DO SHOW IP EIGRP TOPOLOGY.

192
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:02,500
Here you can see more detailed information
about the EIGRP routes R1 has received, not

193
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,089
just the ones in the routing table.

194
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:11,779
For example, here are two routes to 192.168.4.0/24,
although only one is entered in the routing

195
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:12,779
table.

196
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:18,520
That’s the route via R2, since it has a
lower metric value because of the GigabitEthernet

197
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
link.

198
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:26,059
Okay, it’s time to go into lecture mode
to explain some things about EIGRP.

199
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:30,189
First off let me explain a little bit more
about EIGRP metric, even though I’ve mentioned

200
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:32,560
it briefly a few times.

201
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,010
By default, EIGRP uses bandwidth and delay
to calculate the metric of a route.

202
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,930
This is the formula used to calculate metric.

203
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,959
It looks quite complicated, but there’s
no need to memorize it.

204
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,569
Notice the ‘K’ values, K1, K2, K3, K4,
and K5 in the formula.

205
00:13:50,569 --> 00:14:01,089
The default K values are K1 = 1, K2 = 0, K3
= 1, K4 = 0, and K5 = 0.

206
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:07,119
K1 is multiplied by bandwidth and K3 is multiplied
by delay.

207
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:11,649
Since you don’t have to worry about memorizing
this formula or actually calculating EIGRP

208
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:16,220
metric yourself, you can just think of EIGRP
metric like this.

209
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,209
Metric equals bandwidth plus delay.

210
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:22,470
But there’s something else you should know,
let me demonstrate here.

211
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:27,600
It’s not simply bandwidth plus delay, but
rather bandwidth of the slowest link in the

212
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,000
path to the destination, plus the delay of
all links in the path to the destination.

213
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,279
For example, let’s say R1 wants to send
traffic to R4’s LAN, 192.168.4.0/24.

214
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,220
The route via R2 is the best.

215
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:48,579
So, the bandwidth of the slowest link, that’s
this one here, is added to the delay of all

216
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:54,029
links, these three, and then you get the total
metric value of the route.

217
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:57,870
By the way, the routers don’t actually send
ping messages to measure the delay of each

218
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:03,370
link, the ‘delay’ value is actually a
default value based on the interface bandwidth.

219
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:08,060
So, what should you remember about EIGRP metric
for the test?

220
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,899
Remember that it’s calculated by adding
the bandwidth of the slowest link to the delay

221
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:12,899
of all links.

222
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:16,410
Let’s move on.

223
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,730
Now let’s cover some important EIGRP terminology.

224
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:26,189
Feasible distance means THIS ROUTER’s metric
value to the route’s destination.

225
00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:33,980
From R1’s perspective, trying to reach 192.168.4.0/24
, that means the metric of the whole route,

226
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:40,560
from R1 to R2, then R2 to R4, then for R4
to send the traffic out of its own inteface.

227
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,550
But, there is another term you should know.

228
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,559
Reported distance, which is also known as
advertised distance.

229
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:50,509
This is the neighbor’s metric value to reach
the destination.

230
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:56,380
So, for this route the neighbor is R2, the
reported distance is R2’s metric to the

231
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,360
destination.

232
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,810
Note that these terms are NOT related to the
concept of administrative distance.

233
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:09,430
EIGRP uses the term ‘distance’, but this
is the metric used to compare EIGRP routes,

234
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:13,899
not the administrative distance which is used
to compare routes from different routing protocols.

235
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:18,059
Let’s take a look at the real costs in Packet
Tracer.

236
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:26,069
Here’s the output of the SHOW IP EIGRP TOPOLOGY
command, just for the route to the 192.168.4.0/24

237
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,019
network.

238
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,050
The number on the left is R1’s metric, the
Feasible Distance.

239
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:36,369
The number on the right is R1’s neighbor,
R2’s metric, the Reported Distance.

240
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:40,199
How about the route below it via R3?

241
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:45,199
This is the feasible distance, R1’s total
metric to reach the destination.

242
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:51,199
This is the reported distance, R1’s neighbor
R3’s metric to reach the destination.

243
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,899
Why is it important to know both of these
terms?

244
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:58,679
You need to know them to understand the next
two terms I’m going to introduce.

245
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:01,230
Here are the next two terms.

246
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,620
Successor is the term for the route with the
lowest metric to the destination, so it’s

247
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,440
the best route.

248
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,640
In this case, which route to 192.168.4.0/24
is the successor?

249
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,690
It’s the route via R2, because it has the
lower metric, it’s the best route.

250
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:19,709
Next term.

251
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:25,680
A Feasible Successor is an alternate route
to the destination, it’s not the best route,

252
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,200
but it must meet the ‘feasibility condition’.

253
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,710
Okay, pay attention here.

254
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,960
What is the feasibility condition that must
be met?

255
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,710
A route is considered a feasible successor
if it’s reported distance is lower than

256
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,730
the successor route’s feasible distance.

257
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:48,050
So, does the route via R3 meet this feasibility
condition?

258
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:53,150
It’s reported distance is 28,416.

259
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:59,030
The successor route via R2’s feasible distance
is 28,672.

260
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:09,110
28,416 is less than 28,672, so the route via
R3 is a feasible successor.

261
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,400
Why does EIGRP have this system of feasible
successors?

262
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,510
It’s a kind of loop-prevention.

263
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:21,100
If a route meets the feasibility requirement,
it is guaranteed not to be a looped route.

264
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,980
I’m not going to spend time explaining that
in depth, but remember that this is a loop-prevention

265
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,560
mechanism.

266
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:33,670
With that knowledge, let me now explain how
EIGRP does unequal-cost load-balancing, a

267
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:39,010
unique feature of EIGRP, because other routing
protocols only perform load-balancing if each

268
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,550
route’s metric is equal.

269
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:45,500
So, here is some output from the SHOW IP PROTOCOLS
command.

270
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,000
Down here it says EIGRP maximum metric variance
1.

271
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,710
This is the default value, 1.

272
00:18:52,710 --> 00:19:00,060
With a variance of 1, only equal cost multipath,
ECMP, load-balancing will be performed.

273
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,550
This means a route’s feasible distance must
be equal to the successor route to be chosen

274
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,970
for load-balancing.

275
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:11,170
Actually, if another route’s FD is equal
to the successor route’s FD, that route

276
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,440
is a successor too, there can be multiple
successors.

277
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:20,860
So, with the default settings EIGRP doesn’t
do unequal-cost load-balancing.

278
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:26,680
For example, these are R1’s routes to 192.168.4.0/24.

279
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,400
This is the successor route’s FD, and this
is the feasible successor’s.

280
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,240
It’s higher, so it can’t be used to load-balance.

281
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:41,480
So, from EIGRP configuration mode I used the
VARIANCE command, and set it to 2.

282
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,480
What does that mean?

283
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,870
Well, it’s basically a multiplier.

284
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:51,380
VARIANCE 2 means that feasible successor routes
with an FD up to two times the successor route’s

285
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,600
FD can be used to load-balance.

286
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,330
Let me explain with our example.

287
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,410
Here are our routes.

288
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:05,030
The successor’s FD is 28,672, but I just
configured a variance of 2, so we can double

289
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,710
that.

290
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:11,550
28,672 times 2 equals 57,344.

291
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:16,890
The feasible successor’s FD is 30,976.

292
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:26,310
30,976 is less than 57,344, so the route via
R3 can now be used for load-balancing.

293
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:30,800
I’ll show you in the next slide that it
has now been entered in the routing table

294
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,410
of R1.

295
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,160
But let me emphasize one thing.

296
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:40,870
EIGRP will only perform unequal-cost load-balancing
over feasible successor routes.

297
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:46,020
If a route does’t meet the feasibility requirement,
it will NEVER be selected for load-balancing,

298
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,390
regardless of the variance.

299
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:53,210
This is because the feasibility requirement
is an important loop-prevention mechanism,

300
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:58,800
so the router will never ignore it and put
a non-feasible route in the routing table.

301
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:05,710
Here is that route to 192.168.4.0/24 as shown
in R1’s route table.

302
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:10,560
Notice that, even though the two routes have
different metric values, R1 now inserts both

303
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,920
into the routing table.

304
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:18,120
However, R1 will send slightly more traffic
via R2 than R3, because R2’s path has a

305
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,120
lower metric, it’s a faster path.

306
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,790
Before finishing up let me review those four
terms.

307
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:30,800
A route’s feasible distance is THIS router’s
metric value to the route’s destination.

308
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:36,660
A route’s reported distance is the neighbor
router’s metric value to the destination.

309
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,710
Remember that this is also called ‘Advertised
Distance’.

310
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:44,490
A successor route is the route with the
lowest metric to the destination, the best

311
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:45,490
route.

312
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:50,760
However, there can be multiple successors
if they have the same metric, EIGRP will do

313
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,900
ECMP load-balancing.

314
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,720
A feasible successor route is an alternate
route to the destination which meets the feasibility

315
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,570
condition.

316
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,980
And finally, that feasibility condition is
this: A route is considered a feasible successor

317
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,740
if it’s reported distance is lower than
the successor route’s feasible distance.

318
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:15,610
Now, at this point I usually show you an extra
lab in Boson NetSim, however since we just

319
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:20,550
did this mini-lecture and I found a really
relevant question in ExSim, let’s do another

320
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,580
question in ExSim instead.

321
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:29,690
Okay, for today's Boson ExSim practice question,
we have a question that's really relevant

322
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,700
to what we just studied.

323
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,590
So, click on 'launch simulator' and here it
is.

324
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:39,100
Select the following EIGRP terms from the
left and drag them to the right, placing them

325
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,940
over the corresponding definitions.

326
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,170
So these are the four terms we just looked
at.

327
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:47,760
Advertised distance, which is reported distance.

328
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,130
Feasible distance.

329
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,130
Feasible successor.

330
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,600
And successor.

331
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,700
And then the four definitions.

332
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,710
So, they give slightly different definitions
than what I gave you, so you'll have to think

333
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,710
about this a little bit.

334
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,940
The best metric along a path.

335
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,070
The best path to a destination network.

336
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,830
A backup path that is guaranteed to be loop
free.

337
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:11,110
And the metric that the next hop router, the
neighbor router, has calculated.

338
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:19,620
So pause the video here to match those terms
with the definitions.

339
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,540
Okay, hopefully you got the answer.

340
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:27,290
So, two of these terms, the ones with 'distance'
in the name, refer to a kind of metric, a

341
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,460
metric value.

342
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:33,900
And these two, successor and feasible successor,
refer to a kind of route in EIGRP.

343
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:40,230
So for example, successor is the best route
to any, or to a given destination.

344
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:44,510
Or as Boson puts it, the best path to a destination
network.

345
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,420
That is the successor route.

346
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,780
And feasible successor is the other kind of
path, a backup path that is guaranteed to

347
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:56,100
be loop free, that is an EIGRP feasible successor.

348
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,090
Okay, now we have the two kinds of metric.

349
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:03,340
One of them is the best metric along a path,
and the other is the metric that the next

350
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,290
hop router has calculated.

351
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:10,230
So, the metric that the next hop router has
calculated is the advertised distance.

352
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:15,540
It is the distance, the metric, that the neighbor
router advertises to the local router, this

353
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,690
router.

354
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,650
And finally the feasible distance is the best
metric along a path.

355
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:26,050
So, click on 'done', then 'show answer'.

356
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,230
And I was correct.

357
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,040
So this is Boson's explanation here.

358
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,880
And also it has a reference to some Cisco
documentation, Introduction to EIGRP.

359
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,350
This Cisco documentation is also a great resource
by the way.

360
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:44,210

362
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,350
Actually, I'm studying for my CCNA now.

363
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:53,480
I already have my CCNA but I want to take
the new exam to help improve my course.

364
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,740
So I'm using Boson ExSim to help guide my
studies and it's really helpful.
