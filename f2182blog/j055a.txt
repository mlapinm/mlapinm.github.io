6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,279
Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,359
Also, remember to sign up via the link in
the description to get all of the lab files

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,180
for this course, so you can try it out yourself
in packet tracer.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,359
If you want more labs like these, I highly
recommend picking up Boson’s NetSim for

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,420
the CCNA, click the link in the video description
to check it out.

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,180
It’s a network simulator like packet tracer,
but it’s even better, and it includes all

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,120
of these guided labs to not only help you
get hands-on practice configuring and troubleshooting,

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,940
but also deepen your understanding of the
exam topics.

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,720
I used it myself when studying for my certifications,
so I feel confident about recommending it

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,300
to all of you.

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,270
If you want to get your own copy of NetSim,
please follow the link in the video description.

17
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,690
In this lab we will go through the configurations
covered in the lecture video.

18
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,519
Let’s get right into it.

19
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,110
First, in step 1 we will ping an external
server, 8.8.8.8 from these two PCs, as well

20
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,880
as check their default gateway.

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,650
I’ll do the ping from PC1 first.

22
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:26,180
PING 8.8.8.8.

23
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,460
Okay, the ping works.

24
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,520
Now let’s check PC1’s default gateway.

25
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,370
On a PC you can use this command, IPCONFIG,
to check the IP settings.

26
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:44,210
So, R1’s (*PC1's) default gateway address is 10.0.1.253,
which is R1.

27
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,600
Now let’s check on PC2.

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,450
First I’ll ping the server.

29
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:57,860
PING 8.8.8.8.

30
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,800
Okay, we’re getting replies.

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,600
So, what’s PC2’s default gateway?

32
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:04,979
Let’s check.

33
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:05,979
IPCONFIG.

34
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:09,950
It’s R1, so it’s the same as PC1.

35
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,940
Now, let me do something I didn’t do on
PC1.

36
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,200
I’ll do a traceroute to 8.8.8.8.

37
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,689
I’ve shown you this once before I think,
it’s a very useful command.

38
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:28,569
On PCs the command is ‘tracert’, but be
aware that in Cisco IOS it’s ‘traceroute’,

39
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:30,719
spelled out fully.

40
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:40,930
So, TRACERT 8.8.8.8, and you can confirm that
the first hop is 10.0.1.253, before it reaches

41
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:48,620
8.8.8.8, which is just a loopback interface
on R3, by the way.

42
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:56,090
Next up in step 2 we are told to configure
HSRP version 2 on R1 and R2.

43
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:02,059
We should make sure R1 is the active router,
raise its priority, lower R2’s priority,

44
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:03,950
and also enable preemption.

45
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,609
Let’s go on R1.

46
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:10,049
ENABLE.

47
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:19,049
CONF T. Remember, FHRPs like HSRP are configured
directly on the interface, G0/0 in this case.

48
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:20,419
INTERFACE G0/0.

49
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:25,209
First, let’s enable HSRP version 2.

50
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:30,560
The command is STANDBY VERSION 2.

51
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,489
Next I’ll configure the virtual IP.

52
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:38,530
I didn’t mention this in the lecture video,
but notice that you can configure the IP,

53
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,639
preemption, priority, etc without specifying
the group number.

54
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,760
If you do this, the router will automatically
use a group number of 0.

55
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,849
The STANDBY VERSION command, however, applies
to all groups, you don’t need to specify

56
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:53,950
the group number.

57
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,279
I like to match the group number with the
VLAN number, so I’m going to configure a

58
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,629
group number of 1.

59
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:05,969
I haven’t done any VLAN configuration on
the switches, so everything is in VLAN 1.

60
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:09,339
You can use whatever group number you want,
though.

61
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:14,079
First I’ll configure the virtual IP and
get HSRP actually running.

62
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:17,860
STANDBY 1 IP 10.0.1.254.

63
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,660
Next, the priority.

64
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,670
STANDBY 1 PRIORITY 200.

65
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,130
The default is 100.

66
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,570
Finally I’ll enable preemption.

67
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,120
STANDBY 1 PREEMPT.

68
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,770
Okay, that’s all for now on R1.

69
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,640
Now I’ll configure R2.

70
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,789
ENABLE.

71
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:42,470
CONF T. INTERFACE G0/0.

72
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:48,580
Okay, I’m going to leave it at HSRP version
1 for now, to show you what happens when there

73
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,240
is a version mismatch.

74
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,370
Let’s configure the priority.

75
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,330
STANDBY 1 PRIORITY 50.

76
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,120
Now the virtual IP, same as on R1.

77
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,460
STANDBY 1 IP 10.0.1.254.

78
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,240
Now I’m going to click this arrow here in
packet tracer to fast forward 30 seconds.

79
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,569
If I return to R2, you can see all of these
messages about a duplicate address.

80
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:21,910
That’s because both R1 and R2 think they
are the active router.

81
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,090
Why is that?

82
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,229
It’s because of the version mismatch.

83
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:31,230
Because there is a version mismatch, they
aren’t able to negotiate an active and standby,

84
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,099
they both claim to be the active router.

85
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:38,450
To fix this, I’ll configure version 2 here
on R2.

86
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,450
STANDBY VERSION 2.

87
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,100
Now I’ll click those arrows again.

88
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,470
And now I’ll check back on R2.

89
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,020
So, the messages have stopped.

90
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,530
Let’s check DO SHOW STANDBY.

91
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,930
Okay, state is standby.

92
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,490
And down here you can see that the active
router is 10.0.1.253, which is R1.

93
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:07,819
So, now that the versions match everything
seems to be working fine.

94
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:14,469
Next up, in step 3 I’ll configure the new
VIP as the default gateway of PC1 and PC2.

95
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:17,590
PC1 first.

96
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:22,939
Click on ‘config’, then set the default
gateway here.

97
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:25,810
Now I’ll do the same on PC2.

98
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:32,379
‘Config’, and set it to 10.0.1.254.

99
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:35,789
From here on PC2 I’ll try a ping again.

100
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:40,740
PING 8.8.8.8.

101
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,280
Okay, the ping works.

102
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,900
And let’s check the ARP table.

103
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:53,509
On PCs the command is ARP -A. There it is,
10.0.1.254.

104
00:06:53,509 --> 00:07:02,500
Notice the HSRP version 2 virtual MAC address,
0000 0C9F F001.

105
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,770
Now let me show you another interesting point.

106
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,480
Let’s try a traceroute again.

107
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:13,080
TRACERT 8.8.8.8.

108
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:20,600
Notice that the first hop address is 10.0.1.253,
the IP address of R1’s G0/0 interface, not

109
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,490
the virtual IP address.

110
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,499
Even though the virtual IP is configured as
the default gateway, R1 replies to the traceroute

111
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:32,430
using the interface IP address instead of
the virtual IP address.

112
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:38,099
So, traceroute is a useful tool to check that
the correct gateway is being used in a situation

113
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:42,080
like this.

114
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,789
Next up, let’s turn off R1.

115
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:49,220
But before that, we must make sure to save
the config!

116
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:55,860
Here on R1 I’ll type END to return to privileged
exec mode, and then WRITE to save the running

117
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,080
config.

118
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,719
If you forget to save the config, it will
be lost when R1 restarts.

119
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:03,949
Now let’s turn off R1.

120
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:12,029
To do so, click on the ‘physical’ tab
here, and you can flip the power switch here.

121
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:17,160
Now I’ll click the arrows to fast forward
30 seconds so R2 can become the active router,

122
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,659
and now let’s try a ping from PC1.

123
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,740
PING 8.8.8.8.

124
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,159
Okay, the 
ping works, so we know R2 must be acting as

125
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:38,950
the default gateway, R1 is turned off, but
let’s try a traceroute anyway to be sure.

126
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,710
TRACERT 8.8.8.8.

127
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:50,760
Okay, this time the first hop is displayed
as 10.0.1.252, R2’s IP address, even though

128
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,720
the virtual IP used as the default gateway
is .254.

129
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,530
Finally, let’s turn on R1 again.

130
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:04,060
Go back to R1, and flip the power switch.

131
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,580
I’ll press the arrows again to skip forward.

132
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:13,850
Now, without checking the CLI of R1 or R2
to see the state, I’ll try a ping and traceroute

133
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,850
from PC1.

134
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,520
We enabled preemption, so R1 should take back
the active router role.

135
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,090
Let’s try the ping first.

136
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:30,480
PING 8.8.8.8.

137
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,370
Okay, it works.

138
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:38,370
Now traceroute, let’s see if R1’s or R2’s
IP address is displayed as the first hop.

139
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:44,660
TRACERT 8.8.8.8.

140
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:53,780
It is R1’s IP address of 10.0.1.253, so
R1 has become the active router once again.

141
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,120
Okay, that’s all for this lab.

142
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,670
Next let’s take a look at a bonus lab in
Boson NetSim for CCNA.

143
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,730
Okay, here's today's Boson NetSim lab preview.

144
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:10,390
As I said in the video, FHRP configuration
isn't part of the CCNA exam anymore.

145
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,980
So, it's actually not in NetSim for CCNA.

146
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:21,260
But I still want to show you an HSRP lab,
so I have selected a lab from the ENCOR, CCNP

147
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,340
ENCOR 350-401 NetSim.

148
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,310
So, NetSim for CCNP ENCOR.

149
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:33,520
And FHRP configuration is an exam topic on
the CCNP, and as you can see there are plenty

150
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,500
of labs for FHRPs in NetSim for CCNP.

151
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:44,660
Starting here, 'Configuring Hot Standby Router
Protocol', all the way down to here, 'Troubleshooting

152
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,840
GLBP'.

153
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:52,080
So I counted, in total there are 19 labs covering
HSRP, VRRP, and GLBP.

154
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,900
So, all the configuration practice you need
for FHRPs.

155
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:03,140
Okay, the lab I've selected for today is this
one, configuring hot standby router protocol.

156
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,300
So let's check it out.

157
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,320
This is the lab topology.

158
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,350
Pretty simple, we got four switches, access
switches, distribution switches.

159
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,630
And then two routers.

160
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:19,430
And we're going to configure HSRP on these
routers.

161
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,140
These are the commands you need to know.

162
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,540
The STANDBY commands we covered in the lecture,
and the ones we just saw.

163
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,450
The IP addresses on each device.

164
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,990
And the lab tasks, there are four main tasks
in this lab.

165
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,830
Task 1, verify basic connectivity.

166
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,560
Task 2, configure HSRP.

167
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,050
Task 3, verify HSRP configuration.

168
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:46,740
And task 4, assign HSRP priorities and preempt.

169
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:52,040
So, for this lab preview let's just do task
1 and task 2.

170
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,590
So first up, task 1.

171
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:58,180
It says this task involves verifying the connectivity
of the devices on the network.

172
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,380
Okay, so here's step 1.

173
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:07,320
Verify all non-HSRP IP addresses on each device
by using the proper SHOW command and the IP

174
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,740
addresses table.

175
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,030
Alright, so let's check.

176
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:15,390
So, the CLI of Router1 is already open.

177
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,840
So I will check it out.

178
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,900
SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.

179
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,490
FastEthernet0/0, looks good.

180
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,150
And 0/1 looks good also.

181
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:34,590
Okay, let's check out Router2.

182
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:41,720
FastEthernet0/0 is correct, and FastEthernet0/1
is correct as well.

183
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,440
Now let's check out the switches.

184
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,190
Oh, I'm getting an update for NetSim, I will
not download that now.

185
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:53,720
Okay, ASW1, it has an IP address in VLAN1.

186
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,320
SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.

187
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,820
And the address is correct.

188
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,700
How about ASW2?

189
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,780
The address is correct.

190
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,600
Okay, next the distribution switches.

191
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,480
ENABLE.

192
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,470
SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.

193
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,010
VLAN1, looks good.

194
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:24,850
FastEthernet3,4,5 look good.

195
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,730
And HSRP, I guess we will configure later.

196
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:34,990
Next one, DSW2.

197
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,240
The VLAN1 address is correct.

198
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,980
And FastEthernet3,4 and 5 are correct also.

199
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,920
Okay, last up, the two clients, the two PCs.

200
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,610
So, to check the IP address here let's use
IPCONFIG.

201
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:56,620
IP address 3.30, looks good.

202
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,080
The default gateway is 3.3, which is correct.

203
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:06,800
And I guess later we will change this to use
the HSRP address as the default gateway.

204
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,960
Okay, finally I'll check on Client2.

205
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,940
IPCONFIG.

206
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,350
IP address 3.30, or sorry, 3.40.

207
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,280
Okay, and default gateway 3.2.

208
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,080
Looks good.

209
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,480
Okay, so step 2, verify that Client1 can ping
DSW1's VLAN1 interface.

210
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,630
Okay, I'll go back to Client1.

211
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,700
172.16.3.3.

212
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:39,230
Alright, we're getting a reply so no problems
there.

213
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,910
And how about Client2, can it ping DSW2's
VLAN1 interface?

214
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,790
PING 172.16.3.2.

215
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:51,840
Okay, looks good.

216
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,950
And then verify that Client1 and Client2 can
ping Router1's FastEthernet0/0 interface.

217
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:04,520
Okay, PING 172.16.253.2.

218
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,200
Okay, looks good.

219
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:15,940
I'll do the same back on Client1.

220
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,140
Okay.

221
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:23,400
Router1's FastEthernet0/0 interface, oh it's
not labelled here.

222
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,200
Okay, well we can ping it so, it's not a problem.

223
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,260
Actually let me use CDP to see what's connected
here.

224
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,280
This is a command we'll cover later in the
course.

225
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,230
SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS.

226
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:41,750
Okay, so FastEthernet0/0 is the one connected
to DSW1, here.

227
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:47,460
And FastEthernet0/1 is the one connected to
DSW2, got it.

228
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,000
Okay, that's task 1.

229
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,630
We verified basic connectivity.

230
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:55,190
Task 2, configure HSRP.

231
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:00,800
So on DSW1 and DSW2, create an HSRP group
with a group number of 3 and an IP address

232
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,750
of 172.16.3.1.

233
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,810
Okay, so this is something a little different.

234
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:13,060
The distribution switches are going to be
the default gateways for the clients, for

235
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,620
the subnet.

236
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,610
So instead of configuring HSRP on the routers,
like I said earlier, we're actually going

237
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:24,860
to configure it the distribution switches,
and you can do that on Layer 3 switches.

238
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,530
Okay good, so this will be something a little
different.

239
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:31,040
Okay, so here on DSW1.

240
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,650
CONF T. And what is the interface?

241
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,650
It's VLAN 1, right?

242
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,330
DO SHOW VLAN BRIEF.

243
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:43,190
Yeah, everything's in VLAN 1.

244
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,920
Or, DO SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.

245
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,700
Do that once more.

246
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,940
Yeah, VLAN 1, okay.

247
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,760
So, INTERFACE VLAN 1.

248
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,280
STANDBY, and we're using group number 3.

249
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:04,439
So, STANDBY 3 IP 172.16.3.1.

250
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:05,709
And that's it.

251
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:09,030
Next, DSW2, same thing.

252
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,110
CONF T. INTERFACE VLAN 1.

253
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:21,600
STANDBY 3 IP 172.16.3.1.

254
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,080
Okay, next workstations and access layer switches
should use the newly configured HSRP IP address

255
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,280
as their default gateway.

256
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,240
On Client1 and Client2, configure the default
gateway to be 172.16.3.1.

257
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:41,000
Okay, so to do this we have to use a special
command for NetSim.

258
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,390
That is this, IPCONFIG /DG.

259
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,120
That is not a Cisco command, that is a command
used on PCs in NetSim.

260
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:56,500
So, IPCONFIG /DG 172.16.3.1.

261
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,500
Okay, and Client2.

262
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,680
IPCONFIG /DG 172.16.3.1.

263
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,180
And let me just check with IPCONFIG.

264
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:12,860
Yep, looks good.

265
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:19,960
Okay next, on ASW1 and ASW2, configure the
default gateway to be 172.16.3.1.

266
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,240
Okay, so this is again something I haven't
covered in the course.

267
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,240
So, ASW1 and ASW2 are Layer 2 switches.

268
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,440
However, even on Layer 2 switches they are
able to have one IP address.

269
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,480
Sorry about that, one IP address for management,
so you can connect to that IP address and

270
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,900
access the CLI of the device.

271
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,300
I will explain this later in the course.

272
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,870
But they don't have a routing table.

273
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:52,780
So, to specify the default gateway you can't
configure a default route, you have to use

274
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,460
this command.

275
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:02,480
IP DEFAULT-GATEWAY, and then put in the IP
address, 172.16.3.1.

276
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,490
Okay, and I will do the same on ASW2.

277
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:14,480
CONF T...oops, CONF T. IPCONFIG, nope, that
is the PCs.

278
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,100
IP DEFAULT-GATEWAY 172.16.3.1.

279
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,600
There it is.

280
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:27,230
Okay, so next we would go on to verify our HSRP
configuration and do some more advanced configuration

281
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,650
like priorities and preemption.

282
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,760
But we'll end it here.

283
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:36,410
Now, just out of curiosity I want to grade
the lab and see if we did the configurations

284
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,410
correctly.

285
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,060
It won't say that we completed the entire
lab correctly because haven't finished it

286
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,090
yet, but let's see how we did.

287
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,170
So click on 'grade lab' here.

288
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,420
And as expected, 'you missed one or more commands
in the lab'.

289
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,720
That's okay, we didn't finish it yet.

290
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,250
So Client1 and Client2, the configuration
is correct.

291
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,520
So that means we configured the default gateway
correctly.

292
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,350
ASW1 and ASW2, same.

293
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,230
The configurations are correct.

294
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:07,190
So that means our...here, IP DEFAULT-GATEWAY
command was correct.

295
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:12,330
DSW1 and DSW2, we are missing commands.

296
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,190
Yeah, priority and preemption.

297
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:22,020
However, the STANDBY 3 IP command is correct,
so that means we did that step correctly.

298
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,860
Okay, so that's a quick look at Boson NetSim.

299
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,930
