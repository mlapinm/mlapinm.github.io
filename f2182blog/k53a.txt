lab we will troubleshoot inter VLAN
routing in these 2 small networks 24.991082 which
we just configured in the previous lab 27.470603 I
have made one miss configuration on each
networking device 31.693791 see if you can find
and fix the errors 34.819666 first let's test the
network of PC one switch 1 and PC 2 42.128041 I'll
try a ping from PC 1 in VLAN 10 to PC 2
in VLAN 20 48.546457 ping 10.0.2.10
it fails 59.363061 let's investigate on switch one
61.703019 enable show IP interface brief 68.612935 looks
like the VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 interfaces
have the correct IP addresses configured
74.734310 show VLAN brief 77.801518 here's our problem
80.925476 the fastethernet 0/1 interface to which
pc one is connected has been placed in
VLAN 11 not VLAN 10
88.333267 let's put f01 into the correct VLAN and
see if that solves our issue 94.071517 conf t
interface f01 switch port access VLAN 10
102.148767 I'll delete VLAN 11 also since we're not
using it 106.429829 exit no VLAN 11 do show VLAN
brief 114.403454 ok
our VLAN configuration looks good 117.197787 let's
try that ping from pc1 again 119.642662 ping 10.0.2.10 this time the ping is successful 129.678995 so
we have fixed the issue on this network
132.745953 now let's test the issue on the next
network 136.674848 I'll try to ping from PC 3 in
VLAN 30 to pc 4 in VLAN 40 143.479618 ping 10.0.4.10
the ping is not successful 155.479513 so let's find
the issues there should be one issue on
r2 and one issue on switch 2
according to the lab instructions 163.502117 I'll
investigate on our two first 166.339887 enable
there could be a few problems here like
incorrect IP addresses or encapsulation
dot1q configurations on the sub
interfaces 177.838699 I'll use show running config
this time 181.134157 show run our interface Gigabit
Ethernet 0 0 is not shutdown and 2 sub
interfaces are configured 190.755052 they are
assigned to the proper VLANs 30 and 40
however look at the IP address on the
dot 30 sub-interface 198.040156 the VLAN 30 subnet
is 10.0.3.0 / 24 204.193593 so we should fix that
conf t interface g0 0.30 IP address 10.0.3.1 255 255 255 0 220.132655 do show IP interface
brief 224.002592 ok now it has the correct IP
address so we fixed the issue on r2
229.491717 let's go to switch 2 next 233.948717 enable so the
correct configuration on switch 2 should
be f01 connected to pc 3 in VLAN 30 and
f0 2 connected to pc 4 in VLAN 40 248.734071 and
g0 1 connected to r2 should be a trunk
253.174133 let's check 255.386945 show VLAN brief fast
ethernet 0 1 & 0 2 are in the correct
VLANs 263.318049 show interfaces trunk 266.562049 however
nothing appears with the show interfaces
trunk command 270.489069 show run
272.703735 there's our problem Gigabit Ethernet 0 1
is configured as an access port 281.473860 actually
in the previous show VLAN brief command
you could see it in VLAN 1 that means it
won't pass data from either VLAN 30 or
VLAN 40
292.524901 let's properly configure it as a trunk
296.068109 conf t interface g0 1 switch port mode
trunk 303.087254 do show interfaces trunk 307.201609 ok now we
can see the gig 0 1 interface is a trunk
312.259338 and let's check that VLAN configuration
once more 315.133441 do show VLAN brief 318.338254 it is also
no longer listed in VLAN 1 322.186524 so our inter
VLAN routing in this network should be
properly configured 327.474607 let's try that ping
again once more from PC 3 to PC 4 333.505919 ping
10.0.4.10
okay this time the ping works
348.587710 we have successfully fixed the problems
