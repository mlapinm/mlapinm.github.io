welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab you can download the lab

supporting me via my patreon or the

cryptocurrency options in the

description in this lab we will take

another look at port security although

we will certainly revisit it again this

lab will be the final one in this

introductory series in the previous lab

we configured sticky MAC address

learning however this time we will

manually configure the MAC addresses of

pc1 & pc2 as secure MAC addresses on

switch 1 and switch 2 respectively step

one is to ping from pc1 to pc2 to

generate traffic let's go on pc one ping

192.168.1.2 elv there we go step two is

to view the MAC address table of switch

one switch one should have dynamically

learned the MAC address of PC one on f0

2 and the MAC addresses of switch 2 and

PC 2 on f0 one let's check on switch 1

enable show MAC address table as

expected there are two MAC addresses on

F 0 1 and 1 MAC address on F 0 2 we

don't know which of the two addresses on

F 0 1 is switch 2 and which is PC 2 but

that doesn't matter in this lab we just

want to know the MAC address of PC 1

which is this

step three is to enable port security on

switch ones

f02 interface and manually configure PC

ones MAC address as a secure MAC address

first let me copy the MAC address of PC

one there we go now let's configure the

f02 interface comte interface f0 to

remember we have to configure it as an

access port first so switch port mode

access switch port port security okay

we've done that before now to manually

configure a secure MAC address we use

this command switch port port security

MAC address followed by the MAC address

we want to configure which I will paste

right here there we go

next we must repeat the process on

switch 2 for PC 2 now the MAC address of

PC 2 should already be in the MAC

address table of switch to the default

aging time of a MAC address in the MAC

address table is 5 minutes meaning if

nothing is heard from that address on

the interface for 5 minutes it is

cleared from the table each time a

packet from that address is received the

timer resets to 5 minutes however let's

ping from PC to 2 PC one just in case

ping 192.168.1.1 there we go now under

switch to enable show MAC address table

again there are two addresses on the f01

interface those of switch one and pc 1

and 1 on the f02 interface that of pc 2

which is the one we're interested in now

so I'll copy that

ok now let's configure the interface

coffee interface f0 to switch port mode

access switch port port security switch

port port security MAC address and now

I'll paste in PC twos MAC address there

we go now let's do a quick ping from pc1

to pc2 to test which is step 5

if we configure the correct addresses

there should be no problems ping

192.168.1.2 elv it works

now on step 6 we're going to try to

trigger a port security violation let's

remove the cables first which we can do

with this tool in packet tracer there we

go now I'll connect PC one to switch to

by clicking on the cable down here there

we go and now I'll connect PC two to

switch one there we go

step seven is to pin from pc1 to pc2

what do you expect will be the result of

this ping we manually configured the MAC

address of PC 1 as a secure MAC address

on switch ones f02 interface and

manually configured the MAC address of

PC 2 as a secure MAC address on switch

twos f02 interface remember the default

number of secure MAC addresses on the

port security enabled interface is 1 so

if we attempt a ping from pc1 to pc2 now

a port security violation should be

triggered when the packet with a

different MAC address is received on the

port security enabled interface what

exactly will happen if you remember from

a previous lab the default action in the

event of a port security violation is

shut down meaning that the switch port

will enter an error disabled state

effectively shutting it down let's try

that ping on PC 1 ping 192.168.1 12 as

you can see the ping fails also if you

check the port lights on packet tracer

you'll notice that the port light on the

f02 interface of switch 2 has gone red

this means it is shut down however why

hasn't the f02 interface of switch 1

been shut down this is because the

packet was stopped right at the f02

interface of switch 2 so it never

reached PC 2 and thus PC to never sent a

reply to the ping which would have

triggered a port security violation on

switch 1 step 8 is to reconnect the

cables so I'll remove these cables first

there we go now let's connect them as

they were originally pc 1 2 switch 1

there we go and now pc 2 to switch 2

there we go

you

now let's ping from pc1 to pc2 do you

expect a pin to work PC one is once

again connected to switch ones

f02 interface and its MAC address is

configured on the interface as a secure

address so it should be fine

likewise for PC 2 it is now connected

again to switch twos f02 interface and

its MAC address is configured as a

secure address on switch twos

f02 interface let's try that ping on PC

one ping 192.168.1.2 12 it doesn't work

why is that even though we connected the

cables back the way they are supposed to

be well switch twos f02 interface is

still down it doesn't automatically

recover and become enabled again it can

be configured to automatically recover

from a port security error but that will

be a topic for another lab for now let's

do it manually I'll go on switch to and

first let's check the status of the

interface show interface f02

as you can see here the interface is

down and it's in an error disabled State

how do we manually fix this it's simple

shutdown no shutdown this will reset the

interface and it will no longer be in an

error disabled State that's how you

manually recover an error disabled

interface with the command shutdown

followed by no shutdown

finally let's do one last ping from pc1

to pc2 just to make sure that everything

is working right again after we did that

little experiment with port security

violations I'll go on PC one one more

time ping 192.168.1 twelve it works
