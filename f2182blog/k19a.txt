in this lab we will take another look at port security
21.878361
although we will certainly revisit it again
25.311654
this lab will be the final one in this introductory series
28.752842
in the previous lab we configured sticky MAC address learning
33.602904
however this time we will manually configure the MAC addresses of pc1 & pc2 as secure MAC addresses on switch 1 and switch 2 respectively
44.957764
step one is to ping from pc1 to pc2 2 generate traffic
52.74062
let's go on pc one
54.819091
ping 192.168.1.12
60.786883
there we go
62.431795
step two is to view the MAC address table of switch one
67.360461
switch one should have dynamically learned the MAC address of PC one on f0 2
73.229033
and the MAC addresses of switch 2 and PC 2 on f0 1
77.807698
let's check on switch 1
80.037421
enable show MAC address table
84.784435
as expected there are two MAC addresses on F 0 1 and 1 MAC address on F 0 2
91.764687
we don't know which of the two addresses on F 0 1 is switch 2 and which is PC 2
98.982553
but that doesn't matter in this lab
101.054749
we just want to know the MAC address of PC 1
103.784198
which is this
105.141063
step three is to enable port security on switch ones f02 interface
114.395773
and manually configure PC ones MAC address as a secure MAC address
118.494656
first let me copy the MAC address of PC one
122.972171
there we go now let's configure the f02 interface
127.844823
conf t interface f0 2
132.50079
remember we have to configure it as an access port first
136.651881
so switch port mode access switch port port security
142.164891
okay we've done that before
144.377964
now to manually configure a secure MAC address we use this command
148.910675
switch port port security MAC address followed by the MAC address we want to configure
154.948723
which I will paste right here
156.839176
there we go
159.017969
next we must repeat the process on switch 2 for PC 2
167.008284
now the MAC address of PC 2 should already be in the MAC address table of switch 2
173.387574
the default aging time of a MAC address in the MAC address table is 5 minutes
178.937737
meaning if nothing is heard from that address on the interface for 5 minutes
183.124117
it is cleared from the table
185.321977
each time a packet from that address is received the timer resets to 5 minutes
191.016553
however let's ping from PC to 2 PC one just in case
195.189264
ping 192.168.1.12
201.171544
there we go
203.253126
now under switch 2
207.177134
enable show MAC address table
211.6531
again there are two addresses on the f01 interface
215.851521
those of switch 1 and pc 1 and 1 on the f02 interface
220.282994
that of pc 2
221.952112
which is the one we're interested in now
224.31131
so I'll copy that
225.822703
ok now let's configure the interface
230.61247
conf t interface f0 2 switch port mode access switch port port security switch port port security MAC address and now I'll paste in PC 2 MAC address
246.147486
there we go
248.245714
now let's do a quick ping from pc1 to pc2 to test
253.136939
which is step 5
254.564681
if we configure the correct addresses there should be no problems
258.781179
ping 192.168.1.12 it works
266.092088
now on step 6 we're going to try to trigger a port security violation
273.631862
let's remove the cables first
275.772892
which we can do with this tool in packet tracer
278.772661
there we go now I'll connect PC one to switch to by clicking on the cable down here
288.779013
there we go and now I'll connect PC two to switch one
295.660237
there we go
298.935887
step seven is to ping from pc1 to pc2
305.211508
what do you expect will be the result of this ping
309.193178
we manually configured the MAC address of PC 1 as a secure MAC address on switch ones f02 interface
316.887278
and manually configured the MAC address of PC 2 as a secure MAC address on switch twos f02 interface
324.741179
remember the default number of secure MAC addresses on the port security enabled interface is 1
331.986455
so if we attempt a ping from pc1 to pc2 now
336.556598
a port security violation should be triggered when the packet with a different MAC address is received on the port security enabled interface
344.728699
what exactly will happen
347.688827
if you remember from a previous lab the default action in the event of a port security violation is shut down
354.409897
meaning that the switch port will enter an error disabled state
357.610322
effectively shutting it down
359.437648
let's try that ping on PC 1
362.869803
ping 192.168.1 12 as you can see the ping fails
371.172863
also if you check the port lights on packet tracer
375.184603
you'll notice that the port light on the f02 interface of switch 2 has gone red
379.838564
this means it is shut down
382.730312
however why hasn't the f02 interface of switch 1 been shut down
387.893378
this is because the packet was stopped right at the f02 interface of switch 2
393.558707
so it never reached PC 2 and thus PC to never sent a reply to the ping
398.862798
which would have triggered a port security violation on switch 1
403.250929
step 8 is to reconnect the cables
409.919094
so I'll remove these cables first
412.955113
there we go now let's connect them as they were originally
419.582863
pc 1 switch 1
423.604938
there we go and now pc 2 to switch 2 there we go
432.569194
you now let's ping from pc1 to pc2
438.091024
do you expect a ping too work
440.965717
PC one is once again connected to switch ones f02 interface
445.840699
and its MAC address is configured on the interface as a secure address
450.097201
so it should be fine
451.627587
likewise for PC 2 it is now connected again to switch twos f02 interface
458.201929
and its MAC address is configured as a secure address on switch twos f02 interface
463.778108
let's try that ping on PC one
467.340186
ping 192.168.1.12
471.428797
it doesn't work
475.192785
why is that even though we connected the cables back the way they are supposed to be
480.662842
well switch twos f02 interface is still down
485.807246
it doesn't automatically recover and become enabled again
489.79431
it can be configured to automatically recover from a port security error
495.116752
but that will be a topic for another lab
497.525238
for now let's do it manually
500.416335
I'll go on switch 2
502.974416
and first let's check the status of the interface
507.676155
show interface f02
511.397494
as you can see here the interface is down
515.878198
and it's in an error disabled State
518.548093
how do we manually fix this
522.052855
it's simple
523.681029
shutdown no shutdown
527.97717
this will reset the interface and it will no longer be in an error disabled State
534.473503
that's how you manually recover an error disabled interface with the command shutdown followed by no shutdown
541.765898
finally let's do one last ping from pc1 to pc2
551.429449
just to make sure that everything is working right again
553.996027
after we did that little experiment with port security violations
557.377987
I'll go on PC one one more time
561.15042
ping 192.168.1.12
566.333083
it works
569.403244
that's all for this lab
