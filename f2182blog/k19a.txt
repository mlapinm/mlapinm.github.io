description 16.302715in this lab we will take

another look at port security 21.878361although

we will certainly revisit it again 25.311654this

lab will be the final one in this

introductory series 28.752842in the previous lab

we configured sticky MAC address

learning 33.602904however this time we will

manually configure the MAC addresses of

pc1 & pc2 as secure MAC addresses on

switch 1 and switch 2 respectively 44.957764step

one is to ping from pc1 to pc2 2

generate traffic 52.74062let's go on pc one 54.819091ping

192.168.1.12 60.786883there we go 62.431795step two is

to view the MAC address table of switch

one 67.360461switch one should have dynamically

learned the MAC address of PC one on f0

2 73.229033and the MAC addresses of switch 2 and

PC 2 on f0 1 77.807698let's check on switch 1
80.037421
enable show MAC address table 84.784435as

expected there are two MAC addresses on

F 0 1 and 1 MAC address on F 0 2 91.764687we

don't know which of the two addresses on

F 0 1 is switch 2 and which is PC 2 98.982553but

that doesn't matter in this lab 101.054749we just

want to know the MAC address of PC 1
103.784198
which is this
105.141063
step three is to enable port security on

switch ones

f02 interface 114.395773and manually configure PC

ones MAC address as a secure MAC address
118.494656
first let me copy the MAC address of PC

one 122.972171there we go now let's configure the

f02 interface 127.844823 conf t interface f0 2
132.50079
remember we have to configure it as an

access port first 136.651881so switch port mode

access switch port port security 142.164891okay

we've done that before 144.377964now to manually

configure a secure MAC address we use

this command 148.910675switch port port security

MAC address followed by the MAC address

we want to configure 154.948723which I will paste

right here 156.839176there we go
159.017969
next we must repeat the process on

switch 2 for PC 2 167.008284now the MAC address of

PC 2 should already be in the MAC

address table of switch 2 173.387574the default

aging time of a MAC address in the MAC

address table is 5 minutes 178.937737meaning if

nothing is heard from that address on

the interface for 5 minutes 183.124117it is

cleared from the table 185.321977each time a

packet from that address is received the

timer resets to 5 minutes 191.016553however let's

ping from PC to 2 PC one just in case
195.189264
ping 192.168.1.12 201.171544there we go 203.253126now under

switch 2 207.177134enable show MAC address table
211.6531
again there are two addresses on the f01

interface 215.851521those of switch 1 and pc 1

and 1 on the f02 interface 220.282994that of pc 2
221.952112
which is the one we're interested in now
224.31131
so I'll copy that
225.822703
ok now let's configure the interface
230.61247
conf t interface f0 2 switch port mode

access switch port port security switch

port port security MAC address and now

I'll paste in PC 2 MAC address 246.147486there

we go 248.245714now let's do a quick ping from pc1

to pc2 to test 253.136939which is step 5
254.564681
if we configure the correct addresses

there should be no problems 258.781179ping

192.168.1.12 it works
266.092088
now on step 6 we're going to try to

trigger a port security violation 273.631862let's

remove the cables first 275.772892which we can do

with this tool in packet tracer 278.772661there we

go now I'll connect PC one to switch to

by clicking on the cable down here 288.779013there

we go and now I'll connect PC two to

switch one 295.660237there we go
298.935887
step seven is to ping from pc1 to pc2
305.211508
what do you expect will be the result of

this ping 309.193178we manually configured the MAC

address of PC 1 as a secure MAC address

on switch ones f02 interface 316.887278and

manually configured the MAC address of

PC 2 as a secure MAC address on switch

twos f02 interface 324.741179remember the default

number of secure MAC addresses on the

port security enabled interface is 1 331.986455so

if we attempt a ping from pc1 to pc2 now
336.556598
a port security violation should be

triggered when the packet with a

different MAC address is received on the

port security enabled interface 344.728699what

exactly will happen 347.688827if you remember from

a previous lab the default action in the

event of a port security violation is

shut down 354.409897meaning that the switch port

will enter an error disabled state
357.610322
effectively shutting it down 359.437648let's try

that ping on PC 1 362.869803ping 192.168.1 12 as

you can see the ping fails 371.172863also if you

check the port lights on packet tracer
375.184603
you'll notice that the port light on the

f02 interface of switch 2 has gone red
379.838564
this means it is shut down 382.730312however why

hasn't the f02 interface of switch 1

been shut down 387.893378this is because the

packet was stopped right at the f02

interface of switch 2 393.558707so it never

reached PC 2 and thus PC to never sent a

reply to the ping 398.862798which would have

triggered a port security violation on

switch 1 403.250929step 8 is to reconnect the

cables 409.919094so I'll remove these cables first
412.955113
there we go now let's connect them as

they were originally 419.582863pc 1  switch 1
423.604938
there we go and now pc 2 to switch 2

there we go
432.569194
you

now let's ping from pc1 to pc2 438.091024do you

expect a ping too work 440.965717PC one is once

again connected to switch ones

f02 interface 445.840699and its MAC address is

configured on the interface as a secure

address 450.097201so it should be fine
451.627587
likewise for PC 2 it is now connected

again to switch twos f02 interface 458.201929and

its MAC address is configured as a

secure address on switch twos

f02 interface 463.778108let's try that ping on PC

one 467.340186ping 192.168.1.12 471.428797it doesn't work
475.192785
why is that even though we connected the

cables back the way they are supposed to

be 480.662842well switch twos f02 interface is

still down 485.807246it doesn't automatically

recover and become enabled again 489.79431it can

be configured to automatically recover

from a port security error 495.116752but that will

be a topic for another lab 497.525238for now let's

do it manually 500.416335I'll go on switch 2 502.974416and

first let's check the status of the

interface 507.676155show interface f02
511.397494
as you can see here the interface is

down 515.878198and it's in an error disabled State
518.548093
how do we manually fix this 522.052855it's simple
523.681029
shutdown no shutdown 527.97717this will reset the

interface and it will no longer be in an

error disabled State 534.473503that's how you

manually recover an error disabled

interface with the command shutdown

followed by no shutdown
541.765898
finally let's do one last ping from pc1

to pc2 551.429449just to make sure that everything

is working right again 553.996027after we did that

little experiment with port security

violations 557.377987I'll go on PC one one more

time 561.15042ping 192.168.1.12 566.333083it works
569.403244
