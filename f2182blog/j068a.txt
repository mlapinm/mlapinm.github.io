00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,120

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,360
Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:26,060
In this video we will cover two Layer 2 discovery
protocols, CDP and LLDP.

8
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,410
You might not have heard of a Layer 2 discovery
protocol before, but I’ll explain what they

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,160
are in this video.

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:40,170
CDP and LLDP are exam topic 2.3, which says
you must be able to configure and verify Layer

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,110
2 discovery protocols CDP and LLDP.

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:50,370
CDP and LLDP are important topics for the
CCNA, but there’s not as much information

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,129
to absorb compared to topics like ACLs, IPv6,
and OSPF.

14
00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:58,829
So, hopefully this video will be a little
easier to get through.

15
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,660
Here’s what we’ll cover in this video.

16
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,930
First I’ll give a brief overview of Layer
2 discovery protocols.

17
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,149
Then I’ll cover Cisco Discovery Protocol,
CDP.

18
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:14,979
Finally I’ll cover Link Layer Discovery
Protocol, LLDP.

19
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:20,780
CDP and LLDP are very similar in terms of
function and configuration, but there are

20
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,520
some key differences.

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,280
Watch until the end of today’s video for
a bonus practice question from Boson Software’s

22
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,740
ExSim for CCNA.

23
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:36,140
ExSim simulates the style and difficulty of
the real CCNA exam better than any other practice

24
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,740
exams, and I highly recommend ExSim to anyone
preparing for the CCNA.

25
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,929
Let’s get started with a brief intro to
Layer 2 discovery protocols.

26
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:53,020
Layer 2 discovery protocols such as CDP and
LLDP share information with, and discover

27
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,070
information about, neighboring (connected)
devices.

28
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,619
They are called ‘Layer 2’ discovery protocols
because the protocols themselves operate at

29
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,590
Layer 2, they don’t use IP addresses.

30
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,800
We’ll look at some Wireshark captures later,
and you’ll see that there are no IP packets

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,930
inside of the frames sent by CDP and LLDP.

32
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:20,010
Although they are Layer 2 discovery protocols,
they can be used to share layer 3 information

33
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,170
such as IP addresses too.

34
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:29,440
The shared information includes host name,
IP address, device type, etc.

35
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,019
CDP is a Cisco proprietary protocol, developed
by Cisco for Cisco devices.

36
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:41,750
LLDP is an industry standard protocol, IEEE
802.1AB.

37
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:47,299
So, if your network uses only Cisco devices
CDP is fine.

38
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:53,459
However if there is a mix of vendors, for
example Cisco routers, Juniper switches, and

39
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:59,349
Palo Alto firewalls, you will have to use
LLDP if you want to use a Layer 2 discovery

40
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:00,920
protocol in your network.

41
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,860
However, because these protocols share information
about the devices in the network, they can

42
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,870
be considered a security risk and are often
not used.

43
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,130
It’s up to the network engineer or admin
to decide if they want to use them in the

44
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,690
network or not.

45
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,350
At my workplace, for example, we always disable
these protocols, but I’m sure many networks

46
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,500
make use of them.

47
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,739
To demonstrate how these protocols work, here
are two devices, R1 and SW1, directly connected.

48
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:35,830
R1 will periodically send frames to SW1, telling
it information like R1’s hostname, device

49
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,660
type, interface ID, IP address, etc.

50
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,610
SW1 will do the same, periodically sending
frames to R1.

51
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,500
Note that SW1 doesn’t include an IP address
in the information it sends to R1, because

52
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,650
it’s a switch.

53
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,860
Its interface doesn’t have an IP address.

54
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,269
So let’s move on to talk about CDP specifically.

55
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:03,400
To repeat, CDP is a Cisco proprietary protocol.

56
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,220
It is enabled on Cisco devices by default.

57
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:12,740
For example Cisco routers, Cisco switches,
Cisco firewalls, Cisco IP phones, etc.

58
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:16,370
All of these devices have CDP enabled by default.

59
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:25,860
CDP messages are periodically sent to multicast
MAC address 0100 0CCC CCCC.

60
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,050
Remember that MAC address, it will be in the
flashcards.

61
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:37,080
I know the MAC addresses used by different
protocols such as CDP, STP, PVST, HSRP, VRRP,

62
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,940
etc are difficult to memorize.

63
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,030
The Anki flashcards are very helpful for this.

64
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:48,470
You can add a specific tag to these MAC address
cards, and use the tag to review those specific

65
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,580
cards whenever you want.

66
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,570
This will help you remember all of these MAC
addresses, and which is used for which protocol.

67
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:00,400
Anyway, if you want to learn Anki functions
like that do a Google search, let’s continue

68
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,750
with CDP.

69
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,110
Because the messages use a multicast MAC address
you might think the message is forwarded to

70
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,860
multiple devices, but it isn’t.

71
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:15,030
When a device receives a CDP message, it processes
and discards the message.

72
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,389
It does not forward it to other devices.

73
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:23,240
So, only directly connected neighbors can
become CDP neighbors.

74
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,820
By default, CDP messages are sent once every
60 seconds, out of all interfaces which are

75
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,130
in an up state.

76
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:36,380
These are the messages that contain the information
like host name, IP address, etc, that I summarized

77
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:43,169
in the previous When a device receives these
CDP messages from a neighboring device, it

78
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:47,490
adds an entry for the device in its CDP neighbor
table.

79
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,729
If a neighbor is disconnected, there is a
default CDP holdtime of 180 seconds.

80
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:58,800
So, if a message isn’t received from a neighbor
for 180 seconds, the neighbor is removed from

81
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,210
the CDP neighbor table.

82
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,509
This makes sure the CDP neighbor table doesn’t
have entries from old neighbors which used

83
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:08,240
to be connected, but no longer are.

84
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,289
CDP version 2 messages are sent by default.

85
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:18,320
There are two versions of CDP, version 1 and
version 2, but version 2 is used by default.

86
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,509
CDP version 1 is very old so you’ll probably
never need to use it.

87
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:28,100
You don’t need to know the differences between
version 1 and version 2, but basically version

88
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,940
2 provides a few more advanced features like
the ability to identify native VLAN mismatches.

89
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:40,660
Okay let’s get right into the CLI to see
exactly what information is shared by CDP.

90
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,550
To demonstrate CDP, as well as LLDP later,
I’ll use this network.

91
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:50,470
Two routers and two multilayer switches, although
I’m not using any Layer 3 functions on the

92
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,420
switches.

93
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:58,190
Before looking at the CDP neighbor table,
here are a few other basic CDP show commands.

94
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:05,750
SHOW CDP tells us the CDP timer, 60 seconds
by default, the CDP holdtime, 180 seconds

95
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:12,800
by default, and it also shows which version
of CDP is being used, version 2 by default.

96
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,930
Note that if CDP isn’t enabled on the device,
you’ll get a message like this when you

97
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:21,780
try to use the SHOW CDP command: CDP is not
enabled.

98
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,410
Okay, next I used the command SHOW CDP TRAFFIC.

99
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:31,770
This command tells us how many CDP packets,
how many CDP advertisements, the device has

100
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,220
sent and received.

101
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:41,100
At the time that I used this command, R1 had
sent 105 CDP messages and received 112 CDP

102
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:46,500
messages, and all of those messages were CDP
version 2 messages.

103
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,750
Finally, you can use the SHOW CDP INTERFACE
command, which gives some basic information

104
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,889
about each interface.

105
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:58,009
You can also specify a certain interface when
entering the command, but if you just enter

106
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:02,320
SHOW CDP INTERFACE you’ll get information
about all interfaces.

107
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,639
Here you can see the info for G0/0.

108
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,990
You can see the same CDP message timer and
holdtime as above, but what does ‘encapsulation

109
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,909
ARPA’ mean?

110
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:16,389
ARPA is actually a type of Ethernet encapsulation.

111
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:20,860
I haven’t talked about the different types
of Ethernet in this course, I’m pretty sure

112
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,010
that’s beyond the scope of the CCNA, but
I just wanted to point that out because I’m

113
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,650
sure some of you would be wondering about
it.

114
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:32,490
This type of Ethernet is also known as Ethernet
2, so if you want to learn more try a Google

115
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,910
search for Ethernet 2.

116
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:41,000
Okay, finally down here you can see a basic
summary of how many interfaces are CDP-enabled,

117
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,110
and how many interfaces are in an up state
and a down state.

118
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:54,070
So, remember these three commands, SHOW CDP,
SHOW CDP TRAFFIC, and SHOW CDP INTERFACE.

119
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,140
Finally let’s look at the CDP neighbor table.

120
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,960
Here it is, on R1 I used the command SHOW
CDP NEIGHBORS to view it.

121
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,980
Let’s look at what you can learn from this
command.

122
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,710
First, the ‘device ID’ column lists the
host name of each of R1’s CDP neighbors.

123
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:16,790
So, R1 has received CDP messages from SW1
and R2.

124
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,480
Next is the ‘local interface’ column.

125
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,080
This states the interface on the local device,
on R1.

126
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,290
So, if we didn’t have a proper network diagram
and wanted to know which devices are connected

127
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,100
to which interface on R1, we can use this
command.

128
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:39,980
SW1 is connected to R1’s G0/0 interface,
and R2 is connected to R1’s G0/1 interface,

129
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,560
as shown in the network diagram below.

130
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,790
Next is the holdtime column.

131
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:52,100
This will reset to 180 each time R1 receives
a CDP message from the neighbor.

132
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,820
With the default timers, it should count down
to 120, then R1 will receive a CDP message

133
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,200
and reset it to 180, and that cycle will repeat.

134
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,170
If this timer reaches 0, the neighbor will
be removed from the CDP neighbor table.

135
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,390
Next is the ‘capability’ column.

136
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:14,280
This helps you identify what kind of device
you are connected to.

137
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,610
For example, SW1 has the letters R, S, and
I.

138
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,700
What do these codes mean?

139
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,920
You can check up here.

140
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,980
First off, let me point out that I means IGMP.

141
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,340
This is related to multicast and is beyond
the CCNA, don’t worry about it for now.

142
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:37,150
Then, R means router and S means switch.

143
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:41,440
Switch is obvious, SW1 is a switch, but why
router?

144
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,350
It’s because this is a multilayer switch,
so it has routing capabilities.

145
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,890
That’s why it’s listed as both a router
and a switch.

146
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,500
Now, how about R2?

147
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,630
It has R and B in its capability column.

148
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:01,170
Once again, R stands for router, which is
expected because R2 is a router.

149
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,650
And B means ‘source route bridge’.

150
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:10,168
This is another thing that isn’t necessary
for the CCNA, so don’t worry about memorizing it.

151
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:15,760
So, I recommend just remembering R for router
and S for switch.

152
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,130
Next is the ‘platform’ column.

153
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:21,210
This displays the model of the neighboring
device.

154
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:26,750
As you know, Cisco has various models of routers,
switches, firewalls, etc, and the model will

155
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,410
be displayed here.

156
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:34,440
However, for these lessons I use virtual devices
running in GNS3, and as you can see nothing

157
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,720
is displayed here, since they aren’t physical
devices.

158
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,200
So, let’s refer to Packet Tracer which actually
does display information here.

159
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,550
For example, in the Packet Tracer network
I made, R1 was connected to a C2900 series

160
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:55,180
router, R2, and a catalyst 2960 series switch,
SW1.

161
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,670
Okay, last column is ‘port ID’.

162
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,150
This tells you the port ID on the neighboring
device.

163
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:08,940
So, R1 is connected to SW1’s G0/0 interface
and R2’s G0/0 interface.

164
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,350
Make sure you know the difference between
the ‘local interface’ field, the interface

165
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:17,880
on this device, and the ‘port ID’ field,
the interface on the neighboring device.

166
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,230
Okay, those are all of the fields of SHOW
CDP NEIGHBORS, but there is more information

167
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,920
you can learn via CDP.

168
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:33,580
To view that additional information you can
use this command: SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS DETAIL.

169
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,820
As you can see, more information is displayed
for each neighbor.

170
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,060
For example, here’s SW1’s entry.

171
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,860
Some of the information you can see here that
you couldn’t see with the regular SHOW CDP

172
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:50,000
NEIGHBORS command is the software version,
the version of IOS, running on the neighbor

173
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,880
device.

174
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,440
Because SW1 is a switch, you can also see
VTP information here.

175
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,110
This is something CDP can do but LLDP can’t.

176
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:06,260
VTP is a Cisco proprietary protocol, so only
Cisco’s CDP can share information about

177
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,960
it.

178
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,730
You can also see the native VLAN of SW1’s
interface, currently it’s the default of

179
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,210
1.

180
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,790
The duplex setting of SW1’s interface is
displayed, also.

181
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:24,700
So, with these last two fields CDP helps identify
any mismatches of native VLAN or interface

182
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,860
duplex.

183
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,060
Actually, if a mismatch is found CDP will
display messages on the device to let you

184
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,140
know.

185
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,380
Next here’s R2’s entry.

186
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,830
I just wanted to point out that you can see
R2’s IP address here, 10.0.0.2.

187
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:46,890
SW1 doesn’t have any IP addresses, so none
were displayed above, but the SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS

188
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,990
DETAIL command lets you view the neighbor’s
IP address.

189
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:56,680
Now, if the device has a lot of CDP neighbors
the output of this command can get quite long.

190
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,060
However, there is another command which lets
you view this detailed information for just

191
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,630
a single neighbor.

192
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:09,440
That is this command, SHOW CDP ENTRY, followed
by the neighbor’s host name, I used R2 in

193
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,100
this case.

194
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,930
The output here is exactly the same as in
SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS DETAIL, but it only shows

195
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,170
the specified neighbor.

196
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,980
Here’s a brief summary of each of the commands
I just showed you.

197
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,510
I won’t go over them individually, feel
free to pause the video here if you want to

198
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,480
review them.

199
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,221
Because CDP is enabled by default, if you
want to use CDP in your network you don’t

200
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:38,290
have to do any configuration, you can just
use these SHOW commands.

201
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:43,270
But now let’s take a look at some basic
CDP configurations.

202
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:48,890
As I just said, CDP is globally enabled by
default, Cisco devices have CDP activated

203
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,430
by default.

204
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,390
Each interface also has CDP enabled by default.

205
00:14:54,390 --> 00:15:00,390
If you want to enable or disable CDP globally,
use the CDP RUN command from global config

206
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,660
mode.

207
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:08,450
Use CDP RUN to enable it, which is default,
or NO CDP RUN to disable it.

208
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:14,740
To enable CDP on an interface, which is the
default state, use CDP ENABLE, and use NO

209
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,000
in front of the command to disable it.

210
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,410
These commands are done from interface config
mode.

211
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:26,980
You can configure the CDP timer, how often
CDP messages are sent, with the CDP TIMER

212
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,600
command from global config mode.

213
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,740
You can also configure the holdtime with CDP
HOLDTIME.

214
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:40,360
And you can enable CDP version 2, which is
the default state, with CDP ADVERTISE-V2,

215
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,550
or use NO in front of the command to disable
it and use version 1.

216
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:49,090
You’ll probably never use that last command,
but I included it anyway.

217
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:54,420
So, these are the CDP configuration commands
you should know for the CCNA.

218
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:04,010
CDP RUN, CDP ENABLE, CDP TIMER, CDP HOLDTIME,
and CDP ADVERTISE-V2.

219
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:08,670
Finally let’s move on to LLDP, Link Layer
Discovery Protocol.

220
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:13,810
LLDP is an industry standard protocol, so
many different vendors implement it on their

221
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,180
devices.

222
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:21,830
CDP was the original, and LLDP was later invented
to have an industry standard version.

223
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:27,020
It is usually disabled on Cisco devices by
default, so it must be manually enabled.

224
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:32,330
A device can run CDP and LLDP at the same
time, so you don’t have to choose between

225
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,750
them, although usually you’ll just use one.

226
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,400
Here’s another MAC address to remember.

227
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:46,810
LLDP messages are periodically sent to multicast
MAC address 0180 C200 000E.

228
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:50,930
Again, use the flashcards to remember that
one.

229
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,980
This is the same as for CDP.

230
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,950
When a device receives an LLDP message, it
processes and discards the message.

231
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,050
It does not forward it to other devices.

232
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:05,810
So, only directly connected devices can become
LLDP neighbors.

233
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:11,500
By default, LLDP messages are sent once every
30 seconds, this is half the time of CDP’s

234
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,579
default 60 seconds.

235
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,800
LLDP’s default holdtime is 120 seconds.

236
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,890
LLDP also has an additional timer called the
‘reinitialization delay’.

237
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:27,819
I don’t think you need to know this for
the CCNA, but here’s a very brief explanation.

238
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:33,670
If LLDP is enabled, either globally or on
a specific interface, this timer will delay

239
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:38,880
the actual initialization of LLDP, and the
timer is 2 seconds by default.

240
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,880
I believe the purpose of this timer is to
help in cases of ‘flapping’, when LLDP

241
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,990
is rapidly enabled or disabled for some reason.

242
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:52,770
So, the device won’t send LLDP messages
out of its interfaces immediately when LLDP

243
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,660
is enabled, it will wait for the initialization
timer to expire.

244
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,930
As I said, you probably don’t have to know
that for the CCNA, but you’ll see that timer

245
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:09,370
in the output of the commands I’m going
to show you, so I wanted to give a brief explanation.

246
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:14,240
Because LLDP is disabled by default, before
checking out the SHOW commands let’s see

247
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,450
the configuration commands you should know
for LLDP.

248
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:24,050
To review, LLDP is usually globally disabled
by default, and it’s also disabled on each

249
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,760
interface by default.

250
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,200
So, to enable LLDP you need to enable it globally
and then enable it on each interface.

251
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,680
You’ll see that the interface configuration
is a little different than CDP.

252
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,260
To enable it globally use LLDP RUN.

253
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,650
This is the same as CDP, just replace the
word CDP with LLDP.

254
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,540
If you want to disable it again after, use
NO in front of the command.

255
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,170
Now the interface configurations.

256
00:18:54,170 --> 00:19:02,140
To enable LLDP transmissions, tx, on an interface,
use LLDP TRANSMIT on the interface.

257
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,800
This causes the interface to start sending
LLDP messages.

258
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:11,200
However, it won’t receive LLDP messages,
it will simply discard them.

259
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,790
To enable LLDP in the receive direction, rx,
use the LLDP RECEIVE command on the interface.

260
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:24,320
So, CDP had only one command, CDP ENABLE which
enables the interface to both send and receive

261
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,740
CDP messages.

262
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,200
In LLDP, you need to use two separate commands.

263
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,930
But still, the configuration is quite simple.

264
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,570
Now let’s see how to configure each LLDP
timer.

265
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:43,880
The timer used to send messages is configured
with LLDP TIMER, then the timer in seconds.

266
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,670
The LLDP holdtime is configured with LLDP
HOLDTIME, then the holdtime in seconds.

267
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:55,250
Finally, you can configure the LLDP reinitialization
timer, which I briefly mentioned earlier,

268
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:59,080
with LLDP REINIT, then the timer in seconds.

269
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,920
So, these commands are all fairly similar
to the CDP commands, the biggest difference

270
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,240
is the interface configuration.

271
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,890
Make sure you enable both TRANSMIT and RECEIVE,
unless for some reason you want the interface

272
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:16,510
to only be able to send or receive, not send
and receive, LLDP messages.

273
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:23,610
So, I’ve enabled LLDP on all of these devices
with the command LLDP RUN from global config

274
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:28,800
mode, and LLDP TRANSMIT and RECEIVE on all
interfaces.

275
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,740
They are now running both CDP and LLDP.

276
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:38,040
Usually LLDP would be used in a multi-vendor
network, not just Cisco, but this setup is

277
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,870
good enough for our purposes, to demonstrate
how LLDP works on Cisco devices.

278
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:50,640
So, let’s check out some LLDP show commands,
the LLDP versions of the ones I used for CDP.

279
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:57,360
First, SHOW LLDP gives the same information
as SHOW CDP does for CDP.

280
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,530
It shows that LLDP is enabled, and displays
each of the LLDP timers, which are currently

281
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:07,100
at the default settings of 30, 120, and 2
seconds.

282
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:13,430
Then SHOW LLDP TRAFFIC, similar to SHOW CDP
TRAFFIC, shows statistics about how many LLDP

283
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,150
frames were sent and received.

284
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:22,010
In this case I used the command quickly after
enabling LLDP, only 4 frames have been sent

285
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:25,930
and only 3 have been received by R1.

286
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,870
Then I used SHOW LLDP INTERFACE.

287
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:33,511
This shows whether TRANSMIT and RECEIVE are
enabled or disabled on each interface, as

288
00:21:33,511 --> 00:21:37,039
well as the current Tx and Rx state.

289
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,460
For example, for G0/0 both Tx and Rx are enabled.

290
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:48,320
The Tx state is IDLE, it’s waiting before
it sends the next LLDP frame to SW1.

291
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,820
And the Rx state is WAIT FOR FRAME.

292
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,830
It’s waiting to receive the next LLDP frame
from SW1.

293
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:59,450
Okay, so those commands are very similar to
their CDP equivalents, although there are

294
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,110
some differences in the output.

295
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:05,030
Now let’s check out R1’s LLDP neighbor
table.

296
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:12,320
Here’s R1’s LLDP neighbor table, the command
is SHOW LLDP NEIGHBORS.

297
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,090
First up, the device ID, the host name, of
each neighbor is displayed.

298
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,020
Then the local interface.

299
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,840
Just like in SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS, this is the
interface of the local device, R1 in this

300
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,490
case.

301
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,100
Then the hold time.

302
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,300
This is a little different than in SHOW CDP
NEIGHBORS.

303
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:35,220
In SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS, you could watch the
timer count down from 180, and then reset

304
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,750
to 180 when a CDP message is received.

305
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:43,900
However SHOW LLDP NEIGHBORS simply displays
the holdtime that is configured on this device,

306
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,430
120 seconds.

307
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:50,800
It won’t count down as R1 waits for an LLDP
message from each neighbor.

308
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,930
Then the capability column.

309
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,770
The output here is a little odd.

310
00:22:54,770 --> 00:23:01,880
SW1 shows nothing, and R2 shows R. R means
router, which you would expect from R2, because

311
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,880
it’s a router.

312
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,920
However, why doesn’t the switch capability
display for SW1?

313
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,460
Actually, there is no ‘SWITCH’ capability
code.

314
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,330
Instead, LLDP uses B for Bridge.

315
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:18,210
Remember I told you, in the spanning tree
lessons, that sometimes the word ‘bridge’

316
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,400
is used instead of switch?

317
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,470
Well here’s another case of that.

318
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,130
However, B isn’t displaying for SW1.

319
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:30,730
I think this is just because I’m running
these virtual devices in GNS3, it isn’t

320
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:36,340
detecting that SW1 is an active switch, but
in the next when we look at SHOW LLDP NEIGHBORS

321
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,260
DETAIL you will see this bridge code for SW1.

322
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:45,960
Okay, and just like in SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS,
the last column is the port ID, the interface

323
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,020
ID of the neighboring device.

324
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:54,580
R1 is connected to SW1’s G0/0 interface
and R2’s G0/0 interface.

325
00:23:54,580 --> 00:24:00,120
So, this command is very similar to SHOW CDP
NEIGHBORS, but there are a few differences.

326
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,460
Okay, here’s SHOW LLDP NEIGHBORS DETAIL
on R1.

327
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:10,220
The output is too long to show on one screen,
so R2’s entry is cut off a little at the

328
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,220
bottom.

329
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,720
Let’s check out SW1’s entry.

330
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,670
It gives us additional information like the
operating system version running on SW1.

331
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,510
We can also see the ‘time remaining’.

332
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:25,400
This is the holdtime, if you want to actually
see it counting down for each neighbor you

333
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,090
have to use the DETAIL version of the command.

334
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,340
And here is the main thing I want to show
you.

335
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:38,971
CDP had one field for the device’s capabilities,
but LLDP has two when you use SHOW LLDP NEIGHBORS

336
00:24:38,971 --> 00:24:39,980
DETAIL.

337
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:45,100
‘System capabilities’ and ‘enabled capabilities’.

338
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:51,670
If you look at system capabilities, you can
see B and R. B is for bridge, meaning switch.

339
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,400
And R is for Router.

340
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,320
So, this is what you would expect, because
SW1 is a multilayer switch.

341
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,480
It has the functions of both a router and
a switch.

342
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:08,220
However, in this case the ‘enabled capabilities’
field simply displays ‘not advertised’,

343
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,930
so none of SW1’s capabilities are enabled.

344
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:17,809
If we use the IP ROUTING command on SW1, SW1’s
router functionality will be enabled and the

345
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:22,780
‘R’ from ‘system capabilities’ will
be copied to ‘enabled capabilities’.

346
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,840
However, I think the reason ‘B’ isn’t
displayed next to ‘enabled capabilities’

347
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,880
is simply because SW1 is a virtual device
running in GNS3, it’s not recognized as

348
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,270
an active switch.

349
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:39,290
You don’t have to worry about these details,
but I just wanted to explain why it’s displaying

350
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,260
like this.

351
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:46,180
Note that this command doesn’t display VTP
information like SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS DETAIL

352
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,250
did.

353
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:54,020
VTP is a Cisco-proprietary protocol, so only
Cisco’s proprietary CDP can display info

354
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,820
about VTP.

355
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,059
The industry-standard LLDP can’t.

356
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:03,830
Okay, just like for CDP there is a command
you can use to view the exact same output

357
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:10,900
as SHOW LLDP NEIGHBORS DETAIL, but for a single
neighbor instead of all neighbors.

358
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:16,550
That command is SHOW LLDP ENTRY, followed
by the neighbor’s host name.

359
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:22,080
By the way, before using this command I enabled
IP ROUTING on SW1, and now you can see ‘R’,

360
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,390
for Router, is displayed next to ‘enabled
capabilities’ for SW1.

361
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:32,230
Here’s the same SHOW command summary as
before, but this time for LLDP.

362
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:36,960
The commands are the same, just replace the
word CDP with LLDP.

363
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,710
The output for these commands is similar to
the output for CDP, but as you saw already

364
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,140
there are a few differences.

365
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,140
Pause the video if you want to review these
commands, but let’s move on.

366
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:56,880
Let’s briefly look at a couple Wireshark
captures, one for CDP and one for LLDP.

367
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,680
First, this is a CDP message sent from R1
to SW1.

368
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:10,120
Notice the CDP destination MAC address, 0100.0CCC.CCCC.

369
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:20,430
But notice that Wireshark describes this destination
MAC as CDP/VTP/DTP/PagP/UDLD.

370
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:25,344
That’s because this same multicast MAC address
is actually used for multiple protocols, not

371
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:27,070
just CDP.

372
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:31,440
Now, here’s the actual CDP information.

373
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,890
You can see here that CDP version 2 is being
used.

374
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:40,550
The TTL, time to live, is actually the CDP
holdtime.

375
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:46,250
Here are some other fields such as the device
ID, this is being sent from R1, the version,

376
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,900
platform, addresses, and port ID.

377
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:54,070
I could expand each of these fields in Wireshark
to view more details, but then the capture

378
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,260
wouldn’t fit on one screen,.

379
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:01,350
So I just expanded the capabilities field,
and you can see there is a ‘1’ for ‘Router’

380
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:06,010
and ‘Source Route Bridge’, those are the
capabilities of R1.

381
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:11,470
Finally, notice that there is no IP packet
inside of this Ethernet frame.

382
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:17,760
These Layer 2 discovery protocols don’t
use IP addresses, only MAC addresses.

383
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,760
And here’s an LLDP frame capture, this time
a message that SW1 sent to R1.

384
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:31,170
First up, here’s the destination MAC address
I showed you earlier, 0180.C200.000E.

385
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,880
And here’s the actual LLDP information.

386
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:41,390
The time to live, TTL, is the LLDP holdtime
of 120 seconds, and you can see the system

387
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,870
name, the host name, of the device which sent
this message, SW1.

388
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:49,510
Here’s the LLDP capabilities field.

389
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:54,640
Just like we saw before, SW1’s capabilities
are Bridge and Router, but its only enabled

390
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,400
capability is router.

391
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,100
Okay, you don’t have to look into these
captures in too much detail, I just wanted

392
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:07,670
to show you some real examples of CDP and
LLDP messages.

393
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:12,310
Before moving on to the quiz let’s review
what we studied in today’s video.

394
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:16,720
First I gave a brief intro to Layer 2 discovery
protocols and their purpose.

395
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,000
Basically, they enable directly connected
neighbors to share various information with

396
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,090
each other such as host name, device type,
IP address, software version, etc.

397
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:31,120
They can be very useful and convenient, but
remember that they can also be considered

398
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,300
a security risk because of the information
they share with connected devices.

399
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:40,910
So, many network admins choose to disable
them in their networks.

400
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:45,970
Then I introduced CDP, Cisco’s Layer 2 discovery
protocol.

401
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:51,860
After that I introduced LLDP, which was developed
after CDP as an industry standard alternative.

402
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:58,700
LLDP is supported by many vendors, so if your
network uses a mix of Cisco, Juniper, Palo

403
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:04,830
Alto, Fortinet, whatever, you’ll have to
use LLDP, not CDP.

404
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:09,160
Make sure to watch until the end of the quiz
for a bonus question from Boson Software’s

405
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:15,300
ExSim for CCNA, the best practice exams for
the CCNA, and the practice exams I used to

406
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,530
prepare for my CCNA exam.

407
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,720
Okay, let’s move on to the quiz.

408
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,950
Here’s question 1.

409
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,760
Which of the following commands show the configured
CDP timers?

410
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,820
Select two.

411
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,790
A, SHOW CDP.

412
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,440
B, SHOW CDP TRAFFIC.

413
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,580
C, SHOW CDP INTERFACE.

414
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,830
Or D, SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS.

415
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:43,750
Pause the video to think about your answers,
select two.

416
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:50,240
The answers are A and C. Both of these commands
show the configured CDP message time and holdtime.

417
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,880
D, SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS does show the current
holdtime counting down as the device waits

418
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:01,680
for a CDP message from its neighbor, but it
doesn’t show the actual configured holdtime.

419
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,290
It also doesn’t display the CDP message
timer, so it’s not one of the best answers.

420
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:10,720
Okay, let’s go to question 2.

421
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,570
Which of the following commands represent
the default CDP state?

422
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,570
Select two.

423
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,720
A, NO CDP RUN.

424
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,290
B, CDP HOLDTIME 120.

425
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:24,090
C, CDP ENABLE, from interface config mode.

426
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,040
Or D, CDP TIMER 60.

427
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:32,870
Pause the video to think about your answers,
select two.

428
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:39,290
The answers are C and D. CDP ENABLE enables
CDP on an interface, which is the default

429
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,430
state.

430
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:44,760
D sets the CDP message timer to 60 seconds,
which is the default.

431
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,910
A, NO CDP RUN, disables CDP on the router,
and that is not the default state, CDP is

432
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,429
enabled by default.

433
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:58,990
B, CDP HOLDTIME 120 sets the hold time to
120 seconds, which is not the default.

434
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,840
The default CDP holdtime is 180 seconds.

435
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,050
So, A and B are incorrect.

436
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:08,170
Let’s go to question 3.

437
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:12,450
You issue the show lldp entry SW1 command
on R1.

438
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:16,660
R1’s neighbor SW1 is a multilayer switch.

439
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,620
What do you expect to see in the ‘system
capabilities’ field of the output?

440
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,370
Here are the options.

441
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:27,430
Pause the video to think about your answer.

442
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:33,810
The answer is B, System Capabilities: B,R.
B is for bridge, which is another word for

443
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:34,870
switch.

444
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,790
R is for router.

445
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:40,820
Because SW1 is a multilayer switch, it has
the functionalities of both a switch and a

446
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,820
router.

447
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:48,799
S, as shown in options C and D, means switch
in CDP, but it does not mean switch in LLDP.

448
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,720
Okay, let’s go to question 4.

449
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,830
Which of the following statements about LLDP
are true?

450
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,980
Select two.

451
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,410
Here are the options.

452
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:04,890
Pause the video now, read each option, and
select the two correct choices.

453
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:13,870
Okay, the correct answers are B and F. When
configuring LLDP, unlike CDP, you must enable

454
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:18,610
TRANSMIT, Tx, and RECEIVE, Rx, separately
on each interface.

455
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:21,550
So, B is correct.

456
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:27,630
And LLDP can be used to learn the OS version
of a neighboring device, so F is also correct.

457
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,179
The other options are incorrect statements
about LLDP.

458
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:36,160
LLDP is an industry standard protocol, so
A is incorrect.

459
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,370
Its default message timer is 30 seconds, so
C is incorrect.

460
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:45,260
It can’t be used to learn the OSPF settings
of a neighbor, so D is incorrect.

461
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,760
And it can’t be used to learn the VTP settings
of a neighbor, although CDP can be used to

462
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,980
do that, so E is incorrect.

463
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,960
Okay, let’s go to question 5.

464
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,980
Which interface on R2 is SW2 connected to?

465
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,970
Is it G0/0, G0/1, G0/2, or G0/3?

466
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:13,679
Pause the video to examine R2’s CDP neighbor
table and select the correct answer.

467
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,570
The correct answer is G0/1.

468
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:20,250
It is shown here, in the local interface column
of the output.

469
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,780
This shows the interface on R2 that SW2 is
connected to.

470
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,429
Okay, that’s all for the quiz.

471
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:31,620
Now let’s try a bonus question from Boson
Software’s ExSim for CCNA.

472
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:37,430
Okay here's today's Boson ExSim practice question.

473
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:40,700
You issue the following command on your router.

474
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,700
SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS.

475
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,270
Which of the following information will be
displayed?

476
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,220
Select 4 choices.

477
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,500
A, the IP address of the neighboring device.

478
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,230
B, the interface on the neighboring device
that is connected to RouterA.

479
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:59,230
C, The device ID of the neighboring device.

480
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,400
D, the software version running on the neighboring
device.

481
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:08,700
E, the interface on RouterA that is connected
to the neighboring device.

482
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:13,600
Or F, the capabilities and product number
of the neighboring device.

483
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,200
Okay, pause the video now to think about your
answer.

484
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,980
Select 4 choices.

485
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:23,630
Okay, let's check.

486
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:27,940
Let's go through one by one and see which
answers are correct.

487
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:31,760
So A, the IP address of the neighboring device.

488
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,850
I think that is not displayed by SHOW CDP
NEIGHBORS.

489
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:40,780
To view that you have to use SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS
DETAIL, so A is not correct.

490
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:45,890
B, the interface on the neighboring device
that is connected to RouterA.

491
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,660
That is correct.

492
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,890
You can see that with SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS.

493
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:53,760
C, the device ID of the neighboring device.

494
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,970
You can also see that, that is the host name
of the neighboring device.

495
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:03,280
D, the software version running on the neighboring
device.

496
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,780
I think you cannot see that in SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS.

497
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,580
Once again, you have to use SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS
DETAIL to view the software version, the operating

498
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,330
system version of the neighboring device.

499
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:19,830
Okay, E, the interface on RouterA that is
connected to the neighboring device.

500
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:23,600
You can see that with SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS.

501
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,600
And how about F?

502
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:30,670
The capabilities, which is like router, switch,
etc, and product number, this is the model

503
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:35,290
of the device, of the neighboring device.

504
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,700
And yes you can.

505
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,230
So I think these are the four choices.

506
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:44,130
You cannot see the IP address of the neighboring
device or the software version of the neighboring

507
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,130
device.

508
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:48,650
To view those two you have to use SHOW CDP
NEIGHBORS DETAIL.

509
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:54,630
Okay, so to check my answer I will click down
here, show answer.

510
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,210
And that is correct.

511
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:58,760
So, here is Boson's explanation.

512
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,260
I'll scroll through it.

513
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:07,280
You can pause the video to read their explanation,
and I really recommend you do.

514
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,040
Boson gives great explanations, not just why
each correct answer is correct, but also why

515
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,350
each incorrect answer is incorrect.

516
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,451
So they are a great resource to improve your
understanding.

517
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:25,790
Okay, and at the bottom there are a few references
to the official cert guide by Wendell Odom.

518
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:29,050
This is a great book for studying for the
CCNA.

519
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:34,710
And also some Cisco documentation about CDP
which is free to read online.

520
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:41,410
Okay, so that's Boson ExSim for the CCNA.

521
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:45,440
If you want to get ExSim, please follow the
link in the video description.

522
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,130

the CCNA.

523
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:54,390
Once again, follow that link in the video
description.

524
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:57,340

video.

525
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,760
There is a flashcard deck to use with the
software ‘Anki’.

526
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,090
There will also be a packet tracer practice
lab so you can get some hands-on practice.

527
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:07,650
That will be in the next video.
