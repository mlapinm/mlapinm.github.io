description 15.230562 this lab is the second of
our labs focusing on NAT network
address translation 22.000687 this time we will
configure dynamic NAT 25.843791 unlike static map
which creates a one-to-one translation
from an inside address to an outside
address dynamic NAT dynamically assigns
addresses as needed from a pool of
outside addresses that you configure
beforehand 40.374499 this is much more efficient
than static NAT 43.929894 in this lab we will use
dynamic map to translate private IP
addresses in the 192.168.1.0 / 24
network to public IP addresses in the
1.2.3.0 / 24 network 58.471664 this lab uses the
same topology as the previous lab 63.403039 and
once again
rip has been pre-configured so that all
points in the network should be
reachable 68.390663 once again however I have
configured ACLs on the routers blocking
private addresses from being routed over
the serial connection between them which
simulates the Internet 78.623454 let's ping from
pc-1 to server one just to confirm that PC
one cannot reach server one 84.688702 ping 
1.1.1.100
as expected the pink fails
99.057514 so let's configure dynamic NAT on r
1 103.381723 first I'll configure that inside and
outside interfaces 108.052827 enable conf t
interface g00 115.972556 IP NAT inside interface s
0 3 0 122.254764 IP NAT outside exit 124.897868 dynamic NAT
involves a few extra steps beyond static
NAT 129.782305 we have to create an ACL which we
use to identify the inside addresses
that we will translate 135.702096 we also have to
create an app pool 138.728846 which is the range of
outside addresses we will translate our
inside addresses to 143.390450 first let's create
the access list 146.326845 keep in mind this use of
an ACL is different than how we
previously used it 151.911282 before we used ACLs
to block or allow traffic from entering
or exiting an interface 158.126449 this time
however we will use an ACL to identify
which traffic we want to translate
164.323094 traffic which is permitted by the ACL
will be translated 169.132385 traffic which is
denied by the ACL won't be blocked it
simply won't be translated 175.042739 so let's
create a standard ACL which permits the
192.168.1.0 / 24 network 182.705468 access list 1
permit 192.168.1.0
0.0.0.255 191.867884 that's it 194.276488 the implicit deny
any at the end of the ACL will prevent
traffic from outside of the 192.168.1.0
/ 24 network from being translated 203.976613 next
let's create the NAT pool 207.783654 to do so use
this command 210.436487 IP NAT pool followed by the
pool name 214.858278 I'll use pool 1 216.727528 then we enter
the first address in the range of
addresses we want to include in this
pool 222.754965 which is 1.2.3.10 according to our
instructions

227.266381 next we put the last address in the
range 1.2.3.20 next we type netmask
followed by the subnet mask 237.022359 which is
255.255.255.0
so our command is IP nat pool 243.713838 pool 1 1.2.3.10 1.2.3.20 net mask 255.255.255.0 253.508941 ok
our pool is now configured 256.577670 finally let's
configure NAT itself 259.970565 the command starts
the same as with static NAT IP NAT
inside source
now with static NAT we use IP NAT inside
source static 270.673814 however for dynamic NAT we
will use IP net inside source list
followed by the name or number of our
ACL which is 1 279.889772 then pool followed by the
pool name which is pool 1 283.536647 so our command
is IP net inside source list 1 pool pool
1 291.653291 our dynamic map configuration is now
complete
295.238145 I'll go on each PC and quickly ping
server 1 298.824999 then go on r1 to check the
translations on PC 1 first 304.513852 ping 1.1.1.100
310.423727 okay next I'll go on PC 2 and ping
server one ping 1.1 1.1 hundred 322.760872 okay and
next I'll go on PC 3 ping 1.1.1.100 334.519142 okay now let's go on r1 to check
these translations 341.743746 exit to check the net
translations use this command 349.006058 show IP
nat translations 351.338433 notice at the top the
terms inside global inside local outside
local outside global 360.896849 we want to focus on
inside global and inside local 364.971287 inside
global is the Abbas's we translate it to
in the 1.2.3.0 / 24 subnet 372.789932 and inside
local is the original private IP address
range 377.533661 in the 192.168.1.0 / 24 subnet
381.920077 note that the number after the colon in
these IP addresses indicates a port
number 387.617535 here is 192.168.1.11 pc 1 392.570847 and
address it was translated to 395.911263 here is
192.168.1.11 pc 2 401.133200 and the address it
was translated to 403.171384 and here is
192.168.1.13
pc 3 and the address it was translated
to  410.464945 if you want to clear all of these
dynamic translations use this command
416.283174 clear IP neck translation followed by an
asterisk
421.876757 okay now let's do that show command one
more time 425.438215 show IP NAT translations 427.910819 there
we go our translations are cleared
432.364673 we have successfully configured dynamic
NAT 434.814048 that's all for this lab 436.609027 thank you
