==================== 

 
[Music] 
7.940219  
hello there my name is Ken Mayer I'm 
going to be your instructor for this 
course  
12.018005 
I want to talk a little bit about 
my history and experience with a lot of 
different routing and switching 
companies  
16.418201 
has really kind of been over 
two decades  
19.57855 
plus you know before this 
whole world of Cisco came along I was 
doing some other things in the high tech 
industry  
26.295136 
but I've had the opportunity to 
watch and grow with companies like Cisco 
30.11834 
other companies competitors that I won't 
mention here as well  
32.808515 
which has caused me 
to be able to have this skill that I 
need to be able to work with  
37.684968 
either an 
enterprise whether it's small medium or 
large  
41.752311 
and also in the last row probably 
10 years I've had the opportunity to 
work with a lot of Internet service 
providers  
48.050208 
cellular phone providers and 
to be able to fortunately travel around 
the world  
52.471159 
to be able to facilitate not 
only training  
54.696583 
but also while in the 
world of consulting  
57.558944 
so when it comes to 
Cisco of course I work with routing and 
switching  
61.50723 
I do work with security  
62.628452 
voice 
over IP service provider routing as well 
67.002591 
and probably some other things that I 
can't even remember  
70.20633 
and I do many of 
those things with other organizations 
73.058512 
now one of the things that's really 
great is that a lot of the different 
types of protocols  
78.163192 
that we're going to 
talk about are a lot of open standards 
which means that once you understand 
those quite thoroughly  
85.320695 
you can work with 
almost any provider  
88.081162 
it's just a matter 
of learning the command line  
89.837204 
so let's 
hope that I can do both of that for you 
during this course is that you'll be 
familiar comfortable with the command 
lines  
95.758688 
and they'll you have a good 
understanding of the protocols  
98.608362 
and the 
processes so you understand what it is 
that you're looking for  
102.501595 
and that's kind 
of my goals to make sure that you are 
going to be better at not only working 
with Cisco's equipment  
109.120127 
but again having 
a better understanding of why we 
implement some of the different types of 
configurations that we do  
115.834165 
now in this 
module we're going to talk about network 
design 
119.811045
and what we're gonna do is we're 
going to kind of look at the theory some 
hierarchical models 
123.700087
some ideas that help 
you not just you know put a bunch of 
switches into the closet 
wire everything together and call it 
good 
130.844139
we want to talk about the reasons 
why we make different choices 
133.564705
and how those choices can help you in 
improving network communications to be 
able to help you with the scalability or 
future growth 
141.752924
and we're going to take a 
look at some of the operations that 
switches go through in how they can 
forward packets or frames based on 
whether or not we're going to be using 
IP addresses to make decisions 
152.774984
or where 
they're going to be using MAC addresses 
154.719921 
so yes our conversation is going to be 
centric to Ethernet networks 
158.937006
we're not 
going to talk about any other type of 
layer 2 encapsulation model 
163.042664
so that's 
our focus and that's what we're going to 
discuss and show you 
166.385208
give you some 
demonstrations about some of the command 
lines 
169.985114
that we use to be able to if 
anything just verify that switching is 
working the way we intended it to 
174.796973
so 
we're going to introduce and discuss 
this whole thing called the cisco 
hierarchical model 
181.974835
it's a model that's 
been around for a while although over 
time it has you know changed a bit to 
address other issues some of which like 
security but I'll talk about that 
191.636217
but 
when we look at the hierarchical model 
194.160895
what we're gonna do is we're gonna 
discuss the problems that we have with 
what we call a flat network 
198.850694
now a flat 
network just simply means that all of 
your endpoints the printers your 
wireless access points your laptops your 
B y ou D to bring your own devices 
computers desktop servers 
212.395025
they're all on 
the same subnet basically 
215.427039
what we would 
normally call the same broadcast domain 
218.009411
and the problem that we have is that you 
mean you can certainly add more to it 
222.555947
but as you add more and more devices 
into this flat network that you'll see 
226.498307
that you really don't have the 
scalability you want 
229.573298
because of this 
thing called a broadcast storm 
231.292226
and I'll 
try to diagram that make sure we all 
understand that 
234.617182
and then that's where 
we're going to move to the Cisco 
hierarchical network 
237.471068
well we'll talk about things like the 
access layer the distribution layer and 
the core layer 
243.363127
so you have a good 
understanding about the benefits that we 
have even if you don't think future 
growth is in the future 
250.411525
but does that 
sound us um what we've done it anyway 
let's hope that it is for your company 
for your organization we always want to 
be able to think about growth 
257.843342
but we 
also want to think about application 
support 
260.487761
if you decide one day to start 
to converge your traffic 
264.322092
and move from 
just data to voice over IP 
or maybe the video 
268.426486
you know we're gonna 
see some big problems when it comes to a 
flat network 
272.27465
and we're gonna see how we 
can address those with the Cisco 
hierarchical network 
276.872286
so I'm gonna build 
a flat network first 
280.622418
and whenever you 
see me put these little squares in 
because I'm not going to take the time 
to put the little arrows in between each 
one 
286.367668
that's going to be representing a 
switch 
288.865211
in this case a layer two switch by 
layer two I mean it's going to make all 
of its forwarding decisions based on an 
Ethernet MAC address 
297.917324
the thing we call 
that burnin address and let me make some 
connections between these make sure we 
have some redundancy so we can cause 
loops without spanning tree 
306.456019
and you can 
imagine with all of these switches 
310.039081
whether you want to think that I'm 
drawing multiple floors 
312.467808
or you know just 
where they are in the rack whatever 
315.817947
the 
case here is is 
that each one of these 
318.703426
I 
mean at the low end right we have 
switches that are going to be 24 ports 
maybe 48 ports 
324.464315
and again I'm talking 
about the low end of the product line 
326.891627
and if you think about all these 
endpoints that are connected to 
330.304247
it they 
are at least not sharing the bandwidth 
these aren't hubs 
334.434427
so they all get their 
own you know gigabit ethernet speed 
338.736601
maybe it's 10 gigs between the switches 
you know we're trying to accommodate for 
aggregation 
344.454294
but once any one of these 
computers connected here sends a 
broadcast 
348.605183
that broadcast by rule is 
going to be flooded to every switch in 
the network 
354.872273
which means all these up 
links that you have are going to be 
basically used up on their bandwidth 
from each of the broadcast traffic that 
is sent 
365.159302
and and you start multiplying 
that number of broadcasts being flooded 
amongst all of the different computers 
and all of the different computers or 
endpoints that are going to start or 
initiate these broadcasts 
376.685143
what we end up 
with here is having what we call a 
broadcast storm 
380.323388
now a broadcast storm 
just simply means that once a broadcast 
is sent everybody within this area is 
going to be hearing that broadcast 
388.437257
whether it was meant for them or not 
390.549739
and 
so not only is it using these what we 
would call trunk links between the 
switches 
396.117725
but it's also going to be 
eating up connectivity and 
mutations for all the other end points 
402.971153
now technically it's not just broadcast 
traffic 
406.982065
that is going to be sent all 
over the place 
409.316275
we have to flood what's 
called bum traffic 
411.936459
where the B stands 
for broadcast traffic the one I just 
mentioned 
416.33104
but there's another type of 
traffic that switches half to flood 
419.51063
it's 
called the unknown unicast
421.32457 
that's when 
the destination MAC address doesn't 
exist in the switches kam table 
427.950574
so it 
has to send a flood out to try to help 
find that destination machine 
432.774751
and then 
of course there's multicast 
435.05802
so that's 
the B um I just like calling it bum 
traffic it sounds fun 
438.695769
all right 
so maybe in your network design and this 
by the way 
442.778375
it would be the example of a 
flat network design 
446.201741
because we're all in 
the same broadcast domain 
449.111501
so when we 
look at this 
450.687116
you might say well right 
now it's controllable 
452.820564
maybe the you know 
you've decided through your own network 
analysis that this bum traffic isn't 
causing you that much of a problem 
460.508899
but 
then I have to ask the question 
462.309874
what 
happens if you need to expand your 
network 
465.809366
that you need to expand and add 
more ports for the computers the 
endpoints to connect in to 
471.453983
what's going 
to happen when we add that other switch 
474.746531
how much more broadcast traffic are we 
going to require 
477.282403
in other words it's 
very difficult to grow your network when 
you have a flat network 
483.242152
so then comes 
the hierarchical design 
486.404892
and in the 
hierarchical design I had mentioned 
three layers 
489.769852
I'm going to talk about 
each one a little bit more detail as we 
go 
492.233068
but one of the ideas was 
493.980983
and this is 
how we originally looked at things is 
496.268244
that you know when we had this flood or 
this broadcast storm 
501.003597
coming in one of 
the implementations we started using was 
some sort of layer 3 device 
508.474662
so if I 
could replace this thing at the top 
510.527983
well 
let's say a router 
511.650935
a router would create 
different broadcast domains 
515.291144
in other 
words routers were not allowed to 
propagate a broadcast from one segment 
to another 
520.894746
everything going through the 
router with the exception of multicast 
of course had to be a unicast address 
527.94682
so 
that we could control that propagation 
but then we would have 
to redesign these 
connections that we have 
533.700863
you know 
take away this little connection here 
537.273343
you know so that we're not circumventing 
the router by any means 
540.498324
we also used 
VLANs to help control broadcast traffic 
545.104252
but if you think about it 
546.55462
VLAN where I might choose let me again 
or get rid of some of these other little 
lines 
550.86971
let's connect these too 
552.788939
when we 
had VLANs 
554.333152
it was pretty much the same 
555.608189
as 
having a router what I mean by that is 
that we might have created a smaller 
broadcast domain 
561.054021
and maybe it was 
another VLAN here for another broadcast 
domain 
565.416248
but we still had to have a layer 
3 device to be able to get from one VLAN 
to the other 
570.279522
in other words 
it was no 
longer flat 
572.270917
once you started 
implementing those types of solutions 
574.923946
and and those solutions are very 
important because it also facilitated 
the eventual growth of your network 
582.497981
so 
when we start looking than at the 
hierarchical model 
587.210785
and like I said I'll 
talk a little bit more about this 
589.669446
we're 
going to talk about having what we call 
the access layer 
594.354239
and at the access layer 
depending on how you put it together not 
all the switches are connected to each 
other in the access layer 
601.836507
but the access 
layer gets its name 
604.34482 
because 
that is the 
first point of access for most endpoint 
devices 
609.7681
so that means that in this 
access layer that I'll put down here 
613.525016
that I can have my printers my laptops 
my smart phones or other smart devices 
622.08744
all making their first point of entry 
into this network 
626.550366
let's see how good my 
vizio of a printer is there 
629.49299
and and so 
if the traffic was local 
632.599793
all things were 
good 
634.979833
they could talk to each other off 
those local switches 
638.351432
that they are all 
connected to 
639.724383
but the idea was whether I 
use VLANs or not was to limit that 
broadcast traffic 
646.158493
I didn't want the 
broadcast traffic to still the flood 
649.474499
and 
so often what we would do is we would 
move 
651.184553
and we often call these a 
distribution switch 
654.452239
some people might 
call them a multi-layer switch 
657.742654
multi-layer right that means that they 
can make forwarding decisions that layer 
two MAC addresses 
662.670422
and they can make 
decisions on forwarding at layer 3 with 
IP addresses 
667.730359
creating what we call an ether channel 
670.158156
which is later on in our course between 
those 
673.489562
and so we would send our traffic 
up here instead of trying to connect him 
down at the bottom 
679.588723
whether we use VLANs 
or not that you know as another design 
issue 
683.810064
but the idea here now is that to 
get from let's say one part of the 
access layer to another part of the 
access layer 
691.443305
we would go through the 
distribution layer 
693.992924
and then be able to 
avoid having those large broadcast 
domains 
700.816679
and it would be easier to start 
adding new switches for the access layer 
704.875807
because all I would have to do by adding 
a new switch is just make sure that it 
can get to the distribution layer 
710.83574
when 
we still use VLANs 
712.549869
absolutely 
VLANs not only created broadcast domains 
716.088994
but they also helped us with a lot of 
security types of problems 
721.022543
now in some 
cases in our distribution layer 
725.386613
especially if we had long distances or 
different buildings in our campus 
730.307741
and we 
might not connect these distribution 
layers together 
733.351991
we would also have this 
other layer called the core layer 
736.693516
the 
core layer would have of course a higher 
performing multi-layer switch 
741.696647
it could 
use a router but I'll give you that 
example here in just a second 
746.022147
but the 
idea now is that the core layer was 
designed to move traffic at a very high 
speed 
751.701464
why would I use another 
multi-layer switch a more powerful one 
than a router 
757.474739
it just kind of depends 
because outside of the core layer 
760.641009
if I 
have to leave to go into the let's say 
the world of the internet 
764.55874
then and in 
doing so I'm going through a service 
provider 
770.338848
if I'm not leaving through what 
we call Metro Ethernet 
773.964729
and maybe taking 
some other ran type of technology 
777.325722
a 
router does good at translating from 
Ethernet to that other layer to 
encapsulation 
782.289911
to get you out to the 
world wide web 
783.857794
and so that's where I 
might generally see a router 
785.944792
because 
we're actually translating from Ethernet 
to some other type of interface or 
communications 
792.821837
so those are the three 
layers of the hierarchical design 
797.574889
and as 
I said I'll talk about each one a little 
more detail as we go into 
all of those 
803.486266
but I hope what you're 
seeing here is the ability for your 
network to grow 
807.094846
and to be able to what 
we call scaling out Without Really 
flooding the whole world with that bum 
traffic 
813.852883
we want to be able to control it 
give us better service 
817.864976
and you know 
there's just so many other really cool 
things we can do here it's very 
important for us 
822.57585
but that is what they 
call a hierarchical design 
824.814483
all right so 
let's talk about each of those in a 
little bit more detail 
828.959045
so let's look at 
that access layer 
828.959045
that access layer as I 
said 
834.420777
we're generally talking about 
switches 
836.660952
but that's not the only way 
into the access layer to have a switch 
840.242631
you might also have a wireless access 
point 
844.33023
those by the way our antennas on 
the side 
845.780931
and that access point generally 
is going to a switch in the access layer 
851.195864
all right so let's talk about that 
852.632884
access layer as I said it's the entry 
point of any endpoint device 
857.193449
by endpoint 
what I mean is that the traffic going to 
that device is not going to be relayed 
862.882769
I'm a switch that's a transit type of 
device 
866.190618
traffic coming in we're expecting 
it to be forwarded to some other 
location 
870.060716
eventually to get to another 
endpoint 
872.501439
so that's what I mean by the 
endpoints 
874.117344
so we could again like I said 
we could have computers hooked up we'll 
get our printers hooked up you know in 
today's day and age we might have 
telephones right the voice over IP 
phones hooked into our access layer 
886.383462
let's let's put a wireless person over 
here right 
888.560866
making that connection 
to the access point 
890.732971
so what we see at 
this access layer 
894.598479
and remember that's 
going off eventually into the 
distribution layer 
898.145209
what we see here is 
that we might have a convergence of 
different types of traffic 
902.984478
as I just got 
through saying 
904.156275
I get a voice over IP 
voice traffic 
906.051129
regular data traffic maybe 
some sort of video 
910.742977
if that hopefully 
looks like a camera on a tripod 
913.543808
it could 
be a video voice over IP phone 
915.625002
but it's 
a variety of different types of traffic 
918.279546
so that's where we start seeing the 
convergence 
920.721827
now from the time that Cisco 
first started talking about this 
hierarchical model 
926.964069
they didn't mention 
this as another option which is 
introducing security at this layer 
933.322644
it 
used to be it was just the distribution 
layer 
935.669605
where we talked about security 
937.774311
but as we 
know in today's world we need to have 
security 
941.09434
you know at every layer we can 
943.462304
we talk about when hackers are trying to 
break into the network 
947.600647
and remember I'm 
talking about the OSI model 
949.651785
when I talk 
about layers 
951.592022
so at layer 2 that was the 
data link layer 
954.836907
and that is a type of 
encapsulation 
958.877498
a way of encoding your 
data into the way it's going to be 
transmitted as a bunch of ones and zeros 
964.484958
and then above that was the IP at layer 
3 called the network layer 
969.206472
and yes I 
know if you're in a this switch course 
973.179371
you're more than familiar with all of 
these layers 
976.441023
but the reason I'm taking 
the time to talk about it here 
979.193922
is that 
in the earlier days 
981.48083
we didn't really see 
security introduced at this layer 
984.37209
and 
the idea was is that a hacker could 
break in and take your network over at 
layer 2 
989.370773
that means they generally owned 
all of the layers that were above it 
993.105741
and 
so you know when it comes to security 
this becomes a new place to introduce 
that security 
999.270451
so I got to be careful I 
don't turn this into a security class 
1002.399032
anyway one of the very common types of 
security that we're seeing now 
1006.891523
is this 
port based authentication 802 dot 1x 
1010.311533
now 
remember this is an I Triple E 
specification 
1013.921686
and everything that starts 
with 802 dot 1 is really the category 
for switching 
1020.953324
I don't want you to 
confuse this with 802 11 
1023.834768
which is all 
about this wireless access point here 
1027.144796
but we can use a tor 2.1 x there 
1030.383882
as well 
anyway port based security just meant 
that if somebody walked into your office 
1037.782293
and decided to plug their laptop into 
your network 
1040.617613
that and hoping that your 
dhcp server 
1042.786135
would give them the IP 
address and Gateway information 
1046.672315
that 
they could start moving through your 
network 
1048.806407
and 802 double NX basically says 
no 
1052.045122
you have to authenticate 
1053.048351
you have to 
be able to provide me with a username 
password combination you or the machine 
that you plugged in either one of them 
1060.252681
has to be able to authenticate 
1062.051251
and prove 
that you have the access privileges to 
get there 
1065.994466
and in some cases we can even 
now create secure 
with what we call the VLAN access 
control list 
1073.038528
and that's pretty cool 
because we can control traffic per VLAN 
if we wanted to 
1078.346811
and later on you're 
gonna hear us talk about private VLANs 
which can add another layer of security 
1084.585516
but so that's kind of like I said new 
within 
1087.679814
well I say new because I've been 
working with Cisco pretty much since the 
company was founded in some way or 
another 
1094.005142
and that was never a discussion 
that we would had before 
1097.498447
and also be at 
the access layer obviously we support 
multicast 
1102.680959
I mean if you think about it 
if I'm gonna send out a video stream 
1105.235408
that video stream is starting at the 
access layer 
1109.133824
and with multicast very 
important that we don't treat it like a 
broadcast 
1113.991712
you know there's only a few 
computers that are in the access layer 
1117.978937
that want the multicast stream 
1119.564807
it'd be 
nice if our switches can also help make 
sure that that's the case 
1123.414331
so that's what 
multicast is all about 
1126.28501
so coming from 
the access layer 
1130.340532
that I just described 
is all of this traffic from multiple 
switches 
1135.754604
and as I said we probably would 
be using what we call a multi-layer 
switch 
1142.008289
okay so a multi-layer switch by 
its design is actually much faster than 
a lot of your routers 
1148.054865
and remember I 
said the purpose I might choose routers 
for is to do some layer 2 translation 
going from Ethernet to whatever else you 
might be using in the old days 
technology like hdl-c PPP 
1162.200718
oh hopefully 
never frame relay again 
1164.730383
but anyway it 
acts as a traffic aggregation 
1168.633823
we do kind 
of hope that at the access layer 
1171.057607
we can 
keep as much traffic local 
1173.550777
as we can but 
you see there was this old you know in 
the old days 
1178.925371
we had what were they 
called the 80/20 rule at the access 
layer 
1182.12557
that 80% of the traffic stayed 
local 
1184.852495
and 20% had to be routed or 
forwarded to some of the location 
1189.985081
but 
with today's cloud services private or 
public cloud with the advent of server 
farms with going to the internet 
1199.58771
that's 
changed now most everything is the 20/80 
rule 
which is 20% of your traffic stays local 
80% is going out maybe even more 
1209.236013
so 
that's why we say the first thing that 
they have 
1211.347593
there is traffic aggregation 
because what we have is a lot of streams 
of data coming in to a central point 
1218.034345
you 
know maybe we have other distribution 
components 
1221.501168
which would be great so they 
can connect to other access layers 
1225.060424
and 
that's where we'll eventually get to the 
core layer 
1227.767232
and so our decisions here are 
usually what we called routing 
1233.351413
the 
reason I called it forwarding is when we 
get into kind of the model 
1237.443383
and how it's 
all put together 
1238.725376
you get kind of a 
better picture of why I like the idea of 
layer 3 forwarding 
1243.015355
routings is simply 
meant looking at the IP address 
1246.239791
assuming 
that you're using an IP network 
1248.981506
and then 
making a routing decision about the 
outbound interface 
1252.786188
but all this traffic 
is coming in being aggregated from all 
these other parts of your access layer 
1258.839618
so here in the distribution layer I'm 
just going to type D is T so I don't 
have to spell the whole word 
1264.756774
is where we 
aggregate it we make the routing 
decisions 
1269.014171
and the idea is is that you 
know our traffic can come in 
1272.434349
one 
interface from one part of the access 
layer 
1275.585204
after we look at the IP address 
1277.687667
then it can go out to whatever the 
destination part of that traffic is 
what's local and that part of the access 
layer 
1284.729831
another part of our design is 
redundancy 
1288.167922
because if I did connect it 
the way you see here 
1290.290835
we could have a 
problem with one of those multi-layer 
switches going down 
1297.175696
and from now on I'm 
going to try to call it a distribution 
switch 
1299.920897
instead of a multi-layer switch 
1301.983704
so what we might see then is in our 
design at the access layer 
1306.623425
is having 
perhaps redundant connections 
1309.659437
as you see 
here 
1310.553132
so I always have a different method 
or way to get out 
1314.276862
or as we move on to 
some other topics later in our course 
we'll talk about some of these things I 
call the first hop redundancy protocol 
1321.919585
which is another set of protocols when 
we get to that try to get rid of that 
single point of failure 
1328.020876
in any event 
what we're trying to do here is have the 
redundancy in the design 
1333.218692
so that as I 
said we don't lose 
1335.386153
you know big chunks 
of our 
network 
1337.556792
but where I told you what was 
new with the access layer where we 
started at adding in the some idea of 
security 
1344.70554
this is where security we used 
to tell people was the first place that 
security was introduced 
1349.738713
in fact it was 
about the only place that we try to 
introduce security 
1352.195829
and that's because at 
layer 3 we could create an access 
control list 
1356.058609
and to be able to utilize 
that access control list as a packet 
filter firewall 
1360.709347
for that matter we might 
have even had firewalls in there that 
were stateful and did a little bit more 
for us 
1367.678939
but it was still a way of 
controlling the traffic 
1370.330618
to make sure 
maybe the traffic from our end users 
might not have access to the part of 
maybe human resources networks 
1380.514761
and so we 
could control that through the 
distribution layer 
1383.765999
of course I also told 
you we're adding phones 
1386.312881
and by the way 
if you don't recognize this symbol 
1389.207984
there 
was a day that phones had this little 
handset you picked up 
1392.402127
and a little dial 
so you could dial the numbers 
1395.195571
and that's 
about the best phone I know how to draw 
1397.445371
so that's what those little things are 
the little curve is the handset 
1400.876142
but one 
of the things we have a problem with is 
I said hey 
1403.418549
we do traffic aggregation 
1406.236914
that means there might be a competition 
for the services of the distribution 
layer to forward packets 
1411.491634
because it's 
dealing with a lot of packets 
1414.145124
and so we 
also introduced QoS quality of service 
1418.157235
so we could give preference to traffic 
whose really if it had latency 
1423.642588
latency 
meaning it takes a while for the packets 
to move it could really damage that 
service in a phone call 
1429.187138
we just hate 
having things sound like they're 
breaking up 
1432.311337
we don't like to miss 
packets or drop packets 
1435.008774
we don't want to 
make it sound like somebody's talking 
through a blender 
1439.176614
so we also introduced 
QoS and there as well 
1443.501691
and of course we 
could also filter other types of 
services 
1447.101326
you know from a lot of the 
needs of you know somebody else trying 
to do a service that probably isn't part 
of what we asked for 
1455.930187
so and that 
filtering I'd probably put more with the 
firewalls 
1460.209234
there at the distribution 
layer 
1462.898121
but that's what we're looking at 
then of course depending on your design 
1465.703467
as I said if what I just drew let's say 
was building a on your 
campus 
1471.715648
and I need to get to building B 
1474.077155
then I would probably go through as I 
said the core layer 
1477.359916
and the core layer 
as you're about to see is I got a 
different designation a different type 
of of what it's trying to accomplish for 
us 
1484.922936
so at the core layer and I know 
you're probably getting tired of seeing 
me write access overly spell it right 
distribution 
1494.557049
and as I just got through 
saying 
1497.034863
I might need to get from building 
a over here to building B 
1502.127781
I mean this is 
one example this 
1503.176236
could all be in the 
same building 
1504.293865
it's just I'm trying to 
conceptually give you an idea of what's 
happening here 
1508.207103
and so what happens is 
we'll send our traffic from one part of 
our network or campus building into the 
core 
1515.811082
and we'll still going to be using a 
multi-layer switch 
we'll call it a 
course switch 
1522.397784
and here all we're really 
worried about is high speed 
1526.553167
when I say 
high speed that generally means that 
were not involved in enforcing security 
policies at the core layer 
1534.465673
if you think 
about it when you start adding your 
devices to inspect every packet to make 
sure it's approved 
1541.18142
you're going to be 
slowing down that throughput of traffic 
security services does that 
1546.202057
and it 
should do that 
1547.64376
because it's you know 
very a lot more complex 
1550.011417
it's not just 
looking at a routing table 
1552.202932
and saying oh 
that's where it goes 
there's more to it 
takes a little more processing power so 
we want the core to be high-speed 
1558.430365
and if 
you think about it you had to pass a 
security check at the distribution layer 
to even be able to get your traffic up 
to the core layer 
1567.059244
and so it's built for 
high speed 
1570.432053
but again it could be an 
aggregation port for all of that traffic 
coming from the distribution or the 
different distribution layers 
1577.931403
and we 
also should have redundancy 
1580.348517
just like we 
did at the distribution layer to avoid a 
single point of failure 
1585.37161
now there's a 
lot of different things we can do to cut 
do what's called fast convergence 
1589.873715
fast 
convergence that simply means if one of 
my connections goes down 
1594.760083
and I still 
want to be able to afford my traffic 
1597.436244
I 
have to find the next best route to get 
there 
1600.431966
and and depending on some of the things 
we'll talk about when we get into the 
routing protocols 
1604.597241
we'll see what we can 
do 
1607.628133
to do that fast convergence that 
means 
1609.632503
I don't want to wait 40 seconds 
1611.802014
which might happen with some routing 
protocols 
1614.675375
for you to find the next best 
route 
1616.061162
because 40 seconds is gonna end a 
phone call 
1619.724349
it's going to break sessions 
1621.673811
it's just not good I want to get this 
1623.26744
if 
I could I'd love to get my convergence 
to less than one second 
1627.459527
if that's at all 
possible 
1628.850991
so at worst I might miss a 
packet or two 
1631.248656
and of course by adding a core layer I 
can move on to maybe a building see 
1637.386699
and 
have even that future growth 
availability 
1641.476204
so the core layer is all 
about speed 
1644.338275
and that's kind of our goal 
in this hierarchical model 
1647.680859
