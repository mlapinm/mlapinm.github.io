welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab 
5.832196
you can download the lab

file from the link in the description 
9.461726
in

this lab we will be working with two

routers r1 and r2 and two switches

switch 1 and switch 2 
18.220798
we will configure

and test a serial connection between the

two routers 
23.053658
note that I have already

configured the host names of each of the

devices beforehand 
28.479349
try to complete the

lab yourself first 
30.995791
then continue

watching this video if you have trouble
34.099378
or watch after to check your solution
37.066538
step one asks us to use CVP to discover

which interfaces are used to connect the

routers and switches 
45.431644
if you have the

option always show port labels and

logical workspace in the Preferences

menu of packet tracer enabled 
53.234291
the labels

will appear next to the devices 
55.786652
but I

have this option turned off 
57.795282
we will use

CDP or Cisco discovery protocol to

identify the interfaces 
65.096571
CDP is a very

useful tool 
68.209152
and I will create a lab

dedicated to using CDP in the future 
71.969467
but

for this lab all we need to know is one

command 
75.173503
that is show CDP neighbors 
78.333514
let's

give it a try on switch one first 
81.059055
I'll

type in able to enter privileged exec

mode 
85.571686
this is where we use the command
88.506662
show CDP neighbors 
90.417569
as you can see switch

1 is connected to r1 
95.005788
and the local

interface meaning the interface on this

device is fastethernet 0/1 
100.969255
let's go to

r1 
103.046601
enable show CDP neighbors 
107.714236
our one is

connected to switch 1 on the Fast

Ethernet 0 interface 
113.346247
but something's

missing 
115.672844
where's our - well because I

have linked lights enabled on packet

tracer 
120.699267
you might have noticed something

is wrong 
123.420657
let's troubleshoot a little bit
125.766684
think of potential causes first at layer

1 or the physical layer of the OSI model
132.031954
is the cable plugged in
134.467056
yes it is 
135.60099
as you can see here in packet

tracer 
137.451453
are the interfaces turned on
139.987576
let's check 
141.026169
I'll use the show IP

interface brief command to check 
146.669395
well we

were going to use CDP to discover which

interface r1 is connected to are two

through 
153.622681
but as we can see there is only

one serial interface 

serial zero 
159.08914
and

it's administrative lead down 
162.101767
that means

if we do a show run command 
164.56889
which I will

do now 
166.199811
we should see the shutdown

command on the serial interface
169.015846
I didn't configure this 171.716357
this is by

default 
172.605723
let's fix that 
174.007918
conf

no shutdown 
179.757747
let's check on our to also
182.39393
enable show IP interface brief 
186.24296
again it

is shutdown 
188.130114
conf T interface serial zero

no shutdown 
193.791351
okay
195.666509
now let's return to r1 
197.353092
this can take

some time but if I enter show CDP

neighbors again 
203.218257
I should see our two 
205.116741
there

it is

r1 is connected to our - through the

serial zero interface let's run the

command on our to type end to return to

privileged exec mode show CDP neighbors

- is also connected to r1 through the

serial zero interface and switch -

through the Fast Ethernet zero interface

finally let's move on to switch to

enable show CDP neighbors as you can see

switch 2 is connected to R 2 through the

Fast Ethernet 0-1 interface step 1 is

now complete

step2 asks us to identify which end of

the serial connection is DCE

and which end is DTE in serial

connections one side is DCE

or data communications equipment and one

side is DTE or data terminal equipment

the most important difference between

the two is that the DCE device supplies

the clock signal that paces the

communications which will adjust in the

next step to identify which is which

let's go to r1 first we'll use the

command show controllers serial zero if

we just type show controllers we would

be overwhelmed with information about

every interface on the router so make

sure to specify serial zero can you find

what we're looking for there it is and

this side is the DCE

you can also see the clock rate

mentioned earlier well now I know which

side is DC e that means R 2 should be

DTE but let's check anyway

let's hop onto our to show controllers

serial zero as expected R 2 is DTE step

two is now complete

for step three we have to set the clock

rate on the DCE end to 64 kilobits per

second so let's go back to our one we

have to configure the serial zero

interface so compte then interface

serial zero now we are in interface

configuration mode the clock rate is set

with the clock rate command let's use

the question mark to see what options we

have as you can see here these options

are listed in bits per second our task

is to set the speed to 64 kilobits per

second which is 64,000 bits per second

so let's do that that's all for step

three we don't have to do anything on

the DTE side step four tells us to set

the IP addresses of the serial

interfaces of r1 and r2 to 192.168.1 /

24 and 192.168 to

interface configuration mode on r1 so

let's configure r1 IP address

192.168.1.1 at him this is something you

should know if not don't worry about it

it's 255.255.255.0 there we go now let's

do the same on r2 conf t interface

serial zero IP address 192.168.0.0

that's all for step four

finally Step five asks us to test

connectivity between the routers since

we're already on our - let's do it from

here type end to return to privileged

exec mode the IP address of our one

serial zero interface is 192.168.0.1 so

ping 192.168.0.1 as you can see we have

connectivity between the routers that's
