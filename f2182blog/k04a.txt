in this lab we will be working with two routers r1 and r2 and two switches switch 1 and switch 2
18.220798
we will configure and test a serial connection between the two routers
23.053658
note that I have already configured the host names of each of the devices beforehand
28.479349
try to complete the lab yourself first
30.995791
then continue watching this video if you have trouble
34.099378
or watch after to check your solution
37.066538
step one asks us to use CVP to discover which interfaces are used to connect the routers and switches
45.431644
if you have the option always show port labels and logical workspace in the Preferences menu of packet tracer enabled
53.234291
the labels will appear next to the devices
55.786652
but I have this option turned off
57.795282
we will use CDP or Cisco discovery protocol to identify the interfaces
65.096571
CDP is a very useful tool
68.209152
and I will create a lab dedicated to using CDP in the future
71.969467
but for this lab all we need to know is one command
75.173503
that is show CDP neighbors
78.333514
let's give it a try on switch one first
81.059055
I'll type in able to enter privileged exec mode
85.571686
this is where we use the command
88.506662
show CDP neighbors
90.417569
as you can see switch 1 is connected to r1
95.005788
and the local interface meaning the interface on this device is fastethernet 0/1
100.969255
let's go to r1
103.046601
enable show CDP neighbors
107.714236
our one is connected to switch 1 on the Fast Ethernet 0 interface
113.346247
but something's missing
115.672844
where's our - well because I have linked lights enabled on packet tracer
120.699267
you might have noticed something is wrong
123.420657
let's troubleshoot a little bit
125.766684
think of potential causes first at layer 1 or the physical layer of the OSI model
132.031954
is the cable plugged in
134.467056
yes it is
135.60099
as you can see here in packet tracer
137.451453
are the interfaces turned on
139.987576
let's check
141.026169
I'll use the show IP interface brief command to check
146.669395
well we were going to use CDP to discover which interface r1 is connected to are two through
153.622681
but as we can see there is only one serial interface serial zero
159.08914
and it's administrative lead down
162.101767
that means if we do a show run command
164.56889
which I will do now
166.199811
we should see the shutdown command on the serial interface
169.015846
I didn't configure this
171.716357
this is by default
172.605723
let's fix that
174.007918
conf no shutdown
179.757747
let's check on our to also
182.39393
enable show IP interface brief
186.24296
again it is shutdown
188.130114
conf T interface serial zero no shutdown
193.791351
okay
195.666509
now let's return to r1
197.353092
this can take some time but if I enter show CDP neighbors again
203.218257
I should see our two
205.116741
there it is
207.684985
r1 is connected to our - through the serial zero interface
211.641346
let's run the command on our two
215.513918
type end to return to privileged exec mode
219.417508
show CDP neighbors
222.974449
r2 is also connected to r1 through the serial zero interface
233.130465
and switch two through the Fast Ethernet zero interface
236.115336
finally let's move on to switch two
240.601434
enable show CDP neighbors
246.1742
as you can see switch 2 is connected to R 2 through the Fast Ethernet 0-1 interface
252.643814
step 1 is now complete
255.471895
step2 asks us to identify which end of the serial connection is DCE
265.096818
and which end is DTE
267.39343
in serial connections one side is DCE or data communications equipment
272.575616
and one side is DTE or data terminal equipment
276.184652
the most important difference between the two is that the DCE device supplies the clock signal that paces the communications
283.744393
which will adjust in the next step
286.779967
to identify which is which let's go to r1 first
291.616351
we'll use the command show controllers serial zero
295.956611
if we just type show controllers
298.823908
we would be overwhelmed with information about every interface on the router
303.236244
so make sure to specify serial zero
306.247824
can you find what we're looking for
309.63548
there it is
311.101373
and this side is the DCE
313.443728
you can also see the clock rate mentioned earlier
316.710507
well now I know which side is DC e
320.685413
that means R 2 should be DTE but let's check anyway
325.399466
let's hop onto r2
328.061367
show controllers serial zero
331.053586
as expected R 2 is DTE
334.817174
step two is now complete
336.833121
for step three we have to set the clock rate on the DCE end to 64 kilobits per second
345.587313
so let's go back to r1
348.632922
we have to configure the serial zero interface
352.524099
so conf t then interface serial zero
356.709099
now we are in interface configuration mode
359.782783
the clock rate is set with the clock rate command
364.041079
let's use the question mark to see what options we have
367.792055
as you can see here these options are listed in bits per second
372.757799
our task is to set the speed to 64 kilobits per second
377.548125
which is 64,000 bits per second
380.617687
so let's do that
382.182228
that's all for step three
384.452651
we don't have to do anything on the DTE side
387.003249
step four tells us to set the IP addresses of the serial interfaces of r1 and r2 to 192.168.0.1 / 24 and 192.168.0.2 /24
404.778665
interface configuration mode on r1
409.050174
so let's configure r1
410.87602
IP address 192.168.1.1 at him this is something you should know if not don't worry about it
426.513926
it's 255.255.255.0
430.565633
there we go
432.043959
now let's do the same on r2
434.811706
conf t interface serial zero
439.66486
IP address 192.168.0.2
444.158026
that's all for step four
449.659766
finally Step five asks us to test connectivity between the routers
456.591307
since we're already on r2
458.750807
let's do it from here
460.183246
type end to return to privileged exec mode
463.268323
the IP address of our one serial zero interface is 192.168.0.1 so
470.39099
ping 192.168.0.1
474.510172
as you can see we have connectivity between the routers
478.626241
that's all for this lab
