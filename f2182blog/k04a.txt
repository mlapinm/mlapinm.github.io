welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer

practice lab you can download the lab

file from the link in the description in

this lab we will be working with two

routers r1 and r2 and two switches

switch 1 and switch 2 we will configure

and test a serial connection between the

two routers note that I have already

configured the host names of each of the

devices beforehand try to complete the

lab yourself first then continue

watching this video if you have trouble

or watch after to check your solution

step one asks us to use CVP to discover

which interfaces are used to connect the

routers and switches if you have the

option always show port labels and

logical workspace in the Preferences

menu of packet tracer enabled the labels

will appear next to the devices but I

have this option turned off we will use

CDP or Cisco discovery protocol to

identify the interfaces CDP is a very

useful tool and I will create a lab

dedicated to using CDP in the future but

for this lab all we need to know is one

command that is show CDP neighbors let's

give it a try on switch one first I'll

type in able to enter privileged exec

mode this is where we use the command

show CDP neighbors as you can see switch

1 is connected to r1 and the local

interface meaning the interface on this

device is fastethernet 0/1 let's go to

r1 enable show CDP neighbors our one is

connected to switch 1 on the Fast

Ethernet 0 interface but something's

missing where's our - well because I

have linked lights enabled on packet

tracer you might have noticed something

is wrong let's troubleshoot a little bit

think of potential causes first at layer

1 or the physical layer of the OSI model

is the cable plugged in

yes it is as you can see here in packet

tracer are the interfaces turned on

let's check I'll use the show IP

interface brief command to check well we

were going to use CDP to discover which

interface r1 is connected to are to

through but as we can see there is only

one serial interface serial zero and

it's administrative lead Ã¡own that means

if we do a show run command which I will

do now we should see the shutdown

command on the serial interface

I didn't configure this this is by

default let's fix that conf

no shutdown let's check on our to also

enable show IP interface brief again it

is shutdown conf T interface serial zero

no shutdown okay

now let's return to r1 this can take

some time but if I enter show CDP

neighbors again I should see our - there

it is

r1 is connected to our - through the

serial zero interface let's run the

command on our to type end to return to

privileged exec mode show CDP neighbors

- is also connected to r1 through the

serial zero interface and switch -

through the Fast Ethernet zero interface

finally let's move on to switch to

enable show CDP neighbors as you can see

switch 2 is connected to R 2 through the

Fast Ethernet 0-1 interface step 1 is

now complete

step2 asks us to identify which end of

the serial connection is DCE

and which end is DTE in serial

connections one side is DCE

or data communications equipment and one

side is DTE or data terminal equipment

the most important difference between

the two is that the DCE device supplies

the clock signal that paces the

communications which will adjust in the

next step to identify which is which

let's go to r1 first we'll use the

command show controllers serial zero if

we just type show controllers we would

be overwhelmed with information about

every interface on the router so make

sure to specify serial zero can you find

what we're looking for there it is and

this side is the DCE

you can also see the clock rate

mentioned earlier well now I know which

side is DC e that means R 2 should be

DTE but let's check anyway

let's hop onto our to show controllers

serial zero as expected R 2 is DTE step

two is now complete

for step three we have to set the clock

rate on the DCE end to 64 kilobits per

second so let's go back to our one we

have to configure the serial zero

interface so compte then interface

serial zero now we are in interface

configuration mode the clock rate is set

with the clock rate command let's use

the question mark to see what options we

have as you can see here these options

are listed in bits per second our task

is to set the speed to 64 kilobits per

second which is 64,000 bits per second

so let's do that that's all for step

three we don't have to do anything on

the DTE side step four tells us to set

the IP addresses of the serial

interfaces of r1 and r2 to 192.168.1 /

24 and 192.168 to

interface configuration mode on r1 so

let's configure r1 IP address

192.168.1.1 at him this is something you

should know if not don't worry about it

it's 255.255.255.0 there we go now let's

do the same on r2 conf t interface

serial zero IP address 192.168.0.0

that's all for step four

finally Step five asks us to test

connectivity between the routers since

we're already on our - let's do it from

here type end to return to privileged

exec mode the IP address of our one

serial zero interface is 192.168.0.1 so

ping 192.168.0.1 as you can see we have

connectivity between the routers that's
