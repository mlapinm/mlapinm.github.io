Thanks for your help. Let’s get started.
22.390
In this lab we’ll configure IP addresses on a Cisco router.
27.060
This is like the demo topology I used in Day 8’s main video, I just changed the IP addresses.
33.520
We still have one class A network, 15.0.0.0/8, one class B network, 182.98.0.0/16, and one
45.611
class C network, 201.191.20.0/24. Let’s get started.
53.890
The first step is to configure R1’s hostname.
56.580
I haven’t done any configurations yet on R1, so it still has the default hostname of ‘router’.
63.490
Let’s go on to the CLI of R1.
68.229
Now I’ll use enable to enter privileged exec mode.
71.479
Then, to configure the hostname, we have to be in global config mode, so ‘conf t’.
78.280
Now let’s set the hostname. Hostname R1.
82.240
Okay, you can see the prompt changes to display the new hostname.
86.509
That’s all for step 1.
89.679
Step 2 is to use a ‘show’ command to view a list of R1’s interfaces, their IP addresses, status, etc.
97.710
Do you remember what command that is?
99.530
It’s a very helpful command which you’ll use a lot as you configure Cisco routers.
104.109
It’s show ip interface brief.
108.200
But as you can see, the command doesn’t work. Why is that?
112.270
Well, its because ‘show’ commands are normally done from privileged exec mode.
117.649
However, let me use the ‘up’ arrow to return to the previous command, then I’ll
123.240
use the shortcut ‘control A’, so hold the control key and press A, and then cursor returns
129.869
to the beginning of the line.
131.780
Then, type ‘do’ in front of the command, and now it lets me enter the command from global config mode.
139.860
Now you can see a list of interfaces, their IP addresses, which are unset at
144.439
the moment, and their statuses.
146.850
Remember, the ‘status’ column indicates the Layer 1 status.
152.100
Currently their status is administratively down, because Cisco router interfaces have
157.069
the ‘shutdown’ command applied to them by default.
160.830
The protocol column indicates the layer 2 status of the interface.
165.510
Because layer 1 is shutdown, layer 2 cant operate, so they are all down.
171.099
We will configure gigabitethernet0/0, 0/1, and 0/2 in this lab, so they should all become UP, UP afterwards.
180.790
Step 3 is to configure the appropriate IP addresses on R1’s interfaces, and enable them.
187.579
We are also instructed to configure appropriate interface descriptions.
191.640
Let’s start on the gigabitethernet0/0 interface.
196.830
Just for this first interface, I’ll type out the whole command. Interface gigabitethernet 0/0.
203.960
There we go, as you can see the prompt has changed to show that I’m in interface configuration mode.
212.200
Let’s configure the IP address.
215.060
Once again, I’ll use the full commands for this first interface.
218.610
Ip address 15.255.255.254, now what’s the appropriate subnet mask for a /8 prefix length? It’s 255.0.0.0.
233.510
Now let’s configure a description.
235.609
I’ll indicate that this interface is connected to switch 1.
240.370
description, I'll put two hashtags, to SW1, and then again, hashtags.
247.340
You can use different descriptions if you want, this is just how I do descriptions.
251.950
Finally, let’s enable the interface. No shutdown.
257.070
Immediately, I get two messages indicating that the interface has come up.
263.139
Before checking on the status of the interface, I’ll configure the other two interfaces.
269.560
To switch to configuring another interface, I don’t have to exit back to global config mode first.
276.090
I can just type ‘interface g0/1’, and now I’m in interface config mode for gigabitethernet 0/1.
283.400
Let’s set the IP address. IP address 182.98.255.254.
293.850
The subnet mask for a /16 prefix length is 255.255.0.0. And the description.
301.990
Description ## to SW2 ##. Let’s enable it. No shut.
309.760
Okay, now let’s go to the last interface. Int g0/2.
319.300
Ip address 201.191.20.254, and the subnet mask for a /24 prefix length is 255.255.255.0. Next, the description.
331.680
Description ## to SW3 ##. Finally, let’s enable it. No shut.
340.259
Okay, since we’re done with the configurations I’ll use the command ‘end’ to go back
345.040
to privileged exec mode.
346.630
Alternatively, I could have used the ‘exit’ command twice.
351.479
Once to return to global config mode, and then a second time to return to privileged exec mode.
357.900
Now let’s check on the status of the interfaces.
360.810
Show ip interface brief.
363.740
Now you can see the IP addresses we configured, the method lists ‘manual’ instead of unset,
370.520
and the layer 1 and layer 2 statuses of the interfaces are up and up.
375.169
Now, step 5 says to view the running config to confirm the changes, and then save the config. Show running-config.
385.039
Here are the interfaces.
387.190
You can see the descriptions, and ip addresses we configured.
391.770
Notice the default duplex auto and speed auto commands.
395.770
Also, if you look at the vlan1 interface, you can see the shutdown command, which as
401.490
I said is applied by default to cisco router interfaces.
404.780
Okay, let’s save the config.
407.750
I mentioned in a previous video that there are a few ways to save the config. Copy running-config startup-config. Write memory. Or, just write.
418.080
I like to use the shortcut version of write, W R. There we go.
425.289
Step 6 is to configure the IP addresses of PC1, PC2, and PC3.
430.540
I’ll go on PC1 first. To configure the IP address, click config up here.
438.300
First, notice that I pre-configured the gateway here.
441.449
I’ll talk about what the purpose of the gateway is when we talk more about routing,
445.889
but notice that its R1’s IP address.
449.400
Now, to configure the PC's IP address, click on fastethernet0 here, that is PC1’s network interface card.
458.389
And then here you can configure the IP address. 15.0.0.1.
463.790
And look at the subnet mask.
465.909
It automatically fills in 255.0.0.0, since this is a class A address.
472.319
Okay, now we can exit out of here.
474.740
Let’s do the same on PC2. Click on PC2. Click config. Click on fastethernet0.
484.319
The IP address is 182.98.0.1, and once again it automatically fills in the subnet mask,
492.810
this time 255.255.0.0 because this is a class B address.
499.770
Now let’s go on PC3. Click on PC3. Click config. Fastethernet0.
507.060
IP address of 201.191.20.1.
513.289
And this time the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, for this class C address.
520.349
Okay, finally let’s go back to PC1 and try to ping. Click desktop, then command prompt.
529.900
Now I’ll try to ping PC2. Ping 182.98.0.1.
543.160
Okay, looks like PC1 can reach PC2. How about PC3? Ping 201.191.20.1.
558.300
Great, PC1 can ping PC3 as well.
563.120
So, in this lab we looked at how to configure IP addresses on router interfaces, how to
568.540
configure interface descriptions, and how to enable interfaces with the ‘no shutdown’ command.
575.180
We also configured IP addresses on PCs in packet tracer and confirmed reachability with ping.
581.450
That’s all for this lab.
