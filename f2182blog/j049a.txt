6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,090
Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,940
Also, remember to sign up via the link in
the description to get all of the lab files

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,980
for this course, so you can try it out yourself
in packet tracer.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,940
If you want more labs like these, I highly
recommend picking up Boson’s NetSim for

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,769
the CCNA, click the link in the video description
to check it out.

11
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:38,140
It’s a network simulator like packet tracer,
but it’s even better, and it includes all

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,640
of these guided labs to not only help you
get hands-on practice configuring and troubleshooting,

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,440
but also deepen your understanding of the
exam topics.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,160
I used it myself when studying for my certifications,
so I feel confident about recommending it

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,019
to all of you.

16
00:00:54,019 --> 00:01:00,019
If you want to get your own copy of NetSim,
please follow the link in the video description.

17
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:05,050
In this lab we’ll do some basic OSPF configurations
in this small network.

18
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:10,350
This is very similar to Day 25’s lab, EIGRP
configuration, with a few small differences.

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,750
Let’s get started.

20
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,550
First of all, before recording this video
I already completed step 1.

21
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,390
I want you to get some extra practice with
the basics like configuring host names and

22
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,710
IP addresses, but at this point in the course
I don’t think there’s any need to record

23
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,350
myself doing it.

24
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:32,920
So, first up I’ll do steps 2 and 3 on each
router.

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,660
Step 2 is to configure a loopback interface
on each router.

26
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,840
As I have explained before, a loopback interface
is a virtual interface in the router, it’s

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,670
not a physical interface.

28
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,930
I’ll give a brief overview of them in one
of these OSPF videos, but basically they are

29
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,310
useful in that they can always be in an up/up
state, unlike physical interfaces which can

30
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,230
go down due to hardware failures, etc.

31
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,160
Then step 3 is to do some basic OSPF configurations
on each router.

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,550
I’ll start on R4 and then work toward R1.

33
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,230
First enter privileged exec mode with ENABLE.

34
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,420
Then CONF T. Let’s configure that loopback
interface.

35
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,739
INTERFACE L0.

36
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,400
Notice these messages indicating that the
interface has come up as soon as I create

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,500
the interface.

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,900
IP ADDRESS 4.4.4.4 255.255.255.255.

39
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,269
Let me check that it was created.

40
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:36,660
DO SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.

41
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,999
There it is, and the IP address is 4.4.4.4.

42
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:44,599
By the way, if you really want to make sure
the subnet mask is correctly configured you

43
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:49,180
need to use a different command, because as
you can see the subnet mask is not displayed

44
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,550
in the output of SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.

45
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,950
So let’s use this command instead.

46
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,220
DO SHOW INTERFACE L0.

47
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:03,660
Look here, ‘Internet address is 4.4.4.4/32’.

48
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,739
I like using SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF for a
quick look at interfaces, but sometimes you

49
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:10,819
might have to use other commands.

50
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:14,400
Okay, now let’s configure OSPF.

51
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,470
ROUTER OSPF, and I’ll use a process ID of
4.

52
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,659
Remember what I said in the lecture video,
this process ID is only significant to the

53
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:27,169
local router, the other routers don’t care
about it.

54
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:31,150
Just to show that, I’ll use a different
process ID on each router, and you will see

55
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,939
that they still become OSPF neighbors.

56
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:38,549
Next up let’s activate OSPF on R4’s interfaces.

57
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:44,239
I think I showed you this trick in the EIGRP
lab, but if you want to activate OSPF on all

58
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,680
interfaces at once you can do this.

59
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,950
NETWORK 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 AREA 0.

60
00:03:53,950 --> 00:04:01,909
That’s configuring a range of 0.0.0.0/0,
which includes all IPv4 addresses.

61
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:09,389
Remember that the network command uses a wildcard
mask, so 255.255.255.255 is like a subnet

62
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:11,659
mask of 0.0.0.0.

63
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:16,579
So, OSPF is enabled on all interfaces.

64
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,549
In real networks it’s recommended that you
be more precise about which interfaces you

65
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:25,669
activate OSPF on, I just wanted to show you
that little trick for quickly setting up OSPF

66
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:26,759
in labs.

67
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:32,150
Now, we are also instructed to configure passive
interfaces where appropriate.

68
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:38,710
F1/0 and F2/0 are connected to routers, so
we shouldn’t make them passive, but G0/0

69
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,580
should be passive.

70
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,060
PASSIVE-INTERFACE G0/0.

71
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,990
Not only G0/0, but Loopback0 also.

72
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,120
Routers will send OSPF hello messages on loopback
interfaces, even though they are connected

73
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,389
to nothing.

74
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:56,110
So, PASSIVE-INTERFACE L0.

75
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:01,889
I’ll take a look at some OSPF show commands
when we get to R1, but for now let me quickly

76
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:06,199
go through the configurations on R3 and R2.

77
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,759
R3 next.

78
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,539
ENABLE.

79
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:14,800
CONF T. INTERFACE L0.

80
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,889
IP ADDRESS 3.3.3.3 255.255.255.255.

81
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,610
Now let’s configure OSPF.

82
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,150
ROUTER OSPF, and this time a process ID of
3.

83
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:35,460
Let’s try another way of enabling OSPF on
each interface, specifying the exact IP address

84
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,789
with a /32 mask.

85
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:40,430
First up, F1/0.

86
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:46,400
NETWORK 10.0.13.2 0.0.0.0 AREA 0.

87
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,850
Next, F2/0.

88
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:54,290
NETWORK 10.0.34.1 0.0.0.0 AREA 0.

89
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,639
Finally, Loopback0.

90
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,189
NETWORK 3.3.3.3 0.0.0.0 AREA 0.

91
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:07,440
Here on R3 there’s only one interface we
need to make a passive interface, Loopback0.

92
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,440
PASSIVE-INTERFACE L0.

93
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:17,580
Okay that’s all for R3, next up I’ll configure
R2.

94
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,260
ENABLE.

95
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,620
CONF T. INTERFACE L0.

96
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:29,439
IP ADDRESS 2.2.2.2 255.255.255.255.

97
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,960
Now let’s configure OSPF.

98
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,330
Again, I’ll use a different process ID,
but usually I’d just use process ID 1 for

99
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,129
all routers.

100
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:40,069
ROUTER OSPF 2.

101
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:45,490
I’ll enable OSPF on both physical interfaces
first like this.

102
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:51,379
NETWORK 10.0.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0.

103
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,699
Then the loopback interface.

104
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:59,050
NETWORK 2.2.2.2 0.0.0.0 AREA 0.

105
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,830
And let’s make that a passive interface.

106
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,270
PASSIVE-INTERFACE L0.

107
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:08,469
Okay, that’s all here on R2.

108
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:12,240
Finally let’s move to R1.

109
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,880
ENABLE.

110
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,920
CONF T. INTERFACE L0.

111
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:23,360
IP ADDRESS 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.255.

112
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,990
Now let’s configure OSPF.

113
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,780
ROUTER OSPF 1.

114
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,740
So, we are told we don’t need to enable
OSPF on the Internet link.

115
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,740
Why is that?

116
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,659
Well, we are going to advertise a default
route to the other routers later, but there’s

117
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:44,250
no need for them to know about this point-to-point
connection between R1 and ISPR1.

118
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:49,199
If R2 needs to reach a server over the Internet,
for example, it just needs to know to send

119
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,680
the traffic to R1, there’s no need to know
what subnet is used for the connection between

120
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,540
R1 and ISPR1.

121
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,669
So, we won’t activate OSPF on the interface
unnecessarily.

122
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:03,949
I’ll do each interface one by one.

123
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:10,259
NETWORK 10.0.12.0 0.0.0.3 AREA 0.

124
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:15,999
NETWORK 10.0.13.0 0.0.0.3 AREA 0.

125
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:22,090
NETWORK 1.1.1.1 0.0.0.0 AREA 0.

126
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:26,810
Notice that for each router I configured the
network statements a little differently.

127
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,970
On R4 I used a single command to enable OSPF
on all interfaces.

128
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:36,620
On R3 I specified the exact address on each
interface.

129
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,789
On R2 I enabled the two physical interfaces
with one command.

130
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:46,300
Here on R1 I configured the network address
of each interface.

131
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,200
Just be aware that there is more than one
way to enable OSPF on each interface.

132
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,820
Okay, now let’s make Loopback0 a passive
interface.

133
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,860
PASSIVE-INTERFACE L0.

134
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,490
Before checking out some show commands here,
let’s do step 4 and configure R1 to advertise

135
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,610
a default route.

136
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,600
First I’ll do DEFAULT-INFORMATION ORIGINATE.

137
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:15,130
Currently, a default route isn’t configured
though, so let’s EXIT, and now configure

138
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,130
it.

139
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:27,540
IP ROUTE 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0, and set the next
hop to ISPR1’s G0/0/0 interface, 203.0.113.2.

140
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:34,040
Okay, we’re done with the configurations
so I’ll use EXIT to return to privileged

141
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,290
exec mode.

142
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,040
First let’s check out SHOW IP PROTOCOLS.

143
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,899
We’ve already covered the output of this
command, I just want to highlight that the

144
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:49,360
loopback interface’s IP address of 1.1.1.1
became the router ID, and because we configured

145
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,130
DEFAULT-INFORMATION ORIGINATE, it says ‘It
is an autonomous system boundary router’,

146
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,550
an ASBR.

147
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:02,670
An ASBR advertises outside networks into the
OSPF domain, such as when R1 advertises a

148
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,980
default route to the Internet into the OSPF
domain.

149
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,230
Now let’s look at a few OSPF-specific commands.

150
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,100
I will cover these in detail in the next few
videos, but here’s just a preview of them.

151
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,970
First, to view the Link State Database, LSDB,
use this command.

152
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,060
SHOW IP OSPF DATABASE.

153
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,300
Here you can see all of the LSAs in the LSDB.

154
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,350
Notice there are a few types displayed.

155
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:37,600
‘Router’ link states, ‘Net’ link states,
and ‘Type-5 AS External’ link states.

156
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,510
I’ll talk more about these in the next video.

157
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,800
Here’s another command, to view R1’s OSPF
neighbors.

158
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,320
SHOW IP OSPF NEIGHBOR.

159
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,430
As expected, R2 and R3 are listed as OSPF
neighbors.

160
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:58,020
And one more command, SHOW IP OSPF INTERFACE.

161
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:03,660
You can specify an individual interface if
you want, or just view all interfaces.

162
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,300
This gives details about the current OSPF
settings on the interface, such as the various

163
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,410
timers OSPF uses.

164
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,130
Feel free to look around at the output of
these commands if you want, but I will explain

165
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,610
their output in a future video, just wanted
to make you aware of them.

166
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,870
Finally, let’s do step 5.

167
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:26,770
Check the routing tables of R2, R3, and R4.

168
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,500
What default routes were added?

169
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,649
Let’s check R2 first.

170
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,680
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

171
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:40,980
The default route is down here, via 10.0.12.1,
which is R1, as expected.

172
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,060
Now let’s check R3.

173
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,990
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

174
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:51,320
Okay, R3’s default route is via R1, 10.0.13.1.

175
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,759
Now let’s check R4, and you might see something
a little unexpected.

176
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,900
What do you think the next hop of the default
route will be, R2 or R3?

177
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,579
Note that the connection between R1 and R2
is a gigabitethernet connection, while the

178
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,089
others are fastethernet.

179
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:13,009
Since I already taught you that OSPF uses
interface bandwidth to calculate the metric,

180
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:17,269
you probably expect the path via R2 to be
preferred, and expect that it will be the

181
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:21,220
only one entered into the routing table because
of a lower metric value.

182
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,920
Let’s see.

183
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,639
DO SHOW IP ROUTE.

184
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:31,019
Well, it looks like both routes have been
added, so R4 will load-balance over both paths.

185
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,019
Why is that?

186
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:35,389
Well, I will explain that in future videos.

187
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:40,220
But if you want to do some independent research,
try to find the answer yourself!

188
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,329
If you think you know the answer, post it
in the comment section!

189
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:48,920
Okay, so in this lab we did some basic OSPF
configurations in this network, including

190
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,540
passive interfaces and advertising a default
route.

191
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,700
That’s all for this lab.

192
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,310
Now let’s check out a bonus lab in Boson
NetSim for CCNA.

193
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:05,720
Okay, for today's Boson NetSim lab preview
we're going to take a quick look at this lab

194
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,300
here, planning and configuring single-area
OSPF.

195
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,440
Here is the lab topology, there are four routers.

196
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,890
Routers 1 and 3, and 2 and 4 are connected
with fastethernet.

197
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:24,790
But routers 1 and 2, and 3 and 4 are connected
with a serial connection, and as it says here

198
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:29,330
it is using 'frame relay' as the Layer 2 encapsulation.

199
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:35,519
So, frame relay is a layer 2 encapsulation,
like Ethernet, but it's used on serial connections.

200
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,060
Now, some other options for serial connections
are PPP and HDLC.

201
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,190
Now, in the current CCNA you don't have to
know these in-depth.

202
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:50,399
I will mention them briefly in these OSPF
videos, but the main focus is the Ethernet

203
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,610
layer 2 encapsulation.

204
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:58,860
Okay, down here are the commands you need
to know to complete this lab, the IP addresses

205
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,029
on each device, and then the lab tasks.

206
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:06,250
So, this lab is divided into four main tasks.

207
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:15,170
Verify initial configurations, plan for OSPF,
configure OSPF, and verify OSPF.

208
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:20,980
So, in the first OSPF video, the first lecture
video, I only covered the absolute basics

209
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,330
of OSPF.

210
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,279
So we're not actually ready to complete this
whole lab.

211
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,329
But that's okay, we'll just do task 1 and
a little bit of task 2 so you can see what

212
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:31,550
this lab is like.

213
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,110
And if you want to try it out yourself, you
can get a copy of NetSim from the link in

214
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,890
the description and try it out yourself here
in NetSim.

215
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,420
Okay, task 1.

216
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,160
Verify initial configurations.

217
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,730
Step 1, verify the IP address and state of
each interface on each router.

218
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,900
So, I'm already in the CLI of Router1, so
let's check here.

219
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,009
SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.

220
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:00,010
Let's check with the IP addresses table here.

221
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:08,580
Serial0, 10.1.0.1, looks good, FastEthernet0/1
(*1/0), 10.0.0.1, looks good.

222
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,290
Okay, and they are both up and up.

223
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,290
Now let's check out Router2.

224
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:23,000
To open Router2, click here on the right side
under devices, and click on console.

225
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,810
Okay, serial0/0, 10.1.0.2, looks good.

226
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,220
And fastethernet1/0, 10.2.0.2.

227
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,060
Okay, and they are both up and up.

228
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:41,080
Next I'll check out Router3.

229
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,980
Okay, serial0 is 10.3.0.3, that's correct.

230
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,680
Fastethernet1/0, 10.0.0.3, and that is correct.

231
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:58,640
Okay, and finally I'll check on Router4.

232
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:05,710
Okay, 10.3.0.4 is good, 10.2.0.4, that is
good also.

233
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:12,100
Okay, so all of the IP address configurations
look good, and the interfaces are all up/up.

234
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,620
Okay, next step 2, I'll try some pings.

235
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:24,930
So first from Router1, I'll try to ping these
two interfaces, this one on Router3 and this

236
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,660
one on Router2.

237
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,259
Okay, so I'll go back to Router1.

238
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:37,920
Ping first Router2's serial0/0 interface,
10.1.0.2.

239
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,459
Okay, looks good.

240
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:46,110
And next, Router3's fastethernet1/0 interface,
10.0.0.3.

241
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,300
Okay, no problem.

242
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:57,140
And then step 3, from Router4 ping Router2's
FastEthernet1/0 interface and Router3's serial0/0

243
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,040
interface.

244
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,620
So I'll ping these two interfaces here.

245
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,800
Okay, I'll go on to R4 again.

246
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:11,800
PING 10.2.0.2, that is Router2's fastethernet1/0.

247
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,900
Okay.

248
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,200
And Router3's Serial0/0.

249
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,420
Okay, all looks good.

250
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,760
So the initial configurations are fine.

251
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,870
All the interfaces are up/up and there is
connectivity, they can all ping each other.

252
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:31,820
Next, task 2, plan for OSPF.

253
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,320
All four routers should be members of the
backbone area.

254
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,240
What is the area ID of the backbone?

255
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,880
So, as I said in the last video, the backbone
area is area 0.

256
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,780
Now, for single area OSPF you don't actually
have to use area 0, the backbone, you can

257
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,820
use any area number, area 1 2 3 4 5, whatever
number you want.

258
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:56,210
However generally it's recommended that you
use area 0 for single area OSPF.

259
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,730
And that is one of the requirements of this
lab.

260
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:05,120
Okay step 2, your configuration should be
specific enough so that as additional networks

261
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,290
are added to the router those networks are
not automatically advertised.

262
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:13,070
Okay, so we have to be specific with our NETWORK
statements.

263
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:20,909
We can't use the trick I showed you earlier,
NETWORK 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255, to activate

264
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:22,590
OSPF on all interfaces.

265
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,400
We should be specific about which networks
we want to advertise.

266
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,290
Okay, the IP routing tables on each router
should be populated with the specific IP subnets

267
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,080
in your network.

268
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,350
Using the IP addresses table, list the specific
networks and masks that should be configured

269
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,130
to satisfy this requirement.

270
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:49,200
So, we should configure the specific subnet
on each interface.

271
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,080
So, all of them are /24, as you can see.

272
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,850
So if you want to know the network address
just change this last number to 0.

273
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:05,280
So, for example on Router1 there is 10.0.0.0/24
and 10.1.0.0/24.

274
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,970
Router2 has 10.1.0.0/24 and 10.2.0.0/24.

275
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:19,350
Router3 has 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.3.0.0/24.

276
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:26,559
And finally Router4 has 10.2.0.0/24 and 10.3.0.0/24.

277
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:32,040
So those are all the subnets.

278
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,320
Okay, so that's step 2.

279
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,890
Step 3, list the OSPF network commands necessary
to accomplish the configuration requirement

280
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,059
in the previous step.

281
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:48,230
Okay, so we'll configure the NETWORK statements
I just said, but you have to make sure to

282
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:56,280
use a wildcard mask, so the /24 would not
be 255.255.255.0, it would be the inverse,

283
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,000
so 0.0.0.255.

284
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,970
So, just to show you the commands that you
would use on each router, let's look at the

285
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,980
lab solutions down here.

286
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,460
And here they are.

287
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:18,000
So, for example on Router1, NETWORK 10.0.0.0
0.0.0.255 AREA 0, and then the same for 10.1.0.0.

288
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,340
And you can check on Router2, 3 and 4 as well.

289
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:30,740
Okay, now from step 4 it talks about some
aspects of OSPF that we haven't covered yet

290
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:37,080
in the last video, for example DR, that stands
for Designated Router, which is an important

291
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,159
topic in OSPF and I will cover it over the
next couple videos.

292
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:44,500
So, I'm going to end this lab preview here.

293
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:49,490
If you want to try this lab and all of these
other OSPF labs out yourself, make sure to
