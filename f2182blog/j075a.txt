8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,840
It’s a network simulator like&nbsp;
packet tracer, but it’s even better,&nbsp;&nbsp;

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,800
and it includes all of these guided labs to not&nbsp;
only help you get hands-on practice configuring&nbsp;&nbsp;

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,720
and troubleshooting, but also deepen your&nbsp;
understanding of the exam topics. I used it myself&nbsp;&nbsp;

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,440
when studying for my certifications, so I feel&nbsp;
confident about recommending it to all of you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,360
In this video we’ll configure DHCP,&nbsp;
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.&nbsp;&nbsp;

14
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,360
As you can see in the network diagram, PC1 and&nbsp;
PC2 don’t have IP addresses yet, and R1’s G0/0&nbsp;&nbsp;

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:23,680
interface doesn’t have an IP address either. We’ll&nbsp;
configure R2 as a DHCP server, R1 as a DHCP client&nbsp;&nbsp;

16
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,480
on its G0/0 interface, and also configure&nbsp;
R1 as a DHCP relay agent. Let’s get started.

17
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:41,040
First, in step 1 we’ll configure three DHCP&nbsp;
pools on R2, one for the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

18
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:49,760
one for the 192.168.2.0/24 subnet, and one for the&nbsp;
connection between R1 and R2. So, I’ll go on R2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

19
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:00,080
ENABLE. CONF T. For POOL1 and POOL2 we are&nbsp;
told to reserve the first 10 host addresses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

20
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,160
I’ll configure those ranges first. Remember,&nbsp;
the IP DHCP EXCLUDED-ADDRESS command&nbsp;&nbsp;

21
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:14,080
is done from global config mode, not DHCP&nbsp;
config mode. So, IP DHCP EXCLUDED-ADDRESS&nbsp;&nbsp;

22
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:22,480
192.168.1.1, that’s the low end of the range,&nbsp;
then 192.168.1.10, the high end of the range.&nbsp;&nbsp;

23
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:31,760
Now I’ll use the up arrow, and change these&nbsp;
to 192.168.2.1 and 192.168.2.10. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

24
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,400
so that reserves the first 10 addresses of POOL1&nbsp;
and POOL2, they won’t be assigned to DHCP clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;

25
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:48,880
Also I’ll reserve .1 from 203.0.113.0/30,&nbsp;
which is R2’s address. IP DHCP EXCLUDED-ADDRESS&nbsp;&nbsp;

26
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:57,120
203.0.113.1. Notice if you want to reserve just a&nbsp;
single address, you can do it like this, no need&nbsp;&nbsp;

27
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:07,280
to specify a range. Now I’ll configure the first&nbsp;
pool. IP DHCP POOL POOL1. First the address range.&nbsp;&nbsp;

28
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:21,920
NETWORK 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0. Then the DNS&nbsp;
server, DNS-SERVER 8.8.8.8. Also the domain name,&nbsp;&nbsp;

29
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:32,812
DOMAIN-NAME jeremysitlab.com. And the default&nbsp;
gateway should be R1. DEFAULT-ROUTER 192.168.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

30
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:43,120
Okay, that’s all for POOL1, now POOL2. IP DHCP&nbsp;
POOL POOL2. I’ll configure those parameters in&nbsp;&nbsp;

31
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:58,480
the same order. NETWORK 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0.&nbsp;
DNS-SERVER 8.8.8.8. DOMAIN-NAME jeremysitlab.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;

32
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:11,680
DEFAULT-ROUTER 192.168.2.1. That’s POOL2, finally&nbsp;
I’ll configure POOL3. IP DHCP POOL POOL3. &nbsp;&nbsp;

33
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:23,120
NETWORK 203.0.113.0 255.255.255.252. That’s it, we won’t&nbsp;
be telling R1 about any DNS servers and such.&nbsp;&nbsp;

34
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,520
Okay let’s check out the configurations.&nbsp;
DO SHOW RUN | SECTION DHCP.&nbsp;&nbsp;

35
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,640
Remember that you can use the ‘pipe’ with keywords&nbsp;
like INCLUDE and SECTION to filter the output of&nbsp;&nbsp;

36
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:45,200
show commands, very useful. Anyway, here you can&nbsp;
see each of the DHCP pools we just configured.

37
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,000
So, R2 is now configured as a DHCP server. I’m&nbsp;
going to change the order of the tasks a bit and&nbsp;&nbsp;

38
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:03,120
go on to the CLI of PC2 now. Let’s check if it&nbsp;
can get an IP address from R2. IPCONFIG /RENEW.&nbsp;&nbsp;

39
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:12,400
And there we go, it was assigned 192.168.2.11, the&nbsp;
first available address. Let’s check more details.&nbsp;&nbsp;

40
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:22,000
IPCONFIG /ALL. Okay, there’s the domain name&nbsp;
jeremysitlab.com. The IP address and subnet mask,&nbsp;&nbsp;

41
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:30,960
default gateway of R2, its DHCP server, also&nbsp;
R2, and the DNS server 8.8.8.8. Looks good.

42
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,960
Okay, now I’ll do step 2, which is to&nbsp;
configure R1’s G0/0 interface as a DHCP client.&nbsp;&nbsp;

43
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:51,920
So let’s go on R1. ENABLE. CONF T. INTERFACE&nbsp;
G0/0. To make R1 a DHCP client on this interface,&nbsp;&nbsp;

44
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,520
the command is IP ADDRESS DHCP.&nbsp;
Now I’ll enable the interface,&nbsp;&nbsp;

45
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,920
NO SHUTDOWN. So, R1 will broadcast a DHCP&nbsp;
Discover message to R2, which should reply&nbsp;&nbsp;

46
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:11,440
with a DHCP Offer, then R1 will send a DHCP&nbsp;
Request, and finally R2 sends a DHCP Ack,&nbsp;&nbsp;

47
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,840
and as you can see here, R1 was assigned&nbsp;
the IP address 203.0.113.2, with a /30 mask.

48
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Next, in step 3 let’s configure R1 as a DHCP&nbsp;
relay agent for the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

49
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,840
It’s only a single command, but which&nbsp;
interface should we configure it on?&nbsp;&nbsp;

50
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,880
It should be the interface connected to&nbsp;
the DHCP clients, so R1’s G0/1 interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;

51
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:50,400
INTERFACE G0/1. The command is IP HELPER-ADDRESS,&nbsp;
and then the IP address of the DHCP server,&nbsp;&nbsp;

52
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:59,120
which is R2, so 203.0.113.1. Okay,&nbsp;
that’s it, R1 is now a DHCP relay agent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

53
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:08,320
Finally let’s see if PC1 can get an address from&nbsp;
R2, the DHCP server, via R1, the DHCP relay agent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

54
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,840
I’ll go on to the CLI of PC1. And let’s&nbsp;
try to get an IP address. IPCONFIG&nbsp;&nbsp;

55
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:22,960
/RENEW. When I was testing out this lab I had to&nbsp;
do the command a few times, some processes like&nbsp;&nbsp;

56
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,840
ARP are a little slow in Packet Tracer, but as you&nbsp;
can see PC1 was able to get an IP address from R2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

57
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:37,920
Let’s check the details. IPCONFIG /ALL.&nbsp;
Looks like it has all of the information&nbsp;&nbsp;

58
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:44,080
we configured in the pool on R2, domain&nbsp;
name, the address is in the correct range,&nbsp;&nbsp;

59
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,560
subnet mask and default gateway are&nbsp;
correct, and so is the DNS server.

60
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:58,400
Okay, in this lab we configured a DHCP server,&nbsp;
DHCP client, and DHCP relay agent in Cisco IOS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

61
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,840
That’s all for this lab. Next let’s take a look at&nbsp;
a bonus lab in Boson Software’s NetSim for CCNA.

62
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:15,440
Okay here's today's Boson NetSim lab preview.&nbsp;
There are five DHCP labs in Boson NetSim for CCNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

63
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:23,680
And the one I have selected for today is this&nbsp;
one, troubleshooting DHCP. So here's Router1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

64
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:32,800
a DHCP server. And it's connected to three&nbsp;
LANs, here. VLAN100, VLAN200, and VLAN300.&nbsp;&nbsp;

65
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:47,671
Okay, this is the IP address information,&nbsp;
looks like VLAN100 is 192.168.1.0/24,&nbsp;&nbsp;

66
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:58,080
and then 200 and 300 are 2.0/24 and 3.0/24. Okay,&nbsp;
these are the tasks. For this lab preview I'm just&nbsp;&nbsp;

67
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:07,360
going to do task 1 and task 2. And you can do task&nbsp;
3 on your own if you get NetSim. Okay, so let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

68
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,160
check out task 1. After some configuration&nbsp;
changes are made to the network, users are&nbsp;&nbsp;

69
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,880
reporting that PCs in VLAN100, 200, and 300 are no&nbsp;
longer configured with IP addressing information.&nbsp;&nbsp;

70
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,720
In this task you will verify that none of the&nbsp;
DHCP clients are able to obtain IP addressing&nbsp;&nbsp;

71
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:32,480
information from Router1. Okay, so step 1. On&nbsp;
each PC, verify that IP addressing information&nbsp;&nbsp;

72
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,720
is missing from the configurations.&nbsp;
Okay, so let's do that on each PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;

73
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:53,040
Okay, PC1 first. IPCONFIG. Indeed it's all&nbsp;
0.0.0.0, so no configuration on PC1. Or PC2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

74
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,320
Or PC3. Okay, on Router1 display&nbsp;
information about DHCP bindings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

75
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:08,400
Has Router1 binded any IP addressing information&nbsp;
to any other devices in the topology?&nbsp;&nbsp;

76
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:17,760
Okay let's check here. The command is SHOW&nbsp;
IP DHCP BINDING. Okay, nothing displays&nbsp;&nbsp;

77
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,840
here so there are no bindings. Router1 has&nbsp;
not leased any addresses to DHCP clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;

78
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,960
Okay, from Router1 attempt to ping Switch1's,&nbsp;
Switch2's, and Switch3's VLAN interfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;

79
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,760
So each of the switches has an IP address on its&nbsp;
VLAN interface which was statically assigned. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

80
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:49,600
let's see if Router1 can ping those. First&nbsp;
Switch1. Okay, no problems there. Switch2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

81
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:58,320
And Switch3. Okay, no problems. Next,&nbsp;
step 4. On each switch in the topology&nbsp;&nbsp;

82
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:05,920
verify that the port connecting to the relevant&nbsp;
PC is in the UP state. Okay, let's do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

83
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,800
So, the interface on each switch is&nbsp;
FastEthernet0/12, that is connected to the PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;

84
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,920
Okay, I'll look on Switch1 first.&nbsp;
I'll use SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.&nbsp;&nbsp;

85
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:38,560
And FastEthernet0/12 is UP and UP. How about&nbsp;
on Switch2? Okay, UP and UP. And Switch3.&nbsp;&nbsp;

86
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:48,320
Again, UP/UP. Okay, so looks like there are no&nbsp;
problems with physical connectivity here. So DHCP,&nbsp;&nbsp;

87
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,840
something in Router1's DHCP configuration is&nbsp;
likely the problem, but let's check in task 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

88
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:04,080
Here, troubleshoot DHCP services. In this task&nbsp;
you will troubleshoot the DHCP configuration on&nbsp;&nbsp;

89
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:10,240
Router1. You have completed this task when Router1&nbsp;
is able to successfully bind DHCP addresses&nbsp;&nbsp;

90
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:17,360
to clients. The DHCP pools in this lab should&nbsp;
contain a range of 254 available IP addresses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

91
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,840
So that is /24. But the first 9 addresses&nbsp;
should be excluded from that range.&nbsp;&nbsp;

92
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:32,240
Okay, let's do that. So, step 1 on Router1.&nbsp;
Display the DHCP pool configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;

93
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,920
Okay, so SHOW, I'll use SHOW RUN, this is&nbsp;
very convenient, SHOW RUN | SECTION DHCP.&nbsp;&nbsp;

94
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,720
Okay, what do you notice about the size of VLAN200&nbsp;&nbsp;

95
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,320
compared to the number of leased addresses? Well,&nbsp;
there were no leased addresses. The size is /24,&nbsp;&nbsp;

96
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,240
so Router1 is not leasing any addresses&nbsp;
at the moment. Actually there's another&nbsp;&nbsp;

97
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,800
command you can use. I didn't show this in&nbsp;
the lecture video but SHOW IP DHCP POOL.&nbsp;&nbsp;

98
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:17,680
And here you can see that same information for&nbsp;
VLAN200. Total addresses, 254. Leased addresses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

99
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,720
0. Okay, display the DHCP server statistics.&nbsp;&nbsp;

100
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:33,840
Okay, so this is another command I didn't show in&nbsp;
the lecture video, SHOW IP DHCP SERVER STATISTICS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

101
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:42,560
Okay, so we can see there are three address&nbsp;
pools but no messages, no DHCP messages received&nbsp;&nbsp;

102
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:50,400
or sent. Okay, so here in step 3 it says,&nbsp;
based on the data you have collected so far,&nbsp;&nbsp;

103
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:57,280
what is most likely preventing the DHCP server&nbsp;
from assigning IP addresses to clients in VLAN200?&nbsp;&nbsp;

104
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,840
Okay, let me look at that configuration once more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

105
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,120
Okay I think I found it. So, this is another&nbsp;
command I didn't show in the lecture video&nbsp;&nbsp;

106
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:16,240
because it's usually enabled by default.&nbsp;
That is the SERVICE DHCP command. So, if&nbsp;&nbsp;

107
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,480
this command is enabled it means the router will&nbsp;
respond to DHCP messages. If this is disabled,&nbsp;&nbsp;

108
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,400
as is the case now, it will&nbsp;
just drop any DHCP messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;

109
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,320
So on Cisco routers it's enabled by default, but&nbsp;
it looks like someone disabled it on this router.&nbsp;&nbsp;

110
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,280
So that is why Router1 is not receiving&nbsp;
or responding to any DHCP messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;

111
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,840
Okay, step 5. Issue any commands that are&nbsp;
required to solve the problem you have identified.&nbsp;&nbsp;

112
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:52,880
Okay, so to disable it it was NO SERVICE&nbsp;
DHCP, so to enable it it's SERVICE DHCP.&nbsp;&nbsp;

113
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,160
And that's it. Okay, step 6, display&nbsp;
DHCP binding information. Has the DHCP&nbsp;&nbsp;

114
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,160
server binded IP addressing information to any&nbsp;
devices in the topology? If so, which devices?&nbsp;&nbsp;

115
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:16,240
Alright let's check those bindings again. Okay&nbsp;
looks like two devices have gotten a DHCP address.&nbsp;&nbsp;

116
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:26,000
One in VLAN200 and one in VLAN300. So it seems&nbsp;
there is still a problem here with VLAN100,&nbsp;&nbsp;

117
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,200
probably some configuration on Router1. But let's&nbsp;
see, let's confirm that this is PC2 and this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

118
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:49,120
PC3. Okay, so 192.168.2.10. Oh yes, it displays&nbsp;
it right here, mask /24. IPCONFIG /ALL. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

119
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,600
looks good. And how about PC3? This should be&nbsp;
192.168.3.10. And yes it is, that's correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;

120
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:10,240
Okay, perfect. So it looks like that NO&nbsp;
SERVICE DHCP command was one of the problems,&nbsp;&nbsp;

121
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,880
but there is clearly another problem because&nbsp;
PC1 still doesn't have an IP address.&nbsp;&nbsp;

122
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,880
So, I assume in task 3 we would solve that, but&nbsp;
I'll leave today's Boson NetSim lab preview here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

123
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,960
Okay, so that was a quick look at&nbsp;
Boson Software's NetSim for CCNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

124
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,840
