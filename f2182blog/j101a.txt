00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,860
Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:25,980
If you want more labs like this, I highly
recommend Boson Software’s NetSim for CCNA.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,560
NetSim is a network simulator like Packet
Tracer, but it’s far more powerful and contains

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,049
over 100 detailed guided labs covering the
CCNA exam topics.

10
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:40,840
If you want to get NetSim, follow the link
in the description.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,290
In this lab we’ll look at the topic of HSRP
and STP synchronization.

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,430
This applies regardless of what first hop
redundancy protocol you’re using, but for

13
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,550
this lab we’ll use HSRP.

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:00,471
Basically, HSRP and STP synchronization means
that the HSRP active should be the STP root

15
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:06,030
bridge, and the HSRP standby should be the
STP secondary root bridge.

16
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,680
Why should the HSRP active and the STP root
be synchronized or aligned?

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,900
It’s to ensure that traffic from the end
hosts follows the most direct path to the

18
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,150
default gateway.

19
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:26,020
If the HSRP active router isn’t the STP
root, then traffic from PC1 to DSW1 might

20
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:31,409
not take the direct path to DSW1, it might
take a longer path.

21
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,640
This isn’t a disaster, but it’s obviously
not ideal.

22
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,830
Because STP works by finding the shortest
path to the root, ensuring that the HSRP active

23
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:46,140
router is synchronized with the STP root means
that traffic will follow the most efficient

24
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,500
path.

25
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:54,340
In this lab, we’ll make DSW1 the HSRP active
and STP root for VLAN 10, and make DSW2 the

26
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,850
HSRP active and STP root for VLAN 20.

27
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:06,430
Before configuring HSRP and STP, let’s check
the current state on DSW1.

28
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,590
ENABLE.

29
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,700
SHOW STANDBY BRIEF.

30
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,190
Nothing, so HSRP hasn’t been configured
yet.

31
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,610
Let’s check spanning tree.

32
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,950
SHOW SPANNING-TREE VLAN 10.

33
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:27,290
DSW1 has a root port, G1/0/3 which is connected
to DSW2, so it looks like DSW2 is the root

34
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,870
bridge, not DSW1.

35
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,700
How about VLAN 20?

36
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,420
SHOW SPANNING-TREE VLAN 20.

37
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,160
Same thing here.

38
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,330
Now I’ll get right into configuring DSW1.

39
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,630
CONF T. Let’s configure STP first.

40
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,709
SPANNING-TREE VLAN 10 ROOT PRIMARY.

41
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:53,950
That should make DSW1 the root for VLAN 10,
now let’s ensure it’s the secondary root

42
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,240
for VLAN 20.

43
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,890
SPANNING-TREE VLAN 20 ROOT SECONDARY.

44
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:06,070
Okay, let’s check the status now, VLAN 10
first where DSW1 should be the root.

45
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,450
DO SHOW SPANNING-TREE VLAN 10.

46
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:16,040
Great, DSW1 is the root now as it says up
here, and all ports are designated.

47
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,410
And VLAN 20 next.

48
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,370
DO SHOW SPANNING-TREE VLAN 20.

49
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,870
Now, because we haven’t configured DSW2
yet the ROOT SECONDARY command here actually

50
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:33,750
made DSW1’s priority lower than DSW2’s
so DSW1 became the root for VLAN 20 also.

51
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:41,140
That’s fine, after we configure DSW2 it
will become the root for VLAN 20 again.

52
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:47,829
Now let’s configure HSRP here on DSW1, for
the VLAN10 SVI first.

53
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,310
INTERFACE VLAN 10.

54
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:54,870
I didn’t give any specifics in the description
about the HSRP configurations, but I’ll

55
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,940
make it version 2.

56
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,500
STANDBY VERSION 2.

57
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,250
I’ll make group 10 for VLAN 10.

58
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,880
STANDBY 10 IP, and let’s make the default
gateway .254.

59
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,849
10.0.10.254.

60
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:16,349
I’ll make DSW1’s priority higher than
the default 100 next.

61
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:20,019
STANDBY 10 PRIORITY 105.

62
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,300
And enable preemption too, it’s good to
have.

63
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,069
STANDBY 10 PREEMPT.

64
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:28,150
Okay, VLAN 20 next.

65
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,729
INTERFACE VLAN 20.

66
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:33,190
Let’s enable version 2 here too.

67
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,190
STANDBY VERSION 2.

68
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,969
And then the virtual IP, .254 again.

69
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:41,490
STANDBY 20 IP 10.0.20.254.

70
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:49,759
Note that these HSRP group numbers don’t
actually have to match the VLAN number.

71
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,809
Okay, next I’ll make it’s priority lower
than the default of 100.

72
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:57,879
STANDBY 20 PRIORITY 95.

73
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,819
And enable preempt.

74
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:01,310
STANDBY 20 PREEMPT.

75
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,110
Okay, that’s all here on DSW1.

76
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,870
END.

77
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,139
Now I’ll do similar configurations on DSW2.

78
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:16,849
CONF T. First, make it the secondary root
of VLAN 10.

79
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:20,669
SPANNING-TREE VLAN 10 ROOT SECONDARY.

80
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:23,520
And the primary root for VLAN 20.

81
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,189
SPANNING-TREE VLAN 20 ROOT PRIMARY.

82
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:29,909
Let’s check the STP status now.

83
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:32,520
Is it the root for VLAN 20?

84
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,389
DO SHOW SPANNING-TREE VLAN 20.

85
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:38,719
Yes it is, perfect.

86
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:42,430
And DSW1 should remain the root for VLAN 10.

87
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,360
DO SHOW SPANNING-TREE VLAN 10.

88
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:53,330
Perfect, DSW2’s root port is G1/0/3 which
is connected to DSW1.

89
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,599
Next up, HSRP on DSW2.

90
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:59,110
INTERFACE VLAN 10.

91
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,809
First let’s make the version match.

92
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:03,919
STANDBY VERSION 2.

93
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,319
And then configure the same virtual IP, the
.254 of the subnet.

94
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,080
STANDBY 10 IP 10.0.10.254.

95
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,249
And let’s lower the priority here, even
though DSW1’s is already higher.

96
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:23,029
STANDBY 10 PRIORITY 95.

97
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:25,430
And I’ll enable preemption too.

98
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,020
STANDBY 10 PREEMPT.

99
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:32,289
Okay, that’s all for VLAN 10, now VLAN 20.

100
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:35,219
INTERFACE VLAN 20.

101
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:38,319
STANDBY VERSION 2.

102
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,509
STANDBY 20 IP 10.0.20.254.

103
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:48,250
STANDBY 20 PRIORITY 105.

104
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,289
STANDBY 20 PREEMPT.

105
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:52,719
END.

106
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:55,240
All of the configurations should be good now.

107
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:01,719
Again, DSW1 should be active in VLAN 10 and
STANDBY in VLAN 20, and DSW2 should be the

108
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:03,069
opposite.

109
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:06,659
Active in VLAN 20 and standby in VLAN 10.

110
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:12,809
Let’s check first here on DSW2 if it’s
the HSRP active in VLAN 20 and standby in

111
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:14,490
VLAN 10.

112
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,089
SHOW STANDBY BRIEF.

113
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:19,300
Okay, VLAN 10 looks perfect.

114
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:26,020
The active is 10.0.10.1, which is DSW1, and
the standby is local, meaning DSW2.

115
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,509
VLAN 20 looks good too.

116
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:32,699
The active is local and standby is 10.0.20.1,
DSW1.

117
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:41,179
So it all looks good here on DSW2, but let’s
check on DSW1 also just to be sure.

118
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:42,869
SHOW STANDBY BRIEF.

119
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:51,749
Okay, in VLAN 10 the active is local and DSW2
is standby, and the opposite for VLAN 20.

120
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:57,499
So, we have configured both STP and HSRP as
in the instructions.

121
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:03,509
This ensures that hosts in VLAN 10 have a
direct path to their default gateway, DSW1,

122
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:09,029
and hosts in VLAN 20 have a direct path to
their default gateway, DSW2.

123
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:15,300
Synchronizing the STP and HSRP configurations
like this is a good LAN design principle.

124
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,919
Although to be honest I doubt you’ll be
asked about it on the CCNA exam, in this course

125
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,179
I always try to give you more information
than you need, as long as it’s valuable.

126
00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:26,729
Okay, that’s all for this lab.

127
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:35,750
Now let’s take a look at a lab in Boson
Software’s NetSim for CCNA.
