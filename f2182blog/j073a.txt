6
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:16,970
Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,279
Also, remember to sign up via the link in
the description to get all of the lab files

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,039
for this course, so you can try it out yourself
in packet tracer.

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,320
If you want more labs like these, I highly
recommend picking up Boson’s NetSim for

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,219
the CCNA, click the link in the video description
to check it out.

11
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:38,960
It’s a network simulator like packet tracer,
but it’s even better, and it includes all

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,030
of these guided labs to not only help you
get hands-on practice configuring and troubleshooting,

13
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,470
but also deepen your understanding of the
exam topics.

14
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:52,469
I used it myself when studying for my certifications,
so I feel confident about recommending it

15
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,969
to all of you.

16
00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:00,260
If you want to get your own copy of NetSim,
please follow the link in the video description.

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,110
In this lab we will configure DNS, Domain
Name System.

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:10,560
DNS is used to translate easy-to-remember
names like youtube.com to IP addresses.

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:18,100
We’ll configure R1 and these three PCs to
use 1.1.1.1 as their DNS server.

20
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:24,130
Unfortunately, the IP DNS SERVER command isn’t
available in Packet Tracer, so we can’t

21
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,390
configure R1 to act as a DNS server for the
internal hosts.

22
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:34,330
By the way, 1.1.1.1 is an actual DNS server
provided by Cloudflare.

23
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:40,310
In the lecture video I used 8.8.8.8, Google’s
DNS server, but I wanted to introduce another

24
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,830
public DNS provider.

25
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,181
Of course, this is Packet Tracer, so this
server isn’t a real server, but you can

26
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:54,140
configure 1.1.1.1 as the DNS server on your
PC if you want to actually use Cloudflare’s

27
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,210
DNS server.

28
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,750
Anyway let’s get started.

29
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,640
In step 1 we will configure a default route
to the Internet on R1.

30
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,750
I thought about pre-configuring this, but
it’s good to review the basics sometimes.

31
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,500
So let’s go on R1.

32
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,420
ENABLE.

33
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,370
CONF T. And now I’ll configure the route.

34
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:21,989
IP ROUTE 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0, and then the next
hop is 203.0.113.2.

35
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:28,980
Let me point out that this INTERNET cloud
is just a router, I just changed the icon.

36
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,060
In the lab for day 1 of this course I did
the same thing and I’ve gotten hundreds

37
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,540
of questions about how to add the Internet
cloud, so I just wanted to point that out.

38
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,719
Now let me check that this default route is
working.

39
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:49,549
I’ll try to ping the Cloudflare DNS server
at 1.1.1.1 DO PING 1.1.1.1.

40
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:54,620
ARP can be slow in packet tracer so one or
two pings might fail, but then R1 gets the

41
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,819
response from the server.

42
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:06,719
Okay now in step 2 I’ll configure PC1, PC2,
and PC3 to use 1.1.1.1 as their DNS server.

43
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,879
First I’ll go on PC1.

44
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:15,540
From the config tab, you can configure the
DNS server here under the default gateway.

45
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,540
1.1.1.1.

46
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,250
Okay, that’s it.

47
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,010
Now I’ll do the same on PC2.

48
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:28,049
From the config tab, set the DNS server to
1.1.1.1.

49
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:32,510
In the lecture video I mentioned that DHCP
can be used to automatically learn things

50
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:37,299
like the hosts IP address, default gateway,
and DNS server.

51
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:41,450
Notice here in packet tracer you can select
either DHCP or static.

52
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:47,040
We’ll use static for now, but I’ll cover
DHCP soon in the course, maybe even the next

53
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,610
video.

54
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,079
Okay next PC3.

55
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:57,849
From the config tab, set the DNS server to
1.1.1.1.

56
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:01,180
Next in step 3 we’ll configure R1’s DNS
server.

57
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:08,690
We’ll also configure a host table on R1
for hosts in the local network, 192.168.0.0/24,

58
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,329
so R1 will be able to ping them by name.

59
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:14,340
I’ll return to R1.

60
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,890
And let’s configure it to use 1.1.1.1 as
well.

61
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,820
IP NAME-SERVER 1.1.1.1.

62
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,950
Then a host entry for R1 itself.

63
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:32,420
IP HOST R1 192.168.0.254.

64
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,710
Then for each PC, PC1 first.

65
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:41,400
IP HOST PC1 192.168.0.1.

66
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,690
Then PC2.

67
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,620
IP HOST PC2 192.168.0.2.

68
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,040
And then PC3.

69
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,230
IP HOST PC3 192.168.0.3.

70
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,500
Okay, that’s R1’s host table.

71
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,310
I’ll check the host table with DO SHOW HOSTS.

72
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,890
And there are the hosts we configured.

73
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,910
I’ll try a ping to PC1 by name.

74
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,540
DO PING PC1.

75
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,370
And the ping is successful.

76
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:19,260
R1 has an entry in its host table for PC1,
so it is able to translate the name PC1 to

77
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,870
192.168.0.1.

78
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,410
Note that the IP DOMAIN LOOKUP command must
be enabled for R1 to do this, but it’s enabled

79
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:32,960
by default so usually you don’t need to
configure it.

80
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,680
Finally in step 4 we will use Packet Tracer’s
simulation mode to see the various messages

81
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,870
that are sent when when PC1 pings youtube.com
by name.

82
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,910
Simulation mode is enabled here in the bottom
right.

83
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:51,770
Now I’ll go to PC1 and let’s do that ping.

84
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,270
PING youtube.com.

85
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,020
Okay, so there is a DNS query message here.

86
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:04,130
Because R1 already pinged PC1, PC1 knows the
MAC address of its default gateway R1, so

87
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,400
PC1 doesn’t need to send an ARP request.

88
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:14,960
The DNS message goes to R1, to the Internet,
and to 1.1.1.1, before being sent back.

89
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,590
Note that no ARP messages are needed here
either.

90
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:24,500
R1 already pinged 1.1.1.1 before, so the ARP
process is already complete.

91
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:32,110
Now that 1.1.1.1’s DNS response is back
at PC1, let’s see the contents.

92
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:38,350
From the ‘inbound PDU details’ tab, scroll
down to the bottom and you can see the answer.

93
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:44,630
Youtube.com’s IP address is 172.217.6.78.

94
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,160
Notice PC1 has now created the ICMP message,
the ping.

95
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:58,140
If I click on it, you can see that the destination
IP is 172.217.6.78, the IP address of youtube.com.

96
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,710
The message goes to R1 and the Internet, but
now the Internet router has to send an ARP

97
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:07,240
message to youtube.com, because I haven’t
sent any traffic between them yet in this

98
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,220
lab.

99
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:14,450
During that time PC1’s first ping fails,
but then it sends another ping and it reaches

100
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,380
youtube.com, and youtube.com replies.

101
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,210
Okay, I’ll return to realtime mode now.

102
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,910
If I go back to PC1, notice that the first
ping failed, but the next three succeeded,

103
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:31,180
because the ARP process in Packet Tracer is
a bit slow.

104
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,040
Simulation mode in Packet Tracer is a great
tool to understand how traffic flows through

105
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,670
a network.

106
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:42,140
For PC1 to ping youtube.com, ICMP messages
weren’t the only messages sent.

107
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,020
DNS and ARP messages were needed too.

108
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,920
There’s not much you need to know about
DNS in terms of configuration, but make sure

109
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,230
you understand its basic purpose and operations.

110
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,510
Okay, that’s all for this lab.

111
00:07:54,510 --> 00:08:00,680
Now let’s take a look at a lab in Boson
Software’s NetSim for CCNA.

112
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,470
Okay here's today's Boson NetSim lab preview.

113
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,310
The lab I have selected for today is Configuring
DNS 1.

114
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,930
Boson NetSim for CCNA has four DNS labs here.

115
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:17,280
Configuring DNS 1 and 2, and then Troubleshooting
DNS 1 and 2.

116
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,230
So I've selected the first one.

117
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:24,180
It has a pretty simple topology, one router,
one switch and two PCs.

118
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,340
Here are the commands you need to know.

119
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,000
Some of these we covered in the lecture video.

120
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,009
And some of these are NetSim specific commands,
such as these ones here.

121
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:41,759
IPCONFIG /DG to configure the default gateway,
/IP to configure the IP address, and /DNS

122
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:48,790
to configure the DNS server on a PC in NetSim.

123
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,249
Okay here are the lab tasks.

124
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:57,860
There are four tasks but for this little preview
we'll just do task 1 and task 2.

125
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:04,199
So let's get started with task 1, which involves
configuring IP addresses on these devices.

126
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:06,749
So first step 1.

127
00:09:06,749 --> 00:09:12,639
On Router1 configure the host name, enable
the interface, and assign the appropriate

128
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,889
IP address, okay.

129
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,160
So here's Router1.

130
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,140
I'll configure the host name.

131
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,980
HOSTNAME Router1.

132
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,850
And then here's the interface.

133
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,410
INTERFACE F0/0.

134
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:34,889
It's 10.0.0.1 /24.

135
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:39,040
And I'll enable that.

136
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,480
Okay I think that's it on R1.

137
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:50,339
Next I'll go on to Switch1 and do the same.

138
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,740
Okay now I'm going to configure an IP address
on Switch1.

139
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,709
This might be a new concept for you.

140
00:09:55,709 --> 00:10:00,800
Switch1 is a Layer2 switch but I'm going to
configure an IP address on it.

141
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,630
So, I will cover this in more detail when
we cover SSH and Telnet in a later video,

142
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:13,040
but Layer2 switches can have an IP address
which you can use to connect to it to configure

143
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,279
the switch, so you don't actually have to
physically be next to the switch with a console

144
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,279
cable.

145
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:21,129
Anyway, I'll talk about that in a later video.

146
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:27,509
So let's configure that IP address on the
VLAN1 SVI, switch virtual interface.

147
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:34,889
The IP address is 10.0.0.2 /24.

148
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:40,782
And it should be enabled by default but I'll
NO SHUT it just incase.

149
00:10:40,782 --> 00:10:48,470
Okay next, on the PCs, configure the appropriate
IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.

150
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,149
Okay so now I'm going to use those NetSim-specific
commands I showed you.

151
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:55,440
First here on PC1.

152
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,540
IPCONFIG /IP to set the IP address.

153
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,779
10.0.0.100, as it shows here.

154
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:08,189
/24.

155
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:16,500
And then to configure the default gateway
its IPCONFIG /DG 10.0.0.1.

156
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,170
And then I'll do the same on PC2.

157
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:28,006
IPCONFIG /IP 10.0.0.101 /24.

158
00:11:28,006 --> 00:11:36,930
IPCONFIG /DG 10.0.0.1, okay.

159
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:43,860
Next up, verify the IP address and subnet
mask on Router1 and Switch1.

160
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,360
Okay, DO SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.

161
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:55,339
Okay, on FastEthernet0/0, 10.0.0.1 and it's
UP and UP.

162
00:11:55,339 --> 00:12:00,279
Now it says verify the IP address and subnet
mask, but you can't actually view the subnet

163
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:03,569
mask using SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.

164
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:11,589
So DO SHOW IP INTERFACE F0/0 will show us
that.

165
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:15,529
There it is, /24.

166
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:17,940
Okay and I'll do the same on Switch1.

167
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,584
DO SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF.

168
00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:26,300
VLAN1, 10.0.0.2, UP UP.

169
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:34,009
But we can't see the subnet mask so I'll use DO
SHOW IP INTERFACE, without the brief, VLAN 1.

170
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:38,249
Okay, /24.

171
00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:43,759
Okay so we have verified the IP address and subnet
masks on Router1 and Switch1.

172
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:52,110
Finally, in step 5 we have to verify network
connectivity by pinging to Switch1, PC1, and

173
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,380
PC2 from Router1.

174
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,889
Okay so let's do that.

175
00:12:56,889 --> 00:13:02,290
PING 10.0.0.2, that's Switch1, looks good.

176
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,420
.100 is PC1, okay.

177
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,300
And .101, PC2, great.

178
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,129
Okay so that's task 1.

179
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:19,360
We performed the initial configurations of
host names and IP addresses and tested connectivity.

180
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,899
Task 2 is to configure DNS.

181
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:30,730
Okay from Switch1 ping Router1 by using the
host name Router1 instead of Router1's IP address.

182
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,519
Does the ping succeed or fail, and why?

183
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:41,339
So, Switch1 doesn't have any DNS configurations
yet so this should fail, let's see.

184
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,399
PING Router1.

185
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:45,570
And yes, unrecognized host or address.

186
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:51,940
So Switch1 was unable to translate the host
name Router1 to an IP address.

187
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:58,772
Okay, and then step 2, on Router1 enable the
DNS feature.

188
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:01,420
Sorry, the DNS server feature, that's important.

189
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,019
So IP DNS SERVER.

190
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:09,430
So now Router1 will respond to DNS queries
if it has the appropriate entry.

191
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,410
And let's configure those entries here in
step 3.

192
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:17,810
Configure Router1 with two host table entries,
Router1 and Switch1.

193
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:26,339
Okay the command is IP HOST, 10.0., or sorry
IP HOST, the hostname's first, and then the

194
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:31,720
IP address., 10.0.0.1.

195
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,420
And then for Switch1.

196
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:42,769
Okay configure Switch1 to use Router1 as its
DNS server and enable hostname-to-address

197
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:44,059
translation.

198
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:52,130
Okay, so to make Router1 its DNS server the
command is IP NAME-SERVER and then the IP

199
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,970
address.

200
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:02,439
And to enable hostname-to-address translation,
that is this command: IP DOMAIN-LOOKUP.

201
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:04,740
Notice it's using the old version, with a
hyphen.

202
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:13,040
So, this command should be enabled by default,
but it told us to enable it again anyway.

203
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,350
Okay and then finally step 5.

204
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:20,340
From Switch1 ping Router1 by using the name
of the host instead of Router1's IP address

205
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,029
to verify your configuration.

206
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:26,010
So let's try that ping again and it should
work this time.

207
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,720
PING Router1.

208
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:37,199
Okay, it says 'translating Router1' using
domain server 10.0.0.1, which is Router1.

209
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:44,449
And then it translates it to 10.0.0.1 and
the pings succeed.

210
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:49,930
Okay then if we were to go on to task 3 and
4, here we would edit a PC hosts file, remember

211
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:55,550
I showed you in the lecture video what a PC
hosts file is.

212
00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:01,239
And then we would configure DNS on PC1 and
PC2.

213
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:04,730
Okay so that's a quick look at Boson NetSim
for CCNA.

214
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:10,439
Boson NetSim has over 100 detailed labs like
this, with a powerful network simulator.

215
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:13,949
So it's a really fantastic study tool for
the CCNA.
