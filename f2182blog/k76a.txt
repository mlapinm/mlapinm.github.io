studying for the CCNA in this lab we

will troubleshoot a few problems in the

network we configured in the previous

lab there are three issues listed in the

instructions

let's fix them one by one the first

issue is that PC 2 cannot ping PC 1

let's test it I'll ping PC 1 from PC to

ping 192.168.1.1 hundred ok we get a

reply from our default gateway saying

the destination host is unreachable this

probably means the default gateway R 2

doesn't have a route to the network

let's investigate on our to enable show

IP route indeed our two only knows local

and connected routes it's missing the

default route out to the Internet we

configured in the previous lab let's fix

that

comte IP route

oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh g 0 0 0 ok

immediately we get a message saying our

tunnel interface is up because we now

have a route to the destination and if

we wait a few seconds the OSPF neighbor

r1 should come up as well let's try that

ping from PC to again ping 192.168.1.1

hundred

okay the ping works this time we've

solved the first issue the next problem

is that PC for cannot pain pc3 let's

test that out I'll ping pc 3 from PC for

ping 192.168 3.1 hundred ok the thing

fails this time our default gateway

doesn't send destination host

unreachable so it's probably a different

issue

let's check out our for enable show IP

route as you can see our 4 has a default

route so it should be able to reach the

1 and 2.16 8.30 slash 24 network which

is connected to our 3 let's check out

our 3 enable show IP route ok our 3 only

has connected and local roads no AI GRP

or even BGP routes this means that the

ping from pc 4 was able to reach pc 3

but our 3 couldn't send the reply back

because it doesn't have a route to

192.168.0 slash 24 the lack of BGP

routes isn't relevant to this current

issue so let's look at the EA grpe issue

show IP erp neighbors no neighbors

that's a problem show IP protocols can

you identify the issue under routing for

networks 203 OD 1 1 3 8 / 30 is listed

which is fine 192.168.0 is listed which

is fine it's a class full / 24 network

so the prefix length isn't displayed but

192.168.0 / 32 is incorrect

r 3 doesn't have any interface in

192.168.0 / 32 Network its G 0 1

interface is 192.168.0.1 let's fix that

statement coffee tea red ER e IG RP 100

no network 192.168.0 oh-oh-oh-oh network

192.168.0.0 oh-oh-oh 255 ok immediately

the adjacency comes up do show IP route

okay

now R 3 has a route to 192.168.0 / 24

let's try that ping again from pc 4 in

192.168 3.1 hundred ok the ping works

this time now the last problem is that

hosts in enterprise B cannot ping hosts

in enterprise a that probably has to do

with the fact that our 3 still has no

BGP routes let's go back on our three to

investigate and show IP BGP summary ok

so two of 302 139 in a s 65 thousand one

is configured as our neighbor that's

correct

show IP bgp neighbors ok here at the top

it says BGP state equals active that

sounds like a good thing but really it

means that BGP is actively trying to

form an adjacency the state we really

want is established the BGP

configuration looks fine however so

maybe there is something wrong with the

interface show interface s 0 0 0

encapsulation hdl-c

there's a problem

it's supposed to be using PPP as we

configured in the last lab show run

indeed PPP isn't configured on the

interface if I scroll up a little

however you can see the appropriate

username and password combination is

configured so we just have to configure

the encapsulation and authentication

mode coffee/tea interface s 0 0 0

shutdown encapsulation PPP PPP

authentication chap no shutdown okay

let's wait 10 seconds or so for the BGP

adjacency to come up

okay now let's check the route table do

show IP route okay now we have all of

those BGP routes let's try a ping from

PC for two PC one ping 192.168.1.1

hundred

okay the ping works we've solved the

network issues that's all for this lab
