Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:26,859
In this video we will cover two Cisco proprietary
protocols, DTP, aka dynamic trunking protocol,

8
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:31,380
and VTP, VLAN trunking protocol.

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,250
As I said, they are Cisco proprietary, meaning
they were developed by Cisco and they only

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,890
run on Cisco devices.

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:45,600
DTP and VTP were removed from the CCNA exam
topics list for the new exam (200-301).

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,990
However, it’s important to know their function,
and you may still get questions about them

13
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,780
on the exam even though they are not on the
topics list.

14
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,270
So, what will we cover in this video?

15
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,899
Well, I already said it.

16
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:02,960
We will cover DTP, dynamic trunking protocol,
first.

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,220
DTP is a Cisco proprietary protocol that allows
switches to negotiate the status of their

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:15,360
switchports to be either access ports or trunk
ports, without manually configuring them.

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,040
Then we will cover VTP, VLAN trunking protocol.

20
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,079
VTP is another Cisco proprietary protocol
that allows you to configure VLANs on a central

21
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,340
switch, which then acts as a server that other
switches can synchronize to, so you don’t

22
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,180
have to configure VLANs on every single switch
in the network.

23
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:39,380
Also, make sure you watch until the end of
today’s quiz, as I will once again feature

24
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:44,439
a question from ExSim for CCNA, by Boson Software.

25
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:49,979
ExSim for CCNA is Boson’s set of practice
exams for the CCNA, and they are widely regarded

26
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,070
as the best practice exams to get you ready
for the real thing.

27
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,990
I used them myself for my CCNA and CCNP.

28
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,609
If you want to get a copy of ExSim, follow
the link in the video description.

29
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:06,290
Let’s go over some points about DTP.

30
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:12,670
DTP is a Cisco proprietary protocol that allows
Cisco switches to dynamically determine their

31
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,340
interface status (access or trunk) without
manual configuration.

32
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,690
Basically, two Cisco switches connected together
can form a trunk, but otherwise the interface

33
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,240
will automatically be an access port.

34
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,530
DTP is enabled by default on all Cisco switch
interfaces.

35
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,620
Once again, because it is a proprietary protocol,
this applies only to Cisco switches.

36
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,090
So far, we have been manually configuring
switchports using either SWITCHPORT MODE ACCESS

37
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,680
or SWITCHPORT MODE TRUNK.

38
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,310
If we use DTP, we don’t need to enter these
commands.

39
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,300
Now, for security purposes, manual configuration
is recommended.

40
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,730
DTP should be disabled on all switchports.

41
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:03,310
DTP can be exploited by attackers, and I’ll
talk more about network security later in

42
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:08,330
this course, but for now just know that it
should be disabled on all interfaces.

43
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,050
Let’s go straight into the CLI.

44
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:17,170
I’m in interface configuration mode here
on a Cisco switch, and I entered SWITCHPORT

45
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,840
MODE, followed by the question mark.

46
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,260
You can see the ACCESS and TRUNK options we
used before, but the one we’re going to

47
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,709
look at now is this one, DYNAMIC.

48
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,519
It says ‘set trunking mode to dynamically
negotiate access or trunk mode’.

49
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,920
That’s DTP.

50
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,700
So, I entered DYNAMIC and used the question
mark again.

51
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,870
There are two options, AUTO and DESIRABLE.

52
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,730
The only description given is ‘Set trunking
mode dynamic negotiation parameter to AUTO

53
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,090
or DESIRABLE’, which doesn’t really explain
their function.

54
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,049
So, let me explain each of these modes.

55
00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:01,180
A switchport in DYNAMIC DESIRABLE mode will
actively try to form a trunk with other Cisco

56
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,409
switches.

57
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:07,209
It will form a trunk if connected to another
switchport in the following modes: switchport

58
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:09,220
mode trunk.

59
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,550
switchport mode dynamic desirable, or switchport
mode dynamic auto.

60
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,070
Let’s see how that works.

61
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:22,120
SW1 and SW2 are connected via their G0/0 interfaces.

62
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,700
SW1’s G0/0 interface is in DYNAMIC DESIRABLE
MODE.

63
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,010
SW2’s G0/0 interface is manually configured
as a trunk.

64
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:35,610
So, these two switches will both agree to
operate as trunks.

65
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:40,840
Here is a new command, SHOW INTERFACES G0/0
SWITCHPORT.

66
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,380
These are just the first few lines of output,
I will show you the others later.

67
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,650
It says switchport: enabled, because it is
a layer 2 port.

68
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,970
If we want to configure a routed port with
the ‘no switchport’ command, this would

69
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,370
display differently.

70
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,440
The administrative mode is dynamic desirable.

71
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,280
Administrative mode is what we actually configured
on the interface, and then below it, operational

72
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,470
mode, displays whether it is a trunk or access
port.

73
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,570
Because SW2’s interface is a trunk, SW1’s
interface became a trunk as well, thanks to

74
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,220
DTP negotiation.

75
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:25,080
Here on SW2 you can see that both the administrative
mode AND operational mode are trunk.

76
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,560
Now both interfaces are configured in dynamic
desirable mode.

77
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,450
So, they will both form a trunk.

78
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:37,120
The output of SHOW INTERFACES SWITCHPORT is
the same on SW1, and this time SW2 also has

79
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,890
an administrative mode of ‘dynamic desirable’,
but once again the operational mode is trunk,

80
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:48,020
because both switches are actively using DTP
to try to form a trunk.

81
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,280
Even if manually configured as a trunk, an
interface still sends DTP frames out of the

82
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,520
interface.

83
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,510
This time SW2’s interface is configured
in dynamic auto mode.

84
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,090
A switchport in dynamic auto mode does not
actively try to form a trunk.

85
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,860
It’s more passive.

86
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,571
It will tell SW1 ‘if you want to form a
trunk, I’ll form a trunk, but I’m not

87
00:06:09,571 --> 00:06:12,460
going to actively try to form a trunk with
you.’

88
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:18,150
However, because SW1 is in dynamic desirable
mode, once again a trunk will be formed.

89
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:24,160
SW1’s SHOW INTERFACES SWITCHPORT output
is the same, and SW2’s shows an administrative

90
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,790
mode of dynamic auto, and again an operational
mode of trunk.

91
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,920
One more example: SW2’s interface is now
manually configured as an access port with

92
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,830
the SWITCHPORT MODE ACCESS command.

93
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:43,250
SW1 is actively trying to form a trunk, but
since SW2 is manually configured in access

94
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:48,680
mode, the trunk will not form, and both will
operate as access ports in the default VLAN,

95
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,380
which is VLAN 1.

96
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:57,050
The output of SHOW INTERFACES SWITCHPORT on
SW1 now shows an operational mode of static

97
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,110
access.

98
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,360
What does ‘static access’ mean?

99
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,121
‘static access’ means an access port that
belongs to a single VLAN that doesn’t change

100
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:08,580
(unless you configure a different VLAN).

101
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,400
There are also ‘dynamic access’ ports,
in which a server automatically assigns the

102
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,020
VLAN depending on the MAC address of the connected
device.

103
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,240
But this is out of the scope of the CCNA, you
don’t need to learn about dynamic access

104
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,390
ports, I just wanted to clarify what ‘static
access’ means.

105
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:32,660
Now, on SW2’s g0/0 interface both the administrative
and operational modes are static access.

106
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:38,081
Okay, now you’ve learned about dynamic desirable
mode and seen that an interface in dynamic

107
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:43,500
desirable mode will use DTP negotiation to
form a trunk if the connected interface on

108
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,810
the other device is in trunk, dynamic desirable,
or dynamic auto mode.

109
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:54,080
However, if the other interface is in access
mode, it will not form a trunk, it will be

110
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,130
an access port.

111
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:59,060
Now let’s look at dynamic auto mode.

112
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:04,160
A switchport in dynamic auto mode will NOT
actively try to form a trunk with other Cisco

113
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,100
switches, however it will form a trunk if
the switch connected to it is actively trying

114
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,010
to form a trunk.

115
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:16,020
It will form a trunk with a switchport in
the following modes: switchport mode trunk,

116
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,290
or switchport mode dynamic desirable.

117
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:26,710
So, SW1’s G0/0 interface is configured in
dynamic auto mode, and SW2’s is manually

118
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,160
configured as a trunk.

119
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,690
Therefore, DTP negotiation will cause them
to form a trunk link.

120
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:38,180
Here you can see the administrative mode of
dynamic auto and operational mode of trunk,

121
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,630
whereas on SW2 both are trunk.

122
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:47,650
Now, we already saw what happens when a switchport
in dynamic auto mode is connected to a switchport

123
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,310
in dynamic desirable mode, they form a trunk.

124
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,080
So, let’s look at two switchports in dynamic
auto mode.

125
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,190
Neither is actively trying to form a trunk,
so both operate as access ports in the default

126
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,060
VLAN, VLAN1.

127
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:06,180
And they have the same output for the SHOW
INTERFACES SWITCHPORT command, administrative

128
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:11,710
mode of dynamic auto and operational mode
of static access.

129
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,450
Next up, dynamic auto and access mode.

130
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:21,160
As you can probably guess, this will result
in both interfaces operating as access ports.

131
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,590
Here is the output of SHOW INTERFACES SWITCHPORT
on each switch.

132
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:32,030
Now, you may wonder what happens if a manually
configured trunk is connected to a manually

133
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,410
configured access port?

134
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:38,920
Well, since both are manually configured,
they are forced to operate mismatched in trunk

135
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,140
and access modes.

136
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,860
Here is the output of SHOW INTERFACES SWITCHPORT
for each.

137
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,830
However, this configuration does not work,
it should result in an error, and traffic

138
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,180
will not pass between these switches.

139
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:57,300
Here’s a chart summarizing the resulting
operational mode given two administrative

140
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,710
modes.

141
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:03,370
For example, a switchport in dynamic desirable
mode will form a trunk with an interface in

142
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,700
any administrative mode except access.

143
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,330
Pause the video here if you want to take a
look at this table.

144
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,440
Now, one more important point.

145
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,220
DTP will not form a trunk with a router, PC,
etc.

146
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,990
The switchport will be in access mode.

147
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:25,710
So, if you want to configure router on a stick,
you must manually configure the interface

148
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:30,820
connected to the router as a trunk, you cannot
put it in dynamic desirable mode and expect

149
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,890
it to become a trunk.

150
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,190
Let me cover a few more points about DTP.

151
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:43,510
On older switches, switchport mode dynamic
desirable is the default administrative mode.

152
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,060
They will actively try to form trunk links.

153
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:51,750
However, on newer switchers, switchport mode
dynamic auto is the default administrative

154
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,230
mode.

155
00:10:53,230 --> 00:11:00,270
You can disable DTP negotiation on an interface
with this command: switchport nonegotiate.

156
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:06,030
If you use this command, the interface will
stop sending DTP negotiation frames.

157
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:12,240
By the way, configuring an access port with
switchport mode access also disables DTP negotiation

158
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,900
on an interface.

159
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,040
It will also stop sending DTP frames.

160
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,340
If you manually configure an interface in
trunk mode, however, it does not stop it from

161
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:28,010
sending DTP frames, unless you also issue
the SWITCHPORT NONEGOTIATE command above.

162
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:33,760
As I said before, it is recommended that you
disable DTP on all switchports and manually

163
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,760
configure them as access or trunk ports.

164
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,320
Now let me talk about trunk encapsulation negotiation.

165
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,340
Switches that support both dot1q and ISL trunk
encapsulations can use DTP to negotiate the

166
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,060
encapsulation they will use.

167
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,841
This negotiation is enabled by default, as
the default trunk encapsulation mode is: switchport

168
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,130
trunk encapsulation negotiate.

169
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:03,250
I mentioned this in a previous video on VLANs.

170
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,990
If you want to manually configure a trunk
interface on a switch that supports both dot1q

171
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:14,300
and ISL, you must first change the encapsulation
mode to dot1q or ISL, you can’t leave it

172
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,010
in negotiate mode.

173
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:23,550
ISL is favored over dot1q, so if both switches
support ISL it will be selected.

174
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:30,730
By the way, the DTP frames that DTP uses to
negotiate are sent in VLAN1 when using ISL,

175
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,090
or in the native VLAN when using dot1q.

176
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:39,180
The default native VLAN is VLAN1, however,
so unless you change the native VLAN they

177
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,000
will be sent in VLAN1 for dot1q also.

178
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,200
To show you this negotiation of trunking encapsulation,
here is a little more of the output from SHOW

179
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,930
INTERFACES SWITCHPORT.

180
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:58,230
I set the interfaces on both switches to dynamic
desirable mode so they would form a trunk.

181
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:02,960
Notice that the default trunking encapsulation
mode of negotiate results in an operational

182
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,270
trunking encapsulation of ISL.

183
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:12,130
By the way, this field down here, negotiation
of trunking, shows whether DTP is enabled,

184
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,270
whether the interface is sending DTP frames
or not.

185
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:21,950
If the interface is in dynamic desirable,
dynamic auto, or trunk mode, this will be

186
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,170
on.

187
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,920
If it’s in access mode, or if you use the
switchport nonegotiate command I showed you

188
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,930
before, this will be off.

189
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:35,360
Okay, that was a good deal of information
about DTP.

190
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,741
I’m quite sure that you won’t need any
more information than that for the CCNA when

191
00:13:39,741 --> 00:13:42,610
it comes to DTP.

192
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:47,540
If you need extra review, watch the section
again, try out the configurations in packet

193
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,900
tracer yourself, and then try my packet tracer
practice lab which will be in the next video.

194
00:13:52,900 --> 00:14:00,490
Next, let’s move on to today’s second
topic, VTP, VLAN Trunking Protocol.

195
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:06,760
VTP allows you to configure VLANs on a central server switch, and other switches (called

196
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:12,030
VTP clients) will synchronize their VLAN database
to the server.

197
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,690
It is designed for large networks with many
VLANs, so that you don’t have to configure

198
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,440
each VLAN on every single switch.

199
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:26,200
However, like DTP it is rarely used, and it
is recommended that you do not use it.

200
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,910
I will show you one reason why it is recommended
that you do not use it later.

201
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,529
There are three versions of VTP, 1, 2 and
3.

202
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:40,690
Most modern Cisco switches support all three,
but older switches might only support 1 and

203
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,100
2.

204
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,160
I will talk about some differences in each
version as we go.

205
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:54,030
There are three VTP modes that a switch can
operate in: server, client, and transparent.

206
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,980
Cisco switches operate in VTP server mode
by default.

207
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,350
Let’s talk about the different VTP modes.

208
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:09,040
First up, VTP servers.  They can add, modify, and
delete VLANs.

209
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,600
As I said, Cisco switches operate in VTP server
mode by default, so you can modify the VLAN

210
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,050
database on Cisco switches by default.

211
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:24,250
They store the VLAN database in non-volatile
RAM, also called NVRAM.

212
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,580
This means the VLAN database is saved even
if the switch is turned off or reloaded.

213
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:37,790
VTP servers will increase the REVISION NUMBER
every time a VLAN is added, modified, or deleted.

214
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,820
This revision number is a very important part
of VTP.

215
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:46,680
It’s what VTP uses to determine the newest
version of the VLAN database, the version

216
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,250
that the switches will synchronize to.

217
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:55,710
VTP servers will advertise the latest version
of the VLAN database on trunk interfaces and

218
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:59,860
the VTP clients will synchronize their VLAN
database to it.

219
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,920
So, VTP advertisements aren’t sent on access
ports, only on trunk ports.

220
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:13,070
Here’s another important point: VTP servers
also function as VTP clients.

221
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,540
What does that mean?

222
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,630
It means that a VTP server will synchronize
to another VTP server with a higher revision

223
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:24,670
number, because the highest revision number
is considered the newest, most accurate version

224
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,380
of the VLAN database.

225
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,120
Now let’s talk about VTP clients a little.

226
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,390
VTP clients cannot add, modify, or delete
VLANs.

227
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:41,320
If you try to add, modify, or delete a VLAN
in the CLI, the command will be rejected.

228
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:48,430
VTP clients do not store the VLAN database
in NVRAM, however in the newest VTP version,

229
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,970
VTPv3, they do.

230
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:56,029
VTP clients will synchronize their VLAN database
to the server with the highest revision number

231
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:58,080
in their VTP domain.

232
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,470
I will talk about VTP domains soon.

233
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:07,280
Finally, VTP clients will advertise their
VLAN database, and forward VLAN advertisements

234
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,760
to other clients over their trunk ports.

235
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,790
Okay, that’s enough information for now.

236
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:19,160
I will talk about the third VTP mode, VTP
transparent, later.

237
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,670
So let’s look at how VTP works.

238
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:26,370
These are four switches, and I’ve configured
all of their interfaces as trunks, so they

239
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:31,160
will send and receive VTP advertisements between
each other.

240
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:37,510
Here is the output of a very useful command,
SHOW VTP STATUS, on SW1.

241
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:42,690
All of these switches have the default configuration,
so their output will be mostly the same.

242
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,400
Let’s look at some of these fields.

243
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,100
These fields here shows that the switch is
capable of running VTP version 1, 2, or 3,

244
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,450
but it is running version 1 at the moment,
the default.

245
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,130
Notice that there is no domain name.

246
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,470
By default the domain name is NULL, there
is no domain name.

247
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,680
If we want VTP to synchronize among these
devices, we will need to configure them all

248
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,960
with the same VTP domain name.

249
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,330
Now look down here.

250
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:16,890
You can see the default VTP operating mode
of server.

251
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,810
Notice the maximum number of VLANs supported
locally is 1005.

252
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:27,400
This is because VTP version 1 and version
2 do not support the extended VLAN range of

253
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,330
1006 to 4094.

254
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:35,309
Only version 3 supports them, so if you want
to use the extended VLAN range you’ll need

255
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:38,420
to use VTP version 3.

256
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:44,190
The number of existing VLANs is 5, those are
the VLANs that exist by default on the switch,

257
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,000
1 and 1002,3,4,and 5.

258
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,910
Finally, look at the configuration reivision
number.

259
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,710
It is 0 at the moment.

260
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:59,700
If I add, modify, or delete a VLAN this will
increase to 1, and SW1 will advertise this

261
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,800
to VTP clients in the same domain.

262
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,480
It will also update its own VLAN database
if it receives a VTP advertisement with a higher

263
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,530
revision number, because VTP servers function
as VTP clients also.

264
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:20,720
So, I used the command VTP DOMAIN CISCO to
change SW1’s VTP domain name to cisco.

265
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,010
I then made a vlan, VLAN10, and named it engineering.

266
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:32,771
So, because I added a VLAN, if I do SHOW VTP
STATUS again, we should see that the revision

267
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,420
number has increased.

268
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:40,770
You can now see that the VTP domain name has
changed to Cisco, the number of existing VLANs

269
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,350
is 6, and the revision number has increased
to 1.

270
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,540
Now let’s go check on the other switches.

271
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,260
Okay, so something interesting has occurred.

272
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:57,030
Without any configuration, SW2 has changed
its domain name to cisco and updated its VLAN

273
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:02,240
database to match SW1’s, with a revision
number of 1.

274
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,821
If a switch with no VTP domain (or domain NULL)
receives a VTP advertisement with a VTP domain

275
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:12,830
name, it will automatically join that VTP
domain.

276
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:17,730
So, SW2 automatically joined the domain cisco.

277
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:23,250
As I said before, If a switch receives a VTP
advertisement in the same VTP domain with

278
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:28,650
a higher revision number, it will update its
VLAN database to match.

279
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:35,790
If I do SHOW VLAN BRIEF on SW2 now, you can
see that VLAN10, with the name ‘engineering’,

280
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,540
was added.

281
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:43,791
Here you can see that the advertisements were
passed along to SW3 and SW4 as well, and they

282
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,220
joined the domain and updated their VLAN database
as well.

283
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:54,670
Since you’ve seen how VTP sync works, let
me introduce one danger of VTP:If you connect

284
00:20:54,670 --> 00:21:00,790
an old switch with a higher revision number
to your network (and the VTP domain name matches),

285
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:05,790
all switches in the domain will sync their
VLAN database to that switch.

286
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:10,011
This could cause all of the hosts on your
network to instantly lose connectivity, because

287
00:21:10,011 --> 00:21:14,620
the switches could sync to a totally different
VTP database, and the VLANs you were using

288
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,480
could disappear.

289
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,300
This is one reason why VTP is usually not
used in modern networks.

290
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:27,420
Just to demonstrate that, let’s say this
VTP domain Cisco has a revision of

291
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:32,830
5, and VLANs 1, 10, 20, 30, and 40.

292
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:37,280
Then you take an old switch your company used
to use, to add to the network, however it

293
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,660
has a revision number of 50, and VLANS1, 99,
and 220.

294
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:47,110
It will send VTP advertisements with this
revision number, which will be forwarded throughout

295
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,890
the domain.

296
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:53,840
All of these switches will update their VLAN
database to match, and all hosts in VLANs

297
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,600
10,20,30, and 40 will suddenly lose connectivity.

298
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,450
Next let me talk about VTP transparent mode.

299
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:09,370
Switches in VTP transparent mode do not participate
in the VTP domain, they do not sync their

300
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,310
VLAN database to the VTP server.

301
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:18,370
VTP transparent mode maintains its own independent
VLAN database in NVRAM.

302
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:25,620
It can add, modify, or delete VLANs, but they won’t
be advertised to other switches.

303
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:30,390
Although it doesn’t sync its VLAN database,
it will forward VTP advertisements over its

304
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:36,041
trunk ports, if the VTP advertisement is in
the same domain as it, but it won’t advertise

305
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:39,370
its own VLAN database.

306
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:44,799
So let’s compare the functionality of server,
client, and transparent mode switches.

307
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,370
I set SW2 to client mode with the command
VTP MODE CLIENT.

308
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:56,050
Afterward, I tried to create VLAN20 on the
switch, but as you can see I was rejected,

309
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:59,549
because SW2 is now in client mode.

310
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:04,350
Then I set SW3 to transparent mode with VTP
MODE TRANSPARENT.

311
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:09,230
Also, to show you that a transparent mode
switch won’t forward advertisements if its

312
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:13,540
in a different domain, I changed the domain
name to juniper.

313
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:21,080
So, I created VLAN 20, named sales, on SW1
and you can see it appears in the output of

314
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,250
show vlan brief.

315
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:28,200
Then I did show vtp status, and you can see
that the configuration revision number is

316
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,510
4.

317
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,540
It should be 2 I think, but I made a few other
changes as I was trying things out in the

318
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,860
lab for this video.

319
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:39,580
Anyway, let’s see check out SW2.

320
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:46,710
As you can see, the VTP client SW2 has indeed
added VLAN20 to its VLAN database, and it

321
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,950
now has the same revision number, 4.

322
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:54,480
How about the transparent switch, SW3?

323
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:01,080
As expected, on the transparent switch SW3,
VLAN20 was not added, and now it has a revision

324
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,660
number of 0.

325
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:09,850
Changing the VTP domain to an unused domain
will reset the revision number to 0.

326
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:14,730
Changing the VTP mode to transparent will
also reset the revision number to 0.

327
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:19,610
So, if you’re going to plug an old switch
with a high revision number into a network

328
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:25,580
that uses VTP, make sure to reset the revision
number with one of these methods first, so

329
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,730
it doesn’t overwrite your network’s VLAN
configurations.

330
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:36,270
Now, the question is whether SW4 will have
added VLAN20 to its VLAN database.

331
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:42,530
Remember, SW3 is in transparent mode in a
different domain, so it shouldn’t forward

332
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:45,080
the VTP advertisements to SW4.

333
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:51,870
Indeed, SW4 does not have VLAN20, and it is
still on revision number 3.

334
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:58,740
So, what can we do to make SW3 start forwarding
the VTP advertisements to SW4?

335
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:04,190
If we change the VTP domain on SW3 back to
Cisco, it should start forwarding advertisements

336
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:11,610
to SW4, even though SW3 itself won’t sync
its own VLAN database based on those advertisements.

337
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:16,470
So, I changed the VTP domain on SW3 back to
cisco.

338
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:22,309
I also created some new VLANs on SW1 to increase
the revision number and send more advertisements,

339
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:28,480
by the way, and now you can see that SW3 did
indeed forward the advertisements to SW4,

340
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,510
and SW4 synced its VLAN database to SW1 and
SW2.

341
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:38,670
Finally, I’ll just talk about VTP version
a little bit.

342
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:44,030
To change the VTP version, use the VTP VERSION
command.

343
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:48,680
Changing the VTP version increases the revision
number, by the way, and advertisements with

344
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,090
this new revision number will be sent.

345
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:57,490
Other servers and clients will then sync and
start operating in version 2 as well.

346
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:03,740
For example here is SW4, it is now running
version 2 and has a revision number of 13,

347
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,140
just like SW1.

348
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:11,290
As for the difference between VTP version
1 and version 2, here is a quote directly

349
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:17,220
from Cisco: VTP V2 is not much different than
VTP V1.

350
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:24,190
The major difference is that VTP V2 introduces
support for Token Ring VLANs.

351
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:28,660
If you use Token Ring VLANs, you must enable
VTP V2.

352
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,990
Otherwise, there is no reason to use VTP V2.

353
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:38,480
Token ring is an old technology, so really
there is no reason to use version 2.

354
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,990
As for version 3, it has quite a few differences
and new features, but it’s certainly beyond

355
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:47,350
the scope of the CCNA, so we’ll leave it
here.

356
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:51,720
Okay here’s the first slide on VTP again.

357
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,669
To be honest, there is still lots more I can
talk about regarding VTP, but I will leave

358
00:26:56,669 --> 00:26:58,550
it at that for this course.

359
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:03,630
Again, it isn’t on the exam topics list,
but you may get some basic questions about

360
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:08,850
VTP and its purpose, so I wanted to tell you
about some of its functions.

361
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:13,030
If you learn and remember the information
I’ve given you in this video regarding VTP,

362
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:17,030
that should be more than enough for the CCNA
exam.

363
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:23,050
Basically, just know the purpose of VTP, the
differences between server, client, and transparent

364
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:28,210
mode, know that switches operate in server
mode by default and that servers operate as

365
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:32,300
clients too, and know about revision numbers.

366
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:37,010
If you know all of that, you should be fine.

367
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:41,539
So before moving on to today’s quiz let’s
review what we covered.

368
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:46,750
We looked at DTP first, which is a protocol
that allows Cisco switches to form trunk connections

369
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,210
with other Cisco switches, without manual
configuration.

370
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:56,500
However, it’s recommended that you disable
this protocol for security purposes.

371
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,850
Then we looked at VTP, another Cisco proprietary
protocol that allows you to configure VLANs

372
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:07,669
on switches that operate as central VTP servers,
which then advertise their VLAN database,

373
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:12,760
and VTP client switches sync their database
to it.

374
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,700
Note that VTP only syncs the VLAN database,
you still have to configure the interfaces

375
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:24,230
on each switch separately, for example SWITCHPORT
ACCESS VLAN 10, etc.

376
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:29,170
VTP does not automatically assign interfaces
to VLANs.

377
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:33,679
Both of these protocols are no longer on the
exam topics list, but you should know about

378
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,780
them and their basic functions, you may get
questions about them on the exam.

379
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:42,030
Okay let’s move on to today’s quiz.

380
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:47,720
As a bonus, I will also feature one practice
question from Boson’s ExSim for CCNA, a

381
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,240
set of practice exams I highly recommend you
get to prepare for your CCNA exam.

382
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,850
Check out ExSim via the link in the video
description.

383
00:28:55,850 --> 00:29:00,010
Okay, let’s go to question 1 of today’s
quiz.

384
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:07,160
SW1 and SW2 are connected, are both new switches,
and the connected interfaces are operating

385
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,600
as access ports.

386
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:15,400
However, SW2’s power supply fails so you
temporarily replace SW2 with an old spare

387
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,870
switch.

388
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:21,950
You reset the configuration before connecting
it to SW1, but when you connect it you notice

389
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:25,170
that a trunk is formed between the two switches.

390
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,160
What could be the cause?

391
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:32,670
A, interfaces on old switches default to switchport
mode trunk.

392
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:38,900
B, interfaces on old switches default to switchport
mode dynamic desirable.

393
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:43,570
Or C, access ports are a feature of newer
switches.

394
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:50,470
Pause the video to think about your answer.

395
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:57,330
The answer is B, interfaces on old switches
default to switchport mode dynamic desirable.

396
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,820
Newer switches default to dynamic auto.

397
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:06,400
So, in this case SW1’s interface is probably
in dynamic auto mode, and the old replacement

398
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,910
switch’s interface is probably in dynamic
desirable mode, so they would form a trunk.

399
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,860
Let’s go to question 2.

400
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:20,460
SW1 is connected to SW2, and SW2 is connected
to SW3.

401
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:26,860
You want SW2 to forward SW1’s VLAN database
information to SW3, but you don’t want SW2

402
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,380
to synchronize its VLAN database to SW1.

403
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,930
Which command should you use on SW2?

404
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:36,450
A, vtp mode transparent.

405
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:40,600
B, vtp transparent mode.

406
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,900
C, vlan mode transparent.

407
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,990
Or D, vtp mode client.

408
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:54,240
Pause the video to think about your answer.

409
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,630
The answer is a, vtp mode transparent.

410
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:04,590
A switch in VTP transparent mode will forward
VTP advertisements, but it won’t sync its

411
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:07,270
VLAN database to the VTP server.

412
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:14,320
It also won’t advertise its own VLAN database.  Let's go to question 3.

413
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,409
What are two methods to reset a switch’s
VTP revision number to 0?

414
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:19,830
(Choose two.

415
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,330
Each answer is a complete solution).

416
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:27,280
A, change the VTP domain to an unused domain
name.

417
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,160
B, change the switch to VTP server mode.

418
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,410
C, change the switch to VTP transparent mode.

419
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:39,250
Or D, use the VTP RESET command.

420
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:46,000
Pause the video to think about your answer.

421
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,660
The answers are A, change the vtp domain to
an unused domain name, and C, change the switch

422
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,530
to VTP transparent mode.

423
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:59,150
Either of these methods will reset the revision
number to 0.

424
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:03,410
This is useful if adding a switch with a higher
VTP revision number to a network.

425
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:09,280
Okay, now let’s go to today’s Boson ExSim
question.

426
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:14,500
For today's Boson ExSim practice question,
I've selected not a multiple choice question,

427
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,820
but a drag-and-drop question.

428
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:21,240
So this is about DTP, Dynamic Trunking Protocol.

429
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:28,580
Select the VLAN trunking operational modes
from the left, access, trunk and also misconfig,

430
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,100
and drag them to the resulting trunking configuration.

431
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:36,880
So here we have one end of the connection,
one switch interface.

432
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,100
And then the other switch, the other end.

433
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:43,400
Access, dynamic auto, dynamic desirable, or
trunk.

434
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,050
Okay, so see if you can complete this chart
on your own.

435
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:51,620
Pause the video if you want to try it.

436
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,230
Okay, so let's walk through the answers.

437
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:59,130
So, here on one end of the connection, access
mode.

438
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:04,650
Manually configuring a switch port in access
mode turns off DTP negotiation.

439
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,720
It won't form a trunk port, no matter what.

440
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:13,549
So, two access ports will result in an operational
mode of access.

441
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:17,300
Access and dynamic auto, same thing.

442
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:22,820
So, dynamic auto can form a trunk but it won't
actively try to form a trunk unless the other

443
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,330
end is trying to form a trunk.

444
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:27,160
So, that will be access.

445
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,090
Access and dynamic desirable.

446
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:35,080
Although this end is trying to form a trunk,
this end will not, so that is access.

447
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,169
Now, access and trunk that is a misconfig.

448
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:41,080
Do not do this in a real network.

449
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:45,270
You can try it out in a lab to see what happens,
but do not do it in a real network.

450
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:48,380
You will encounter problems.

451
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,850
Dynamic auto and access, well we just saw
that here.

452
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,690
That will be an access port.

453
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,550
Dynamic auto and dynamic auto.

454
00:33:55,550 --> 00:34:01,490
Neither is actively trying to form a trunk,
so that will be access.

455
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,500
Dynamic auto and dynamic desirable.

456
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:08,109
This end is actively trying to form a trunk,
so they will form a trunk.

457
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:14,069
Same thing, dynamic auto and trunk will form
a trunk.

458
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:19,879
Even if you manually configure 'switchport
mode trunk', DTP is still running and this

459
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:22,550
end will actively try to form a trunk with
the other end.

460
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,909
And since it is dynamic auto, they will form
a trunk.

461
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:30,829
Okay, dynamic desirable and access, that will
result in access.

462
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:34,740
This end will refuse to become a trunk.

463
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:39,099
Dynamic desirable and dynamic auto, that will
form a trunk.

464
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:42,099
Two dynamic desirables definitely form a trunk.

465
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:43,909
And this one as well, trunk.

466
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:47,349
Okay, next, moving on to trunk on this end.

467
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:50,259
Trunk and access, again that is a misconfig.

468
00:34:50,259 --> 00:34:53,529
Don't do this in a real network.

469
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:57,789
Trunk and dynamic auto will form a trunk.

470
00:34:57,789 --> 00:35:00,460
Trunk and dynamic desirable, of course.

471
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,589
And, of course, trunk and trunk also will
form a trunk.

472
00:35:04,589 --> 00:35:08,809
So once you've finished, click on 'done'.

473
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:10,779
And then click on 'show answer'.

474
00:35:10,779 --> 00:35:14,829
Now, if you don't want to check the answer
yet you can click on next to go to the next

475
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:17,210
question in the practice exam.

476
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,400
But let's see if I got the correct answer.

477
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,829
And, I did.

478
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:26,150
Okay, here is Boson's explanation, you can
read it if you want.

479
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,119
And there are also references here.

480
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:34,490
The official cert guide by Wendell Odom, volume
1 chapter 8: Implementing Ethernet VLANs.

481
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,540
And some additional reading from Cisco.

482
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,640
I will link some reading from Cisco in the
video description, by the way.

483
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,279
And this category shows which category of
the exam topics list this question is from.

484
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:48,099
This is from the 'network access' category.

485
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:52,009
Okay, so that's today's ExSim practice question.

486
00:35:52,009 --> 00:35:56,569
If you want to get a copy of ExSim for yourself,
and I highly recommend you do, they are fantastic

487
00:35:56,569 --> 00:36:01,359

the video description.

488
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,640
There will be supplementary materials for
this video.

489
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,539
There will be a review flashcard deck to use
with the software ‘Anki’.

491
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,819
There will also be a packet tracer practice
lab to help you practice the configurations

492
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:19,520
from this video.

493
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,210
That will be in a separate video.

494
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:29,049
