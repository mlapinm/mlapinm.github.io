this lab will be the first in a series of three labs on nat
19.651040
network address translation
21.521060
this first lab will cover static NAT
24.654227
static NAT creates a one-to-one relationship between an inside address typically an IP address in a private address range such as 192.168.1.0
35.688352
and an outside address typically a public IP address on the Internet
40.248039
I won't explain in detail how NAT works hopefully you've already studied it
45.527434
this lab will give you some basic practice in configuring static NAT
48.876975
let's look at step 1
52.390495
rip has been pre-configured so that any device on this network should be able to reach any other device
57.679724
let's try a ping from pc-1 server one
61.691661
ping 1.1.1.100
67.807911
it doesn't work why could this be
75.442452
I wrote a hint here stating that the serial connection between r1 and r2 is using ACLs to simulate the Internet
84.317285
what exactly does that mean
86.642639
well PC ones address is 192.168.1.12
92.007784
this is a private IP address
94.333284
these private IP addresses cannot be routed over the internet
98.347637
so when PC one attempts to ping server one the source IP is 192.168.1.12
105.990178
and the destination is 1.1.1.100
110.224573
1.1.1.100 is a public IP address so it can be routed over the Internet
115.270698
however when server one sends a reply the addresses are swapped
120.893427
the source addresses 1.1.1.100 and the destination addresses 192.168.1.11
129.016635
because 192.168.1.11 is in the IP address range it cannot be routed over the Internet and is dropped
138.210863
so our goal is to configure static NAT on r1 to translate the private IP addresses of pc-1 pc2 and pc3 to public IP addresses
150.491300
if we do that PC one will send a ping to server one and once again the source address will be 192.168.1.11
159.345695
and the destination 1.1.1.100
162.747007
however when the packet reaches r1
166.137611
r1 will translate the source address to whatever we specify 1.2.3.11 in this case
172.839318
when server 1 sends its reply the source address will be once again 1.1.1.100 and the destination 1.2.3.11
184.239026
when the reply reaches r1
187.601859
r1 will translate the destination address from 1.2.3.11 back to PC ones address of 192.168.1.11
196.954588
so let's get to the configuration on r1
200.716775
enable conf t first we have to specify r1s interfaces as inside or outside nat interfaces
211.820129
the inside interface faces our inside private network so G 0 0 in this case
218.424356
interface G 0 0 IP NAT inside
224.468980
the outside interface will be s 0 3 0
228.146188
our interface facing the internet
231.055271
interface as a 0 3 0 IP NAT outside exit
237.902812
now let's configure the translations themselves
241.478312
static NAT is configured with the following command
244.823249
IP NAT inside source static followed by the inside private address then the outside public address
254.369790
so for PC 1 are inside addresses 192.168.1.11 and our outside addresses 1.2.3.11
264.813060
okay that's it for a PC 1
267.472518
now let's do the same command for PC 2 just changing the addresses
272.136330
IP nat inside source static 192.168.1.12 1.2.3.12
282.166705
finally for pc 3
284.493017
IP nat inside source static 192.168.1.13 1.2.3.13
294.918267
ok our nat configuration is now complete
298.565683
let's go on the PCs and try to ping server 1 again
302.212683
from pc1 first
305.232183
ping 1.1.1.100 the ping works this time
316.230766
so our NAT configuration has been successful
319.347682
just to make sure I'll ping from PC 2 and PC 3 as well
323.432078
PC 2 first ping 1.1.1.100 again the ping works
334.928432
finally let's ping from PC 3
338.319911
ping 1.1.1.100 PC 3 works as well
347.299181
that's all for this lab
