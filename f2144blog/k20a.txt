this lab xx of these free labs I've created for YouTube will serve as a review of several of the topics we've covered in the previous 19
24.832042
I plan to do these at various points in this series 29.30156 although you could just go back and redo previous labs to serve as review
34.699568
my regular configuration labs tend to focus on just one technology at a time such as VLANs or port security
41.114527
I think that labs like this one involving multiple technologies are also beneficial
46.998558
in this lab we will configure host names the enable secret VLANs trunks port security and inter VLAN routing with router on a stick
58.427102
try to complete the lab yourself first
61.309243
then continue watching this video if you have trouble or watch it after to check your solution 66.58394 step one is to configure host names for each of the networking devices
72.395519
r one switch one and switch 2
75.877368
this is done with a single command
78.577624
host name
79.792302
let's go on r one first
82.288748
enable conf t host named r1
88.501488
next switch one
90.893059
enable conf t host name switch one
95.925156
finally switch 2
98.266837
enable conf t host name switch two
103.825952
that's it for step one
105.738412
step two is to configure an enable secret of CCNA for each networking device
114.616132
this is another fairly simple step
117.335663
remember the enable secret is an encrypted password that protects privileged exec mode of the router
123.827327
requiring a password to use the enable command
127.138543
we could also configure an enable password and then encrypt it with the service password encryption command
133.571733
however the encryption of the enable secret is more secure
137.574847
so you'll always want to use that instead 139.85111 let's do switch to first since we're here
143.213483
enable secret CCNA
146.374858
remember passwords are case sensitive so make sure CCNA is all capitals
151.322811
now let's use the same command on switch 1
155.070335
enable secret CCNA
158.386667
and finally r1 enable secret CCNA 164.91777 that's all for step 2
166.783774
step three is to configure the switch ports to which pcs are connected as access ports in specific VLANs
176.492922
pc1 & pc2 VLAN 13 & pc2 and pc 4 in VLAN 24 183.09766 let's start on switch one 185.59947 PC one is connected to f0 two so interface f0 2
192.630888
switch port mode access
194.660238
now that we've explicitly configured it as an access port let's put it in VLAN 13
200.195033
switch port access VLAN 13
203.144313
now let's configure f03 which pc 2 is connected to to be in VLAN 24
209.133615
interface f03 switch port mode access switch port access VLAN 24
217.094483
that's it for switch 1 next let's hop on switch 2
221.777834
interface f0 2 switch port mode access
226.813212
PC 3 is connected to this interface so switch port access VLAN 13
233.221732
now f03 which pc 4 is connected too
237.514995
interface f03 switch port mode access switch port access VLAN 24
245.245238
that's all for step 3
249.159886
step four is to configure a trunk between switch 1 and switch 2
255.774305
remember switch ports by default function as access ports in VLAN 1
261.376121
pcs 1 2 3 & 4 are in VLAN 13 and 24
266.862756
so even pcs in the same VLAN won't be able to communicate with each other across these two switches
272.730842
currently the two switches will only carry traffic in VLAN 1 between them
278.482151
let's configure this trunk to change that
281.711431
now which interfaces do they use to connect to each other
285.945086
let's use one CDP command to find out
288.663991
on switch 2 first since we're already here
293.136909
do show CDP neighbors
296.663197
as it shows here switch 2 is connected to switch 1 using the F 0 1 interface
303.017659
it also shows that switch 2 is connected to switch ones F 0 1 interface here
308.819796
so we don't need to use this command on switch 1
311.882595
let's configure the trunk down
314.822903
interface F 0 1 switch port mode trunk
319.690695
that's it on this switch model we don't have to configure the encapsulation type of dot1q
325.867183
if we did we would use the command switch port trunk encapsulation dot1q
333.830376
now let's go to switch 1 to do the same
337.062025
interface F 0 1 switch part mode trunk
342.986842
let's use a show command to confirm 346.40453 do show interface trunk
349.945845
as you can see f 0 1 is indeed trunking
353.730241
now pc 1 should be able to pin PC 3
357.648823
but not pc 2 and pc 4
360.276045
likewise pc 2 should be able to pin pc 4 but not pc 1 in pc 3
366.742355
let's try on pc 1 first
369.523253
ping 10.0.1.12 the ping to pc 2 doesn't work
376.173696
now to pc 3 ping 10.0.0.13
381.429038
it works
384.025984
let's confirm on PC 2
387.321826
ping 10.0.0.11
390.756389
the ping to PC 1 doesn't work
395.144521
now let's ping PC 4 which should work
397.975496
ping 10.0.1.14 it works
405.461493
our trunk has been successfully configured
408.034864
now Step five is to configure port security on the switch ports connected to PCs
416.515786
we need to enable sticky MAC address learning and change the default violation action of shutdown to restrict
423.845611
let's go on switch one
426.832016
will be using the same commands for each interface
429.683164
so let's be more efficient by configuring an interface range instead of doing each one separately
436.031805
interface range f0 2 to 3
440.827983
now we're in interface range configuration mode
444.336898
both interfaces are already explicitly configured as access ports
448.962244
so we don't have to do that this time 450.67712 switch port port security
453.907902
now port security is enabled 456.35315 let's configure sticky MAC address learning 458.88629 switch port port security MAC address sticky
462.401569
finally let's change the violation action to restrict
466.524584
which blocks offending traffic but does not shut down the port
470.065533
that is done with this command
472.388084
switch port port security violation restrict
477.385688
now let's do the same on switch 2
480.128705
again I'll configure an interface range
483.593192
interface range F 0 2 to 3
488.191279
switch port port security switch port port security MAC address sticky
494.642262
switch port port security violation restrict
498.383218
there we go step 5 is now complete
502.305852
step six is to configure inter VLAN routing with the router on a stick method
510.707798
router on a stick involves configuring sub interfaces on a router
515.274418
one for each VLAN required
517.056921
we'll do that on our ones g00 interface
520.959551
which is connected to switch ones g0 1 interface
523.955523
we also must configure switch ones g0 1 interface as a trunk
529.756868
so let's do that first
531.382001
interface g0 1
535.008668
switch port mode trunk
538.153583
okay that's all we need to do on switch 1
540.681438
let's go to r1 now
542.922051
interface G 0 0
546.454184
now router interfaces are shutdown by default
550.275507
as you may have noticed from the red port lights on the link between r1 and switch 1
555.050479
so first I'll type no shutdown to enable it
559.859419
you could also do this at the end of the configuration
563.114831
now let's create the sub interface for VLAN 13
567.447238
interface g0 0.13
571.898897
note that the sub interface name doesn't actually have to match the v/line number
576.481943
but it's good practice to do so to avoid confusion
579.603296
now first we have to set the encapsulation and VLAN
584.093013
encapsulation dot1q thirteen
587.652181
okay now let's set the IP address
591.259115
according to our instructions and the default gateway addresses i've pre configured on the pcs in this lab
596.994763
let's set it too
599.431725
IP address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
606.467312
okay that's it
608.581805
now let's configure the sub interface for VLAN 24
611.486613
interface g0 0.24 encapsulation dot1q 24 IP address 10.0.1.1 255.255.255.0
627.486923
our inter VLAN routing is now complete
630.613541
finally let's ping between pcs to make sure everything works 639.94416 we should now have full connectivity between all pcs
643.825538
to check I'll ping from PC 1 and then from PC 2
649.343095
on PC 1 let's ping PC 2 first ping 10.0.1.12
657.233868
it works
659.893286
next PC 3 ping 10.0.0.13 it works
669.143173
finally PC 4 ping 10.0.1.14 it works as well
679.859202
now let's do the same on PC 2 682.68006 first stop in PC 1 ping 10.0.0.11 it works
692.846181
PC 3-pin 10.0.0.13 it works too
702.284269
finally I'll ping PC 4 ping 10.0.1.14 it works as well
711.355959
we have full connectivity between all computers 714.33063 that's all for this lab
