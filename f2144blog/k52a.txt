in this lab we will take a look at two methods of inter VLAN routing using two small networks
27.123373
one is known as router on a stick
29.894789
which we already covered in the icnd1 labs
33.131413
but we will do a little review here
35.104788
the other method is using SVIS on a multi-layer switch
39.895079
which is a switch with routing capabilities
42.323558
let's get started
44.206328
first let's configure switch 1 for inter VLAN routing using s vis
51.405474
switch 1 isn't connected to a router in this small network
55.286182
and even if it were it might be preferable for a switch 1 to rub between VLANs itself without having to send the traffic to a router
62.914270
now pc1 & pc2 shouldn't be able to ping each other at the moment
67.878582
let's try from PC 1
70.880373
ping 10.0.2.10 doesn't work
82.414664
let's go on switch one and make it work
85.010643
enable conf t ok the first step is to enable IP routing on the switch
93.748309
which is done with the command IP routing
97.287663
this enables the layer 3 capabilities of this multi-layer switch
101.505121
next we just have to configure the VLANs with IP addresses
106.616496
interface VLAN 10 I configured each PC to use the dot 1 address of their subnet as a default gateway
115.361287
so for VLAN 10 IP address 10.0.1.1 255.255.255.0 also SVIS are shut down by default so remember no shutdown
131.052725
now let's configure VLAN 20
134.225454
interface VLAN 20 IP address 10.0.2.1 255.255.255.0 no shutdown
145.962558
that's all there is to it
148.102287
keep in mind I already configured switch ones interfaces connected to a PC one and PC two to be in VLAN 10 and VLAN 20
156.334995
do show VLAN brief
158.962016
there you go
160.437328
now let's try our ping once more from PC 1
163.558494
ping 10.0.2.10
169.309596
That all there is to inter VLAN routing using SBI's
178.569199
for a quick review enable IP routing on the multi-layer switch
183.477010
create the appropriate SVIS the interface VLAN command
188.105864
configure IP addresses on the SVIS and enable them with no shutdown
193.981343
next let's configure inter VLAN routing in our other small network using the router on a stick method
201.908028
by using sub interfaces r2 connect as a default gateway for multiple subnets
208.399672
using a single physical interface
210.746630
again I already configured the switch 2 interface is connected to a PC 3 and PC 4 to be in VLAN 30 and VLAN 40
219.969420
so we just have to configure the connection between switch 2 and R 2
223.777732
let's just show that PC 3 and PC for can't pin each other at the moment
229.347377
ping from PC 3 to PC 4 vping 10.0.4.10 doesn't work
245.297127
first let's go on switch 2
248.009147
enable conf t all we have to do here is configure g0 1 as a trunk
257.142855
interface g0 1 switch port mode trunk
262.349813
that's all now let's go to r2
265.924750
enable conf t let's enable the g00 interface
275.305811
interface G 0 0 no shutdown
279.736999
now let's create a sub interface for VLAN 30
283.829436
interface G 0 0.30
287.212727
next specify this sub interface as being before VLAN 30
292.171581
encapsulation dot1q 30
297.672685
next we just add the IP address
300.296580
IP address 10.0.3.1 255 255 255 0
307.644580
that's all now let's make another sub interface for VLAN 40 and do the same
313.094872
interface G 0 0.40 encapsulation dot1q 40
321.403247
IP address 10.0.4.1 255.255.255.0 that's all there is to router on a stick
332.224913
let's try that ping again from pc 3
334.818246
ping 10.0.4.1
345.030016
okay there we go
348.606411
in this lab we looked at two methods of inter VLAN routing
352.659890
SVIS and router on a stick
355.669452
that's all for this lab
