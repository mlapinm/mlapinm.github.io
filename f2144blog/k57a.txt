in this lab we will configure OSPF version 3
26.310957
until now the OSPF we have been configuring is OSPF version 2
32.620602
OSPF version 3 however is used with ipv6
37.275415
the configuration is largely similar with one major difference that actually makes OSPF v3 simpler to configure
46.365332
let's get started
47.608644
the first step is to create loopback interfaces on each router
52.861644
these will become the router ID for OSPF
56.741936
although OSPF v3 is used with ipv6 the router ID still comes in the form of an ipv4 address
65.464227
that is a 32-bit number in dotted decimal format
69.031998
same with OSPF v to the router ID can be manually configured
75.642873
if it's not manually configured the highest ipv4 address on the loopback interface will be used
83.439748
if there is no loopback interface the highest ipv4 address on a regular interface will be used
90.289561
let's quickly make these loop backs on our one first
94.327790
enable compte interface l0 IP address 1.1 1.1 255 255 255 255 exit
111.197957
next are to
113.908394
enable compte interface l0 IP address 2 2 2 2 255 255 255 255 exit
127.211894
next r3 enable coffee/tea interface l0 IP address 3 3 3 3 255 255 255 255 exit
144.248894
ok next are 4 enable coffee tea interface l0 IP address 4.4.4 for 255 255 255 255 exit
159.760581
ok finally r5
163.060185
enable compte interface l0 IP address v dot v dot v dot v 255.255.255.0
178.606704
all for step 1
181.175329
now let's enable OSPF v3 on each router
186.256558
let's go back to our one
187.865787
to enter OSPF v3 configuration mode just type ipv6 in front of the regular OSPF command
197.697266
ipv6 router OSPF one
202.083829
however in OSPF v3 we don't activate OSPF on each interface from OSPF configuration mode
211.154641
we configure it on each interface in interface configuration mode
215.496537
so by using the ipv6 router or SOS PF one command
222.019995
we simply created the OSPF v3 process number one
225.977724
now let's activate OSPF v3 on G 0 0 and G 0 1
233.206412
interface G 0 0
235.600391
we activate it with this command
238.080891
ipv6 OSPF followed by the process ID 1
244.389620
then area then the area number 1
248.214745
that's it
250.076911
interface G 0 1 IP v6 OSPF one area 1 ok
258.260869
now let's go to our for also an area 1
260.906994
now on our one we use the command ipv6 router OSPF one
271.813744
but we didn't actually do any commands from that configuration mode
274.699952
if we go directly to the interface and enable OSPF v3 on it let's see what happens
280.783556
interface g00
283.343827
ipv6 OSPF one area one
288.516077
do show run
290.805952
ok there it is on the interface
295.687972
and there you can see that the router created the OSPF v3 process number one for us
303.476035
ok next let's configure OSPF v3 on the remaining routers
308.789180
make sure to put each interface in the correct area
312.295951
our two next
313.916535
interface g00 ipv6 OSPF one area one
323.723701
interface g0 1 IP v6 OSPF one area zero
331.243910
ok next is our 3
334.874868
interface g 0 0 ipv6 OSPF one area 0
344.375930
interface g 0 1
347.885243
IP v6 OSPF one area -
351.457138
ok finally let's go on our 5
354.701263
interface g 0 0 ipv6 OSPF one area -
363.330346
ok we have configured OSPF v3 on each router
368.374263
let's wait a few seconds and then check if r5 has received all the routes it should be receiving
374.979179
okay now before we check that
382.992867
let's use a couple of show commands here on r5
386.674971
typically I'd use commands like show IP protocols
390.558721
show IP ospf for show IP ospf neighbor
394.650596
however for OSPF v3 we have to change the IP in those commands to ipv6
401.502804
show ipv6 protocols
404.679429
as you can see this gives us minimal information
408.891367
but it does show which interfaces are when are in which areas which is useful
413.108763
show ipv6 OSPF this command gives us more details including things like timers
422.347263
you can see the router idea of v dot v dot v dot v which was inherited from loopback zeros ipv4 address
430.701513
show ipv6 OSPF neighbor
435.769158
here you can see our 5s OSPF v3 neighbor ship with r3
440.770492
ok now let's check those reps
443.577554
do show ipv6 repped
448.410992
looks like we have the OSPF routes we need
453.711575
and the o i indicates OSPF inter area routes
458.469137
since these networks are all outside of our 5s area -
462.434950
ok now we have one more task
465.987054
our one is connected to the internet
468.750846
so let's make a default route on r1
471.635679
and then advertise it into OSPF
474.165179
first let's create the default route
479.069783
so we start with ipv6 route
484.925846
and then to make a default route type a double colon followed by a slash 0 mask
490.663075
then let's give it a next hop of 2001 DB 8 0 1 0 1 double colon -
503.226346
ok do show ipv6 route
506.615742
okay there's the route
508.809908
now to advertise the route into OSPF v3
513.079012
first enter OSPF v3 configuration mode
516.091762
ipv6 router OSPF one
521.051179
now the command to advertise a default route into OSPF v3 is the same as in OSPF v2 for ipv4
531.235887
however I didn't include this command in the previous lab
533.676075
so I wanted to show it in this lab
535.798408
that command is default information originate
541.624929
that's it
543.372345
okay so now let's go to one of the other routers and see if the default route appears
549.477158
I'll go check out our to
551.748908
do show ipv6 route
558.494720
there it is right at the top
561.336741
in this lab we looked at OSPF v3 which is used for ipv6
568.095991
there isn't much difference between it and OSPF v2
572.643325
just remember to configure it at the interface level
575.979575
that's all for this lab
