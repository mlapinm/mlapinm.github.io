in this lab we will take another look at the port security function of Cisco switches
13.375586
specifically we will learn about the sticky MAC address function
18.143208
the sticky MAC address function of port security saved secure MAC addresses into the switch configuration
24.561384
when they are dynamically learned on a switch port with port security enabled
28.865184
try to complete this lab yourself first

then continue watching this video if you have trouble or watch it after to check your solution

there are a few more steps in this lab than in my previous labs
41.728882
but these are all pretty short steps
43.440883
step one is to enable port security on the switch ports connected to end hosts
49.305773
let's go on switch one first
52.136987
enable counf T interface F 0 2
59.324556
remember we have to set the interface as an access port first
63.868451
so switch port mode access
67.024898
switch port port security
69.564311
that's all for switch 1 now let's do the same on switch 2
73.686722
enable conf t interface F 0 2 switch port mode access
82.548547
switch port port security
84.993764
now let's go straight into step 2
88.467634
which is to ping from pc1 to pc2
91.469396
to generate traffic between them
93.620753
remember that no traffic is passing between these pcs by default
98.490261
so the switches won't learn the MAC addresses of the PCs
101.751385
until we send some traffic between them
103.983482
I'll ping from PC one
106.340348
ping 192.168.1.12 there we go
114.831355
step 3 is to view the secure MAC addresses on switch 1
120.817022
I'll go back to switch 1
123.037859
and now I'll use the command show port security address
130.401318
as in the previous lab
131.868589
as you can see there is a dynamically learned secure MAC address on the Fast Ethernet 0 2 interface
138.927039
which must be PC ones
141.475942
step four says to check the configuration of switch ones Fast Ethernet 0 to interface in the running configuration
150.981838
show running config
154.028618
here it is as you can see there are only the two commands we entered before
160.911008
switch port mode access and switch port port security
164.928422
remember this as we will contrast it with sticky mag address configuration later
170.861465
step 5 is to save the running config and reload the switch
175.782073
I'll use write to save then reload 180.11067 ok now the switch is reloading
184.704112
step 6 is to view the secure MAC addresses on switch 1 again
195.112728
do you think PC ones MAC address will still be saved as a secure MAC address
200.722924
we saved the running configuration but PC ones MAC address wasn't anywhere in the running configuration
208.361641
so let's check the port security address table again
213.068455
enable show port security address 217.6333 as you can see PC ones MAC address is no longer present
222.268412
dynamically learned secure MAC addresses will not be retained when you restart the switch
227.983235
even if you save the running configuration because the address isn't actually entered into the runner configuration when it is dynamically learned
235.363753
step 7 is to enable the sticky secure MAC address feature on switch ones f02 interface
244.266878
conf t interface f0 2 249.13973 now this feature is enabled with this command 252.65166 switch port port security MAC address sticky
258.736498
that's it
260.519249
now let's ping between the PCs again to generate traffic
264.368246
on PC one ping 192.168.1.11
271.617883
that's all for step 7
274.760441
step 8 is to view the secure MAC addresses of switch 1
281.388544
then the running config
283.143796
so on switch 1 show port security address
288.849657
there is PC ones MAC address again
291.802717
this time it is listed as a secure sticky address
295.151737
what's the difference well let's check the running configuration 300.03205 show run as you can see in addition to the three commands we manually configured on the interface 309.1951 there is a fourth one which we didn't configure
311.926622
switch port port security MAC address sticky
316.075433
followed by PC ones MAC address
318.387568
this is because we enabled the sticky feature
322.326921
when this feature is enabled the switch saves dynamically learned secure MAC addresses to the running configuration of the switch
329.909723
step nine is to save the running configuration and reload again
335.938255
let's do that
337.229666
write reload
340.319308
step 10 is to view the secure MAC addresses on switch one once again
351.921145
this time do you expect to see PC ones MAC address in the table
357.277171
PC ones MAC address was saved to the running configuration of switch 1 361.95219 and we saved the running configuration before reloading
365.295647
so it should be in the table even after restarting
368.594705
let's check
371.021187
enable show port security address
376.133495
as expected PC ones MAC address is still saved as a secure MAC address on the f02 interface
384.595637
so to review without the sticky feature enabled dynamically learned secure MAC addresses are not retained when the switch is reloaded
393.555175
the sticky MAC address learning feature however automatically saves these addresses to the running configuration 400.4179 and thus will be retained upon reload if the runner configuration is saved
404.812631
that's all for this lab
