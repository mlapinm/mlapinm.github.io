in this lab we will use the system configuration dialog to do some basic setup of a router r1 and a switch switch one
17.951206
the system configuration dialog is a basic setup wizard that allows you to perform basic setup of things like the hostname and interface IP addresses of a device
29.593011
although you typically will be doing these things with the commands themselves you should familiarize yourself with the system configuration dialog as well
38.656193
try to complete the lab yourself first then continue watching this video if you have trouble or watch it after to check your solution
47.0438
our goal is to do some basic configurations on these two devices with the system configuration dialog
55.4966
let's go on r1 first
57.682979
if this is the first time entering the CLI you will be asked whether you want to enter the system configuration dialog
65.576508
however I have already previously answered no to this
69.674217
that's no problem I'll type in able to enter privileged exec mode
74.077797
then use the command setup and then answer yes to enter the configuration dialog
79.850683
next we are asked if you want to enter basic management setup which as stated here only configures enough connectivity for management of the system
90.429979
let's go through the extended setup this time although we will only be configuring one interface
95.9823
so let's type no
97.685636
now we are asked if you want to see the current interface summary
103.045464
the answer in brackets is the default answer so I could just hit enter to continue or type in no to skip it
110.465146
I could of course type in yes to I just don't have to
114.309246
I'll hit enter to view the summary
117.366835
as you can see there are three Gigabit Ethernet interfaces as well as a VLAN one interface on r1
124.883897
now we are asked for the hostname
127.958476
currently it is router and that is also the default answer
132.232732
let's change the hostname to r1
135.763431
now we are asked for the enable secret as you may remember and as is written here the enable secret is used to enter privileged exec mode
146.568767
and is automatically encrypted
148.600481
according to the instructions for this lab
152.192444
let's use an enable secret of Cisco with a capital C
156.07317
which is important because these passwords are case sensitive
159.088584
next the enable password
163.326876
CCNA in all caps
165.917872
then the virtual terminal password
169.669834
we look at accessing the router over a network interface in another lab for now let's just set a password of CCENT in all caps
178.281989
then we are asked if we want to configure SNMP network management
184.343249
I'll hit enter to accept the default of no
187.244598
SNMP will be for later labs
189.702281
then again as I don't want to configure the VLAN one interface at this time
195.325401
now the Gigabit Ethernet 0 0 interface is the one used to connect to switch 1 so let's configure it
203.042621
type yes and hit enter
205.829633
the IP address is 192.168.1.1
210.696433
and now we'll accept the default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 by hitting Enter
218.030646
I don't want to configure that gig 0 1 interface or that gig 0 2 interface
224.736546
now we're at the final option
228.297716
we can cancel this config with 0 redo it with 1 or save the config with 2
235.216611
let's accept the default answer of 2 by hitting Enter
238.790694
that's it
240.231867
now let's use show startup config to confirm
244.263425
here's our hostname of our one
247.718703
our encrypted enable secret and our unencrypted enabled password
253.089857
the IP address of gig 0
258.947676
and the password on the vty line which is the virtual terminal mentioned before
264.83408
our ones configuration is complete
267.795849
next let's go through the setup dialog for switch 1
274.942063
enable setup yes to enter the configuration dialog
283.626909
know as we don't want to enter basic management setup
288.481873
let's just hit enter to view the interface summary
292.068849
as you can see there are a lot of interfaces which is expected switches require more interfaces than routers as they're going to be connecting lots of end hosts to them
303.518577
let's change the hostname to switch 1
307.155561
and now the same passwords as on r1
310.770105
Cisco with a capital C for the enable secret
314.950968
CCNA in all caps for the enable password
320.037908
and C sent in all caps for the virtual terminal password
323.940784
enter to accept the default of no as we don't want to configure SNMP at this time
331.686529
now type yes and hit enter to configure the VLAN 1 interface
336.90723
we're going to give the VLAN 1 interface an IP address
341.658118
note that physical switch interfaces or switch ports cannot be given an IP address
347.528874
however you can give an IP address to one VLAN interface
352.426624
which can then be used to connect to the switch for management purposes something we'll do in a later lab
357.287996
we're going to configure the VLAN 1 interface here
361.086722
as we're going to need the IP address to receive the response from our one when we ping it in the next step
366.686264
the IP address will be 192.168.1.2
372.56858
hit enter to accept the default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0
379.429832
now keep hitting Enter to skip configuration of these interfaces
384.325061
we won't be configuring them for now
386.409478
type know as we won't be configuring this as a cluster command switch which is beyond the scope of this lab
397.432928
now hit enter one more time to save the configuration
401.21944
let's type show startup config again to check
405.290424
there's the hostname of switch one
408.424046
hour enable secret and password
412.480064
our IP address on VLAN 1
417.703653
and our password on the vty lines
421.658959
by the way for those wondering vty stands for virtual teletype
427.609998
ok now finally let's ping from switch 1 to r1
431.309725
ping 192.168.1.1 the ping succeeds
439.360195
that's all for this lab
