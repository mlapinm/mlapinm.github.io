this lab will be a little different than other labs there will be no configurations although we will use show commands later to confirm our answers
29.330583
using the information on the lab topology here we must answer these questions
35.415603
in this topology of 4 switches we must identify the root bridge and then which ports are route ports designated ports and alternate or blocked ports across all these switches
47.664228
this should test your knowledge of STP and how STP elections actually work
53.004436
there could very well be questions similar to this on the test as well so
57.216061
make sure you can solve problems like this
59.298561
let's get started
62.786727
which switch is the root bridge
64.880206
the switch with the lowest bridge ID will become the root bridge
69.445831
remember the bridge ID consists of the priority and the MAC address of the switch
74.903768
so the switch with the lowest priority will become the root or if there is a tie the switch with the lowest MAC address
81.923143
well all four switches have the same priority
85.924538
of 3 to 769 so let's compare the MAC addresses
89.374913
by looking at the first four characters of each mac
94.416038
we can rule out - switch - and switch 4
96.549100
neither of them has the lowest MAC address
99.428954
switch 1 and switch two have the same first 4 characters but if you look at the next 4 you can tell that switch 1 has the lowest Mac
107.618329
so let me type in the answer
109.551640
which switch is the root bridge switch 1
113.717765
now on the root bridge all ports are designated ports
118.710765
so I'll type those in as well
120.549619
designated ports switch 1 F 0 1 F 2 0 2
127.649869
okay now let's continue
131.102244
each of the other three switches will set their interface with the lowest cost to the root as a report
137.539306
on switch 2 that's obviously f02 and on switch three that's F 0 1
144.090076
let me write those down
145.522221
now on switch for which port is it
151.905409
well F 0 1 is a fast ethernet interface so the spanning tree cost will be 19 to switch 2 plus 19 to switch 1 so 38
162.440346
G 0 1 is a Gigabit Ethernet interface so the cost will be 4 to switch 3 plus 19 to switch 1 so 23
170.983721
therefore G 0 1 will be the route port on switch 4
175.933408
now the interface across from a root port has to be designated
181.131720
so a switch 3 SG 0 on interface will be designated also
185.339095
now the question is which port is blocked
189.886553
switch 2 sf0 one interface or switch 4 Zepp 0 one interface
195.640178
to determine this we first compare the route cost the total cost to the root bridge
203.599428
switch 2 has a lower cost to the root bridge so it's f0 one interface will be designated and switch 4 is f0 one interface will be blocked
212.800240
ok let's check our answers with some show commands
219.802260
I'll go on switch one first
222.147468
enable show spanning tree
227.359176
this bridge is the root and F 0 1 and F 0 2 are indeed designated ports
233.670821
next let's go on switch 2
236.394300
enable show spanning tree
241.060237
F 0 1 is designated and F 0 2 is the root port
246.694258
great now let's check on switch 3
249.614008
enable show spanning tree
255.705320
F 0 1 is the report and G 0 1 is designated
261.147445
finally let's check on switch 4
264.503674
enable show spanning tree
269.535549
F 0 1 is alternate meaning it is blocked and G 0 1 is the root port
276.015799
ok our answers are correct
278.338402
this has been a fairly short lab but hopefully you're able to improve your understanding of spanning tree protocol
285.098048
that's all for this lab
