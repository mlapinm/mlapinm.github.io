in this lab we will practice some basic ipv6 configurations
25.307415
including ipv6 address configuration slack or stateless address auto-configuration
31.783769
and ipv6 static routing
34.538727
let's get right into it
36.291518
the first step is to enable ipv6 on the routers and configure some ipv6 addresses
42.703038
I'll go on r1 first
44.995288
enable conf t ipv6 is not enabled by default
52.514121
to enable it use this command
55.449579
ipv6 unicast routing
58.471704
now let's configure the addresses according to the network diagram
62.443516
interface g00 ipv6 address 2001 DB 8 1 2 3 1 2 3 : 1/64
76.755557
also let's enable the interface
79.441145
no chef
80.852082
interface G 0 1 IP v6 address 2001 DB 8 1 1 : 1/64 no chef
92.346769
makes it
93.766748
okay let's check
95.306873
do show ipv6 interface brief
98.617123
there are the addresses we configured but what are these other addresses
103.534268
there link local addresses and they are automatically generated on ipv6 interfaces
109.979768
these addresses are never routed they only work on the local link
114.817309
link local addresses are in the fe80 slash 10 range
120.369101
ok that's it for r one
123.182017
next let's go on r2
125.258225
enable conf t on r 2 we will only configure the g0 one interface for now
134.544015
as in the next step we will use slack to configure the address for the g00 interface
139.436992
interface G 0 1 IP p6 address 2001 DB 8 2 2 : 1/64 no shutdown
152.297055
ok let's go on r3 and do the same
156.776555
enable conf t interface g 0 1 IP v6 address 2001 DB 8 3 3 : 1/64 no shutdown
174.583158
ok now in step 2 we will use slack stateless address auto-configuration to automatically generate ipv6 addresses for r2 and r3 SG 0 0 interfaces
187.729845
how does slack work
190.632115
to put it briefly ipv6 uses NDP or neighbor discovery protocol
196.258281
and as part of NDP r1 is currently sending RA or router advertisement messages on its G 0 0 interface
204.471864
when we configure slack r2 and r3 will receive these messages and use them to learn the network prefix
213.368906
which is 2001 DB 8 1 2 3 1 2 3 / 64 in this case
218.940926
they will take that prefix and use a modified version of their own MAC address to generate the rest of the IP address
225.686156
hopefully you've learned this in your studies if you're not familiar with it now make sure you are for the test
230.928364
anyway the configuration is simple
234.081468
we are on our 3 already so let's do it here first
237.643509
interface G 0 0 no shutdown ipv6 address Auto config exit
247.026738
next I'll go on r2
249.510904
interface G 0 0 no shutdown ipv6 address Auto config exit
259.020967
these routers won't generate their addresses immediately so I'll pause the video as we wait for the router advertisements from R 1 to reach them
266.668779
okay I'm on r2 and as you can see from the output of the show ipv6 interface brief command
276.483237
r2 has generated an ipv6 address for its g00 interface
281.357278
and on r3 you can see the same
286.675632
next let's configure some ipv6 static routes
293.076986
on each router will have to configure two static routes
296.835277
one for each of the other routers internal networks
300.221777
now to configure an next hop address of r2 and r3
307.227236
we will have to use their slack addresses which are not easy to remember
310.955652
so to do so I'll be copy and pasting their addresses
315.208318
first let me copy r2s g00 address
319.237776
okay now I'll create the first route on r1 to r2's internal network
329.829609
ipv6 route 2001 DB 8 2 2 : / 64
341.740546
now let me paste in r2's address
344.930316
there we go
346.994900
now since I already have r2 SG 0 0 address copied I'm going to configure the same route on r3
354.553649
ipv6 route 2001 DB 8 2 2 : / 64
365.399190
and paste r2's address in
368.363689
there we go
370.849022
now I'll copy r3s G00 interface address
374.707854
and make a route to its internal network on r1 and r2
378.723041
there we go
380.716957
now I'll go on r1
383.196540
IP v6 route 2001 DB 8 3 3 : / 64 and paste in the address
395.948185
there we go next on r2
400.305664
ipv6 route 2001 DB 8 3 3 : / 64 and once again paste in the address
412.189163
okay now let's configure routes to r1s internal network on r2 and r3
419.895767
since i'm on r2 already let's start here
422.964892
ipv6 route 2001 DB 8 1 1 : / 64 2001 DB 8 1 2 3 1 2 3 : 1
437.179725
ok now on r3
440.702995
ipv6 route 2001 DB 8 1 1 : / 64 2001 DB 8 1 2 3 1 2 3 : 1
458.661744
ok all of our routes are now configured
462.344639
for this video I won't ping from each router but let's just try out some things from r3 to test
468.169826
first I'll ping PC ones address exit ping 2001 DB 8 1 1 : 64
480.043367
ok the ping works
483.682158
and now I'll ping PC 2 ping 2001 DB 8 2 2 : 64 again the ping works
496.386095
in this lab we configured manual ipv6 addresses slack addressing and ipv6 static routes
504.447448
that's all for this lab
