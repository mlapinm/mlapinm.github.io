in this lab we will be working with two switches switch 1 and switch 2 and 4 pcs pc-1 pc2 pc 3 and PC 4
19.955083
we will assign these computers to VLANs
23.576648
VLANs or virtual lands are used to isolate computers at layer 2 29.89855 if you look at the network diagram you will notice that these 4 computers are in the same layer 3 network
36.698614
that 1.0.0.0 / 24 network
41.113068
we will use VLANs to separate them into two groups of two
46.203877
try to complete the lab yourself first
49.452383
and then continue watching this video if you have trouble or watch it afterwards to check your solution
54.960541
step one is to ping between the computers to check connectivity
61.258982
let's do this on pc one 63.50488 I'll ping PC to first
68.315315
pin 1.0.0.2 to the pin works
73.348651
next PC 3
75.237043
ping 10.0.0.3 the ping works again
79.868242
next PC four 81.92165 ping 10.0.0.4
84.805856
all of our pings worked as expected
87.948724
that's all for step 1
90.151799
step two is to assign pc1 & pc2 vlan1
98.563526
and PC to and PC four to VLAN two 102.02136 this is done by configuring the switch interfaces they are connected too
107.466508
let's do this on switch one first
109.825902
so we'll be assigning pc-1 to VLAN 1 and PC 2 to VLAN 2
115.507132
enable conf t
120.950041
PC one is connected to Fast Ethernet 0 2 so interface f0 2 127.79925 now I will enter the command switch port mode access
133.489507
switch ports connected to end hosts like a PC should be configured as access ports
139.613778
switch ports are in access mode by default but I like to explicitly configure this 146.09588 next we will assign it to VLAN 1
149.843853
switch port access VLAN 1
153.592921
next is PC 2 which is connected to Fast Ethernet 0 3 interface f0 3
162.657601
switch port mode access 165.73751 switch port access VLAN 2
168.177257
as you can see the switch creates VLAN 2 for us
171.559603
because we hadn't created it before
173.887035
let's check the running config to confirm our configuration
178.713979
do show run on
182.634992
both interfaces you can see the switch port mode access command
187.162208
and on Fast Ethernet 0 3 you can see it is assigned to VLAN two
192.903867
but why don't we see our switch port access via an one command on Fast Ethernet 0 2 198.76762 this is because of what's called the native VLAN
202.708909
in normal VLANs the switch tags the packet from that VLAN to identify it as belonging to that VLAN
210.761517
the native VLAN however doesn't need to be tagged
215.037345
and any packets that are untagged are assumed to belong to that VLAN
219.555577
and VLAN 1 is the default native VLAN on Cisco switches
224.905294
because of this by default all interfaces belong to VLAN one
230.697352
if you try to explicitly configure an interface as VLAN one 235.06166 it won't even show up in the configuration as you can see here
238.956898
note that the native VLAN can be changed and for security purposes it often is
245.163209
but for this lab we will keep it as is
248.080379
next let's hop over to switch two
251.615847
enable conf T interface f02 257.82405 let's do the exact same thing as with pc1 & pc2
261.626809
switch port mode access
264.183612
switch port access VLAN one
267.462302
interface f03
270.913277
switch port mode access switch port access VLAN two
275.750091
there we go let's check the running config on switch two as well
280.273484
do show run
282.954998
again we see the same thing as on switch one
286.709803
step two is now complete
288.803406
step three is to attempt to ping between PC one and PC3 and PC two and PC four
299.253312
so we're going to attempt to ping between computers in the same VLAN 303.43147 let's hop on PC one first
306.477165
ping 10.0.0.3 the pings are successful
313.821203
next let's hop on PC2
316.617918
ping 10.0.0.4
321.868637
our pings fail
327.358279
why is that
328.606538
pc1 & pc2 same VLAN
331.557225
and their pings worked
333.244937
PC 2 and PC 4 are in the same VLAN as well
337.168459
so why can't we ping between them
340.232972
remember what I said about the native VLAN
343.245626
the fastethernet 0/1 interfaces of switch 1 and switch 2 are assigned to the native VLAN
349.989904
which is VLAN 1 by default
352.547552
so only traffic from VLAN 1 can pass through them
356.139634
we'll fix that in step 4
358.481089
step four is to configure the interfaces connecting switch 1 and switch two as trunk interfaces
369.364215
in order to allow traffic from multiple VLANs to pass between the two switches
374.500603
we must configure their fastethernet 0/1 interfaces as trunk interfaces
379.464989
let's do that on switch one first
382.512166
interface f01
388.177883
switch port mode trunk
390.308118
next switch two
393.017568
interface f01 switch port mode trunk
400.091967
that's it for step 4
402.685414
Step five is to once again ping between the computers
408.675267
if we correctly configured everything we should be able to ping between PC one and PC3 and between PC two and PC four
418.142776
but the other pings should fail
420.085872
let's start from PC one again
423.099286
first let's ping PC two
426.223408
as expected the pings failed
433.229358
next PC three which should succeed
436.847325
as expected the ping succeeded
442.422032
finally PC four
446.282995
again the pings failed
450.903521
let's ping from PC2 as well
454.171055
ping PC one
458.516593
the pings failed
461.397392
PC three the pings failed
468.484928
finally PC4 the ping succeeded
473.227537
as you can see we have successfully isolated the computers between VLANs 478.25822 even though they're on the same layer 3 Network
481.223136
that's all for this lab
