in this lab we will be working with one router r1 and one PC PC one
14.12432
we will use PC one to connect to the console port of r1
18.869851
and perform configurations from there
21.118842
we will also set up a password to protect connections from the console port of r1
27.184047
try to complete the lab on your own first
30.53352
and continue watching this video if you have trouble
33.774879
or watch it afterwards to check your solution
36.419122
step one is to connect PC ones rs-232 port to our ones console port
45.152569
click on connections in the bottom left corner of the screen
49.17052
this is the console cable as indicated at the bottom of the screen
54.561567
connect it to the rs-232 port of PC one
59.95001
and then to the console port of r1
62.507949
that's step one
64.385472
step two is to use the console connection to configure the hostname of r1 from pc1
74.499574
to do so click on PC one click on desktop select terminal and then select ok to accept the default configurations
84.321932
we're now connected to r1 via PC one and can perform configurations as usual
90.848294
now we have to change the hostname of the router to r1 as we've done before in previous labs
97.999229
unable to enter privileged exec mode
101.20266
conf t enter global configuration mode
104.726566
hostname r1
106.476107
that's it for step two
108.726232
step three is to set the enable secret of r1 to Cisco
116.328196
if you remember the enable secret is a password that protects privileged exec mode
120.926073
and is encrypted by default
123.2163
it's configured from global configuration mode
126.6641
which we are already in
128.360855
enable secret Cisco
130.72325
step three is now complete
132.805721
step four is to set the console password of r1 to CCNA
140.763358
we also have to ensure that it is required to connect to r1 via the console port
145.884646
to do so we have to enter line configuration mode for the console port
150.675043
that is done with the command line console 0 from global configuration mode
156.148803
the zero refers to the number of the port
159.949766
and since there is only one console port there is only line console 0
164.986256
there is no line console 1 2 3 4 etc
168.665267
from here we set the password to CCNA with a very simple command
174.000063
password CCNA
176.104199
now let's try out our password
178.683994
I'll use the end command to return to privileged exec mode
182.966503
and then exit to quit the connection
185.89367
but I'm not asked for a password
188.895884
if I type enable I have to use the password Cisco to access privileged exec mode
195.023131
but why wasn't I asked to use the password CCNA to connect to the console port again
201.141207
this is because we missed one other command in line configuration mode
205.858417
let's return there once more
208.248564
conf t line con zero
211.022927
now we have to use the command login to tell the router that the password must be used to connect to the console
219.504948
let's try again and exit
223.498016
and there we go
224.464199
now we are asked for the console password of CCNA
227.866802
now finally let's check the running configuration for the password and see if it's encrypted
233.469493
enable password cisco show run
238.662364
the line section is at the bottom of the running config
241.440084
so i'll tap the spacebar a few times to scroll down
245.280339
there it is line con zero password CCNA
250.591846
as you can see it is not encrypted
252.54017
that's all for step four
254.651493
Step five is to enable password encryption to protect this console password
262.69548
compte to enter global configuration mode
265.66923
then the same command as before
267.735935
service password encryption
270.058735
let's drop back to privileged exec mode
273.006438
and then use show run to confirm
275.203606
scroll down to the bottom and you can see the password is now encrypted
280.508029
finally let's save the configuration
283.336426
let's use the copy running-config startup config command
288.055578
shorten to copy run start
290.352434
that's all for this lab
