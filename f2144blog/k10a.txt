welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer practice lab

you can download the lab file from the link in the description
8.581871
in this short lab we will connect to r1 via the console port and configure usernames and passwords
17.262797
particularly it's important to know whether usernames and passwords are case sensitive
21.816759
so we'll experiment with that in this lab
24.578764
try to complete the lab on your own first then continue watching this video if you have trouble
30.351296
or watch it after to check your solution
32.655499
step one is to use PC one to access r1 via the console port
41.670304
PC one is already connected to our ones console port so let's click on PC one
47.644722
then click desktop and terminal
50.723998
accept the default configurations here and now we're on our one
54.948878
next is to create two users on our one
59.587607
CCNA in lowercase letters with the password Cisco in lowercase letters and CCNP in lowercase with the password Cisco in uppercase
70.20123
so let's go to global config mode
73.305574
enable conf t
76.73268
you can create users with this command username CCNA password Cisco
83.459327
that's it
84.968655
now let's create the second user
87.754053
username CCNP password Cisco
91.783489
with Cisco being an uppercase this time
94.656661
now if we log out of the router and then access it again
99.023858
we still won't be asked to use a username and password
102.202123
we have to tell the console port to require a username and password
105.847023
so let's do that
107.666403
line console 0
111.195749
if you remember when we configured the line password on the console
115.099835
we use the command login to make it required to access the console port
119.456999
this time however we want to instruct the router to use the local user database instead
125.718569
that is done with this command
128.192131
login local
130.333457
so that's step 2 and step 3
132.823914
step 4 is to log out of the router and log in again with each account
139.543822
we're going to test whether or not the usernames and passwords are case sensitive
144.113047
so I'll type end to return to privileged exec mode and then log out
149.430148
let's try the CCNA a user with the password cisco in lower case as we configured
156.124534
it works let's log out again
160.144318
now I'll try the username in all caps
163.104745
with the password in lower case again
165.47374
as you can see it lets us log in
169.219869
so the username is not case-sensitive
172.185697
now let's check the password
174.951694
I'll use the CCNA username again
178.127445
doesn't matter if you type in a lowercase or uppercase
181.083492
but this time I'll type the password in all caps
184.278747
although you can't see the characters as I type
187.165127
it fails
188.846703
I'll try again in case I hit a wrong key
190.869382
doesn't work
194.460195
so the password is case-sensitive
197.604527
let's quickly try again with the CCNP username again to confirm
202.24125
I'll type the username alternating upper and lower case just to prove the point and I'll type the correct password which is all uppercase
210.253867
it works
212.890302
log out again
214.259465
this time I'll type the password in lowercase
216.625441
doesn't work so to summarize usernames are not case sensitive
222.287961
but passwords are case sensitive
225.178669
next I'll do one more demonstration even though this isn't part of the lab
233.075487
let me login again
234.81109
then enable show run
238.387859
look at the usernames and passwords here
240.992207
we're going to add a new user named CCNA with all capitals
245.315422
if we are correct about user names not being case sensitive
248.912454
it should replace the current user rather than actually creating a new user
253.136537
conf t user named CCNA password router
259.516593
do show run as you can see it didn't actually create a new user
265.766983
it still displays the user name in the lower case
268.576796
even though I typed in an upper case
270.204111
but the password is now router instead of Cisco
273.428537
