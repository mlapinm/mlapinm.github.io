in this lab we will configure ether channel
23.600814
ether channel is used to aggregates which interfaces to operate as a single logical interface
30.140836
what is the advantage of that
32.672809
well in the previous couple labs
35.396369
we looked at spanning tree protocol
37.213580
as you can tell by the port lights in packet tracer
41.119589
only one link is active between each switch
43.722764
we have four fast ethernet links connecting to switch 1 and switch 2 for example
50.673920
but only one link is actually forwarding information
53.328046
those other links still provide redundancy in case the f01 interface fails for example
60.438363
but it would be better if we could make use of them
63.273828
let's get started
64.692921
the first part is to analyze this topology from a spanning tree perspective
70.491628
now you can tell all of this by looking at the port lights and packet tracer
75.162988
but let's use some show commands to confirm
77.379405
which switch is the root bridge
80.281401
well all of switched ones port lights are on so
83.829790
there's our answer
84.859132
let's go on switch one to confirm
86.830447
enable show spanning tree
92.440016
ok this bridge is the root
95.934528
so all of the interfaces here are designated
98.796977
they're forwarding
99.909085
now how do these other switches choose their route ports
103.978700
whichever path they select the route cost is the same
108.253280
and the neighboring switches bridge ID is the same
111.710219
so the next career the next criteria
115.067702
and this is very important is the neighbors port ID
118.812260
the port ID consists of a port priority
122.388428
which is 128 by default
124.826342
and the port number
126.454800
the lowest port ID wins and is selected as the root port
130.528813
keep in mind this is the neighbors I D
133.935820
not the local switches port ID
135.880286
that is why in this topology between switch 1 and switch 2
141.267270
and between switch three and switch 4 I connected F 0 1 to F 0 for
146.100081
f 0 2 to F 0 3 etc
148.429492
instead of F 0 1 to F 0 1 F 0 2 to F 0 2 to demonstrate this
153.788109
from switch tunes perspective switch ones F 0 1 has the lowest port ID
161.176884
so it chooses its interface connected to switch ones F 0 1 interface
166.236771
which is its own F 0 4 interface as the root port
170.562417
the same goes for switch 4 which also selected its F 0 4 interface
176.218426
switch 3 chose its G 0 1 interface
181.080240
which is connected to switch to is G 0 1 interface
183.839628
also because switch to SG 0 1 interface has a lower port ID
188.817270
then switch to SG 0 2 interface
190.883006
so the interfaces across from the reports are designated
195.778381
now on the remaining links how did the switches choose which side would block and which side would designate their ports
202.539514
that is the route cost
205.096928
switch 2 is closer to switch 1 than switch 3
208.914320
so it's side of the link is designated and switch 3 side is non designated blocking
214.258742
and switch 3 is closer to switch 1 then switch 4 is so switch 3 side is designated
221.509807
and switched 4 side is non designated or blocking
224.227744
ok so that was just another review of spanning tree selection process
229.929762
it also shows the reason we use ether channel
232.754456
we want to take advantage of these redundant links
235.524681
and have them all available for use
237.168422
rather than waiting for the active link to fail
239.857924
so our first task is to configure a layer 2 ether channel between switch 1 and switch to
247.313797
using a Cisco proprietary protocol
249.843298
that protocol is port aggregation protocol pagp
254.558490
let's go on switch 1 and configure it
257.758875
coffee tea
260.506267
interface range F 0 1 2 4
265.002480
before I enter the commands I should mention some requirements of ether channel
269.477378
regardless of whether using pagp or another method in
272.994566
all ports involved must have the same configuration
276.335541
that is the same duplex full or half
280.679486
the same speed the same native
282.966356
and allowed VLANs in the same switch port mode access or trunk
286.905653
both of these switches have the same configuration by default
291.027331
so that won't be a problem here
292.215878
but keep that in mind for the next troubleshooting lab
294.832204
so regardless of the ether channel protocol
298.803587
the command begins the same
300.374880
channel - group followed by the group number
304.576603
this is necessary in case you have multiple ether channels on the same switch
309.080503
note that this number doesn't have to match the switch on the other end of the ether Cannell
314.810639
let's go with one
316.926920
then mode and this is where we determine the protocol used
321.565650
pagp has two options desirable or Auto
325.817577
much like DTP dynamic trunking protocol
329.928416
desirable will actively form an ether channel if the switch on the other end is using desirable or Auto mode
336.443903
Auto however will only form an ether channel if the other end is desirable
342.225468
let's go with desirable
344.629594
okay that's it
346.797417
do show ether channel summary
348.413018
there is po1 port channel one
352.726419
our new logical interface
354.290931
notice the SD next to it
357.354809
s indicates a layer two ether Channel
360.035875
and D means it is down
361.967711
that's because we haven't configured switch to yet
364.795602
here are the ports included in it F 0 1 2 F 0 4
369.751293
and let's configure it as a trunk
372.440998
as for the instructions
373.582562
interface port channel 1 switch port mode trunk
378.493560
ok let's do the same configuration on switch 2's end
384.166939
and then check if the ether channel is working
386.471973
enable conf T
391.779909
interface range F 0 1 - 4
394.780363
I'm just going to shut down these interfaces while I work on the ether
399.018276
shut down
400.091246
I'll use a different channel group number to show it will work even if it doesn't match with switch one
405.999386
channel group 2 mode
409.233558
and this time let's go with Auto
411.764080
although desirable would work as well
413.108071
now let's make it a trunk
416.269454
interface po2 is pork channel 2
420.136937
note on this switch model both is l and dot1q encapsulations are supported
425.919068
so we have to configure the encapsulation first
428.070837
before making a trunk
429.332787
switch port trunk encapsulation dot1q
433.341154
switch port mode trunk
435.115802
ok let's activate the interfaces
438.441289
interface range F 0 1 2 4
441.268771
no chef
442.600223
now let's check if the ether channel is up
445.689905
do show ether channel summary
448.013284
it's probably a good idea to get familiar with the meanings of these
452.071266
flag codes in the output of this command
453.867184
but that's just thinking in terms of possible test questions
457.878317
although in a real scenario you can just see them right here in the output
461.568385
there it is
463.490721
s meaning layer 2
464.912558
and you meaning in use
467.104485
our next task is to configure a layer 3 ether channel
472.278023
between switch 2 and switch 3
474.297342
you will use layer 2 ether channels more than layer 3 but
478.712195
you should know how to make one
479.730698
let's start here on switch to
482.468068
exit first enable IP routing on the switch
487.626979
to give it layer 3 capabilities
489.582376
IP routing
491.148725
now let's make the ether channel
493.813011
interface range G 0 1 2 to
498.891877
use the no switch port command first
502.737908
before making the ether channel
504.242353
this will make the interface layer 3
505.985527
then let's make a static ether channel
509.120902
channel Group 1 mode on
512.820856
is the command for a static ether Channel
515.123123
next let's assign an IP address to the interface
519.059631
interface po1
521.608111
IP address 2300 1 255.255.255.0
528.734143
ok let's configure a switch 3 side
532.717612
enable coffee/tea
536.308021
IP routing
538.572646
interface range G 0 1 2 2
541.565934
no switch port channel Group 1 mode on
546.058157
interface po1 IP address 23:02 255.255.255.0
554.542488
do show ether channel summary
557.554801
notice that a layer 3 ether channel is indicated by r
563.128134
and again there is that you for in use
565.602442
let's try to ping across the ether channel to switch to
570.064461
do ping 23:01
574.445821
and it works
578.956048
now we have one more ether channel to configure
582.530129
this time we use an I Triple E standard protocol
586.595889
that is link aggregation control protocol LACP
591.003667
let's start here on switch 3
593.493191
interface range F 0 1 2 4
598.561921
channel group 2 mode
601.253213
and let's check our options
602.946456
Elysee pees equivalent of PA gps desirable is active
607.995821
and le psyches equivalent of PA gps auto is passive
613.384188
let's go with active
615.294392
interface po2
618.534007
again on this switch model we have to configure the encapsulation
623.116955
switch port trunk encapsulation dot1q
626.038678
switch port mode trunk
628.543712
ok now let's configure the other end on switch for
632.134075
enable coffee tea
637.035571
interface range F 0 1 2 4
640.518632
let's set it down for now while we work
642.648746
shut channel Group 1 mode active
647.641648
since switch 3 side is active passive would work as well by the way
652.455798
interface po1
655.613372
switch port mode trunk
659.603122
interface range F 0 1 2 4
663.566365
no shutdown
666.075548
okay let's check if all is good
667.978859
do show ether channel summary
670.393530
we have a layer two ether channel
673.669018
and it is in use
675.147181
so we created three ether channels
677.973916
one layer two ether channel using pagp
680.977022
one static layer three ether channel
683.898156
and one layer two ether channel using LACP
687.052328
that's all for this lab
