welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer practice lab
4.381351
you can download the lab file from the link in the description
7.711086
this lab will largely be a review of VLANs
12.269324
but with a couple commands we didn't cover before
15.095584
which you should be familiar with for the test
16.829985
as always try to complete the lab on your own first
21.22814
then continue watching this video if you have trouble
24.114711
or watch it after to check your solution
26.588038
note that just for the purpose of this video I have pre-configured switch 2 to save time
31.925287
this is not the case in the lab file you can download below
36.104123
although in this lab the configurations for each switch happen to be the same
40.779842
it's good to practice them twice
42.983762
step one is to set the host names of the switches
48.614783
for most of these labs I've been pre configuring the host names but let's quickly review the command
54.7167
I'll hop on switch one and enable conf t host name switch 1
62.909658
again for this video I already configured switch 2
67.026076
step 1 is now complete
69.473172
step two is to create two VLANs on the switches and configure their names
76.630643
you may remember from previous labs that when you assign a switch interface to a VLAN that doesn't exist
83.698647
the switch automatically creates the VLAN for you
86.303929
however you can also manually create VLANs and there are situations where you'll have to do that
92.654156
the command you use to create a VLAN is also used to enter VLAN configuration mode
98.840377
which is required to configure the name of a VLAN
101.967943
first let's use the do show VLAN command
105.420704
remember that do is used to allow us to perform commands in global configuration interface configuration or other modes which we would normally have to be in privileged exec mode to use
116.459729
if you're in privileged exec mode don't include that do
120.713308
as you can see this gives us a lot of information about the VLANs
125.787031
however for our purposes now let's instead use the do show VLAN brief command
131.488062
this gives a nice summary of which VLANs we have
136.532116
and which interfaces of the switch are assigned to which VLAN
140.750763
note which VLANs are present by default
143.960696
VLAN 1 twitch all ports or interfaces are assigned by default
149.302416
also VLANs 1003 1005 which are used for FDDI and token ring 2 things you definitely don't need to worry about for your CCNA
159.831127
now the command to create VLAN 13 is VLAN 13
165.662284
as you can see this puts us into VLAN configuration mode
169.699744
also I'll use the show VLAN brief command
174.180124
and you can see that the VLAN has been created
177.182903
also note that the default VLAN name is VLAN followed by the four-digit VLAN number in this case 0 0 1 3
188.072563
now let's change the name to management with the command named management
194.76125
ok now let's use the same commands for VLAN 24 VLAN 24
202.262893
name engineering
205.206792
and now let's show VLAN briefed again and check
210.496928
we have successfully created VLAN 13 and VLAN 24 with the names management and engineering
218.29557
when you're doing the lab performed the same configurations on switch 2 and that's step 2
223.456275
step three is to place pc1 & pc2 into VLAN 13 & pc2 and pc 4 into VLAN 24
232.873363
since we're just doing switch 1 for this video I'll put PC 1 into VLAN 13 and PC 2 into VLAN 24
240.064026
first PC 1 which is connected to a Fast Ethernet 02
244.729052
interface f02 switch port access VLAN 13
251.693157
in the previous labs I also use the command switch port mode access
256.398697
but you may remember that I said this isn't necessary because the interfaces are in access mode by default
261.898656
just to prove this I won't use the command for this video
265.745851
next for PC 2 interface f03 switch port access VLAN 24
274.094956
do show VLAN briefed
276.682162
as you can see Fast Ethernet 0 2 which pc 1 is connected to is in VLAN 13 and Fast Ethernet 0 3 which pc 2 is connected to is in VLAN 24
288.094455
that's all for step 3
289.57954
step four is to configure a trunk link between switch 1 and switch 2
297.004933
they are connected by their fastethernet 0/1 interfaces
301.206311
so interface f01 switch port mode trunk
306.938347
that's it let's confirm
309.703064
and you can use this command show interfaces trunk to check which interfaces are in trunking mode
317.879553
you can see f01 is now trunking
321.611565
the encapsulation is 802.1 q which is the only option on this switch
327.13959
and the native VLAN is 1 which is the default
330.106283
you can also see that all VLANs are allowed on the trunk which is default as well
335.802469
however vlans 1 13 and 24 are the only ones that are allowed and active in management domain
344.724188
VLAN 1 because it is the native VLAN
348.460931
and the default VLAN to which all interfaces are assigned
351.83423
the 2 VLANs we created vlan's 13 and 24 also appear
356.961493
let me do the command again to refresh
361.008062
show interfaces trunk
363.774063
as you can see VLANs 1 13 and 24 also appear under VLANs in spanning tree forwarding state and not pruned
374.43307
spanning tree and pruning our topics for another time
377.996017
Step five is to save the configuration
382.979918
I haven't included this as a step in every lab but don't forget about it
387.660156
this time let's use the write to command
390.381626
there we go finally let's ping between pcs to check connectivity
396.918705
because I already set up switch 2 PC 1 should be able to ping PC 3 and PC 2 should be able to ping PC 4
404.470974
so let's go on PC 1 ping 192.168.0.3
413.021272
ok it works and now on PC 2
423.227583
ping 192.168.0.4
427.773859
it works as well
434.519253
that's all for this lab
