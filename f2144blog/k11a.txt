welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer practice lab
4.785616
you can download the lab file from the link in the description
8.262735
in this lab we will review the creation of a local user database on the router
13.799046
and introduced the banner function
16.305568
this will be a fairly short lab but try to complete it on your own first
20.578399
and then continue watching this video if you have trouble or watch it after to check your solution
25.807395
step one is to use PC one to connect to r1 via the console port
33.388313
they're already connected by a cable
35.850812
so let's click on PC one desktop terminal and press ok to accept the default configurations
45.349398
step two is to create two users on r1
49.941079
last time we created user accounts with passwords
53.36842
this time we will use secrets
55.760241
same as with the enable password and enable secret
59.7377
passwords are not encrypted but secrets are encrypted by default
63.44439
enable conf t username CCNA secret Cisco with a capital C
73.883946
remember that user name isn't case sensitive but the password or secret is
79.015255
next user username CCNP secret Cisco
85.373474
I'll quickly type do show run to check that their encrypted
90.523496
as you can see they are encrypted by default
95.760803
step 3 is to set the console port to use the local database to authenticate users
102.234008
line console 0 login local
107.375732
that's it
108.498419
step 4 is to set a message of the day banner of welcome to packet racer
117.90453
and a login banner of authorized users only
121.129215
banners are messages that display before or after users log in
126.5625
in this case the message of the day banner will be displayed above the login banner
130.78868
and both will be displayed before our user logs in
133.959567
so exit to make the banner of the day we use this command
140.799292
banner motd then I'll use the question mark to show the next option
146.400326
as you can see we need to enter a delimited character to indicate the start and end of the message
155.173746
if you type the message directly it will think that the first character is the delimiting character
161.638417
and it will be excluded from the message itself
164.300974
you can use whatever you want but I'll use an asterisk
167.71324
asterisk welcome to packet tracer asterisk
171.674127
okay now the same process for the log in banner
176.862234
banner login asterisk authorized users only asterisk
185.731055
now we've set up the two banners
188.190605
finally let's log out and see if our messages work
192.963624
and logout there we go
199.083479
before we log in you can see our message of the day and then our log in banner
