this is the third and last of our labs focusing on nat network address translation
22.974185
this lab will focus on Pat port address translation
27.762934
static NAT is sometimes referred to as one-to-one and dynamic NAT is sometimes referred to as many to many
36.393704
by that logic Pat is many to one
39.921808
many addresses are translated to a single IP address
43.722870
but the router keeps track of the layer for port number used
47.393953
so it can identify each of the inside hosts
50.378953
for example when we configure Pat in this network we can then ping from pc-1 pc2 and pc 3 to server 1 at the same time
60.536307
all of them will use the same address that of our ones as 0 3 0 interface 1.2.3.1
69.264202
however each of them will use a different port number
72.413243
so our one can forward the return traffic from server 1 back to the correct PC
77.394888
we are using the same topology as in the previous net labs
82.022263
if we try to ping server one from PC one it should fail once again
87.328783
let's try ping 1.1.1.100 the pink fails
99.868949
once again this is because PC one has an IP address in a private IP range
105.078115
these addresses are not routable on the Internet
108.260219
to simulate the Internet I have configured ACLs on r1 and r2 to prevent private IP addresses from being routed on the serial link between them
117.412594
so let's configure Pat on r1 to translate the IP addresses of pc-1 pc2 and pc 3 to the IP address of our ones s0 3-0 interface
130.235135
I'll go on r1
133.915260
enable conf t again I'll set the inside and outside NAT interfaces
143.055718
interface g00
146.325863
IP NAT inside
149.067258
interface s 0 3 0 IP NAT outside
153.804342
exit now to configure a dynamic NAT we had to configure an ACL and NAT pool before we configure the NAT statement itself
163.396195
for Pat we just create an ACL to identify the inside address range to translate
169.215215
and then we create a NAT statement to translate them to the outside interface
173.721069
let's make the ACL
176.148777
remember this ACL is used to identify traffic not to allow or block traffic
182.342735
traffic permitted by the ACL will be translated
186.515110
traffic denied by the ACL won't be translated
190.283860
but won't be blocked
191.827818
let's make an ACL to permit traffic from the 192.168.1.0 / 24 network
198.338255
access list 1 permit 192.168.0.1 0.0.0.255
208.322234
that's it
210.279525
now we just have to make the NAT statement
213.063233
the first half is identical to dynamic NAT
216.461108
IP NAT inside source list 1
221.829795
which identifies ACL 1
223.944274
next however we type interface followed by the outside interface s 0 3 0 in this case
231.750732
finally remember to add overload at the end
236.835523
this is what allows the router to translate multiple hosts to the same IP address
241.616690
and keep track of the layer for port number to identify each host
246.065023
so our command is IP NAT inside source list one interface s 030 overload
254.975877
our PAP configuration is complete
259.274772
now let's test and then check the translations on r one
262.248189
out paying server one from each of the PCs
266.084584
PC one first
267.646855
ping 1.1.1.100
272.277105
next PC 2 ping 1.1.1.100
283.174729
finally pc 3 ping 1.1.1.100
294.031895
ok now let's go on r1 and check the translations
299.522520
exit show IP NAT translations
305.999103
as you can see our inside local addresses look the same as in the previous lab
311.557436
but the inside global addresses are all the same
316.017186
as I said before however r1 keeps track of these layer for port numbers
321.823144
so it knows which PC to send the return traffic from server 1 too
325.968373
now do you remember the command to use if you want to clear these translations
330.556102
clear IP NAT translation asterisk
335.765477
show IP NAT translations
338.454018
the translation table is empty
340.944559
ok that's all for this lab
