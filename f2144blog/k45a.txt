this lab is really a review of material we have practiced in the icnd1 labs VLANs trunks and DTP
30.102144
however these topics are in the icnd2 exam topics as well
35.544060
so let's review them one more time
37.961851
the first step is to disable negotiation of trunk ports and manually configure the mode of each switch port in use
46.792496
DTP can dynamically determine whether a switch port should be a trunk or an access port
52.785037
for example if you connect a switch port to a port on another switch that is a trunk
58.487203
the switch port will become a trunk as well
60.703890
let's check on switch 1 and switch 2
63.868119
I haven't done any configuration yet so DTP is enabled on both and there should be an access mode at the moment
70.663619
I'll go on switch 1 enable show interface g0 2 switchport see it's in dynamic auto mode by default
85.325368
meaning if it's connected to a trunk or a port in dynamic desireable mode it will become a trunk port as well
91.516388
however really these configuration should all be done manually for security reasons also
98.036325
so DTP is something you should always disable
100.847198
just to show you the commands however conf t interface g0 2 switch port mode dynamic
111.093530
and let's check the options auto is as I said before it will become a trunk port if connected to a dynamic desirable port
120.080509
and desirable mode actively tries to form trunk ports with both auto and other desirable mode ports
126.198009
let's do the smart thing and disable DTP
131.651550
then manually set the mode of each switch port
134.066196
so switchport no negotiate
137.557259
that disables DTP
139.611050
switchport mode trunk
141.870279
okay now let's configure switch ones other ports
145.072404
g1 should be a trunk as it leads to r1 for inter VLAN routing
150.474008
and F 0 1 and F 0 2 should be access ports
154.399362
interface G 0 1 switch port mode trunk
159.419174
switch port no negotiate
161.846653
interface range F 0 1 to 2 switch port mode access switch port no negotiate
171.841985
ok let's go to switch to now
175.477964
enable look at this message we got on switch 2 blocking Gigabit Ethernet 0 1
183.551984
inconsistent port type
185.810463
switch ones G 0 2 interface is a trunk
189.644129
however because DTP is disabled it's not sending packets to switch 2 so that switch 2s dynamic G user 1 interface can become a trunk as well
199.545753
therefore well switch 1s G 0 2 interface is a trunk switch 2 SG 0 1 interface remains an access port
207.937398
so there is an inconsistent port type
210.071481
let's make this a trunk too
212.330189
conf t interface G 0 1 switch port mode trunk switch port no negotiate
220.941314
okay next interface range F 0 1 - 2 switch port mode access switch port no negotiate
230.474147
okay that's all for step 1
232.922126
step 2 is to assign the pcs to the correct VLANs
238.868814
pc1 & pc2 should be in VLAN 13 and PC 2 and PC 4 should be in VLAN 24
246.205646
I'm on switched 2 now so let's assign PC 3 and PC 4 to the correct VLANs
252.199000
interface F 0 1 switch port access VLAN 13 interface F 0 2 switch port access VLAN 24
264.020291
now let's go back to switch 1
266.739895
interface f01 switch port access VLAN 13 interface f02 switch for access VLAN 24
278.500749
okay we have assigned the PCs to the correct VLANs
284.480728
r1 has already been configured for inter VLAN routing
288.682457
let's just check the configuration
290.232352
enable show run the gig 0/0 interface itself has no IP address but I've configured two sub interfaces one for each VLAN
303.688913
the encapsulation dot1q command sets the VLAN of the sub interface thirteen and fourteen and then we set the IP address for the sub interface
313.852413
make sure these addresses are set as the default gateways for the pcs
318.733100
I already configure the pcs so everything should work fine now
323.125808
let's try some pings from pc1 to make sure we have connectivity
327.495579
let's ping PC three first which is in the same VLAN but connected to a different switch
334.569474
pink 13.0.0.13 it works okay and now let's ping PC 2
347.218328
which is in a different VLAN but connected to the same switch
351.111182
ping 24.0.0.12
355.153202
it works so our inter VLAN routing is working
364.142618
let's try to ping PC 4 as well
366.816055
in a different VLAN and connected to a different switch
370.232034
ping 24.0.0.14 it works too
379.994575
in this lab we took a brief look at DTP disabled it and configured VLANs and switch port mode
388.890970
that's all for this lab
