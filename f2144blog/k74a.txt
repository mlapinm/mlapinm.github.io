welcome to this free gns3 lab for the CCNA
4.116979
once again because packet tracer doesn't support all of the features necessary for CCNA studies
11.004312
I have chosen to do this lab in gns3
14.042499
rather than just skip the topic
16.053374
you can download the lab file from the link in the description
19.863707
however you will also need the Cisco IOS image to use for these routers
24.847978
I will include the name of the iOS image I used in the description
29.970415
however I cannot legally distribute the file itself
33.030707
if you like these labs please consider supporting me if you have my patreon or the cryptocurrency options in the description

in this short lab we will look at IP SLA
54.541894
SLA stands for service level agreement
58.295165
what is an SLA
60.342831
it's an agreement between a service provider and a client
64.248497
for example a guarantee of latency or internet speed
69.041435
you can configure various IP SLA operations in Cisco IOS
74.327289
however for the CCNA you just have to be familiar with the ICMP echo operation
80.663956
aka ping
81.705476
the ICMP echo operation sends pings at regular intervals
86.891017
and keeps a count of how many succeed and how many fail
90.446580
let's get started
91.975413
let's hop on our one
95.286184
I will configure the ICMP echo operation to send pings to our two
100.252121
coughed II use the following command
104.473267
IP SLA followed by the operation number
108.828517
you can configure multiple IP SLA operations on the same device
113.709079
so a number is necessary to identify them
116.848892
I'll use one
118.257683
and then there are no more options
120.781579
now I'm in IP SLA configuration mode
124.250787
let's check the options
127.021642
as you can see there are various kinds of operations that we can use
131.532975
let's configure an ICM a cooperation
134.711579
and then enter the destination address of 12.0.0.2
140.178141
okay now I'm brought into IPS la Echo configuration mode
145.785245
again there are plenty of options here but let's just specify the frequency
151.328849
which is how often the pings will be sent to our -
154.298016
the instructions say to use a frequency of five
158.072016
so frequency five
160.485766
that's it
161.725307
now we have to schedule the operation
165.517891
that is done in global configuration mode
168.522932
exit once again the command starts with IP SLA
174.644849
this time followed by schedule and the operation number one
179.565078
next let's specify the start time
183.324016
we could configure it to start after ten minutes for example or start at a specific time like 12 o'clock for example
192.941766
but let's schedule it to start now
196.085724
next let's specify the life
200.258911
which is how long we want the operation to continue
203.059974
the instructions say to schedule it to continue until manually stopped
207.887286
so let's use the forever option
210.487411
r1 will continue sending pings forever
214.245765
until we remove that configuration
216.477640
okay that's all there is to the configuration
221.265411
there are two main parts
224.293765
configuring the operation and scheduling the operation
228.224786
let's confirm our configuration
231.896453
exit show IP SLA configuration
236.404474
there is entry number one
239.657474
it's type is ICMP echo
243.426245
and there's the target of 12.0.0.2
247.426495
also a frequency of five start time already passed
253.172932
since we configure its start time now
255.273265
and also life forever
258.210182
now let's check the IP SLA statistics
262.139245
to see how many things were successful
264.249078
show IP SLA status dicks
268.382474
there's the number of successes
271.460932
and if I wait for a few seconds
274.448203
and then enter the command again
276.719057
the number should increase
278.407890
show IP SLA statistics
283.952244
there you can see that the number has increased
287.034389
because pings are being sent every five seconds
289.769848
also notice the latest RTT appear
294.780681
that's the latest round-trip time
297.476139
which is how long the ping took to go to r2 and come back
301.748452
now let's shut down our twos g00 interface
306.337389
and then the number of failures should start increasing
309.391723
compte
312.652327
interface g00 shutdown
316.735410
now let's go back on our one
319.693347
i'll wait 10 seconds or so to let a few pings be sent
324.800305
okay let's check
338.025972
show IP SLA statistics
341.536180
as you can see the number of failures has started increasing
346.124263
and the latest RTT indicates no connection busy or time out
352.013408
let's enable our 2's g00 interface now
355.863763
no shutdown
359.026742
okay now all wait 10 seconds or so again to let a few more pings be sent from r1 to r2
365.575054
okay now let's check the IP SLA statistics once more on our one
380.129471
the number of successes should have increased
383.226242
and we should see a normal latest RTT value
387.477867
show IP SLA statistics
391.105783
there we go the pings are working again
395.267033
that's all for this lab
397.108533
