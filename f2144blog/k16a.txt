in this lab we will configure loopback interfaces on two routers r1 and r2
16.736868
loopback interfaces are logical interfaces
21.021283
meaning that they are not interfaces that physically exist on the router
25.486237
they can be used for testing purposes among others
29.353279
another important characteristic is that a loopback interface never goes down unlike a physical interface which can fail
37.153608
loopback interfaces are something we'll be using a lot in future labs
42.241351
so I want to use this simple lab to introduce them
45.566424
try to complete the lab on your own first
48.590203
then continue watching this video if you have trouble or watch it after to check your solution
54.434513
step one is to set the IP addresses of the interfaces connecting the two routers and to enable them
65.914952
let's hop on r1 first
68.821056
enable conf t both routers are connected using their gig 0 0 interfaces
78.500477
so interface gig 0 0
82.320225
now let's set the IP address
85.547967
IP address 192.168.1.1
89.825134
with the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0
95.188923
ok now we have to enable the interface
98.369577
no shutdown
100.217359
there we go our one is done
102.460883
now let's go to r2
104.368105
enable conf t interface g00 IP address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
120.277656
no shut ok let's ping to check
125.013648
do ping 192.168.1.1 the ping works
134.011035
step 2 is to create a loopback interface on each router 1.1.1.1 & 2.2.2.2
145.198528
they should each use a / 32 subnet mask
149.524752
which is equivalent to 255 255 255 255
155.119661
ok let's go on r1 to create a loopback interface just enter interface configuration mode for the loopback interface
165.474578
interface loopback 0
168.678192
note that you can shorten it to interface l0
172.568854
so we have now created the loopback interface
175.992272
the loopback interface is up by default and will never go down
180.488595
however you can still issue the shutdown command to administrative lead issei belit
185.366319
now let's set the IP address
188.799318
IP address 1.1 1.1 255 255 255 255
196.28518
ok now let's go on r2
198.790761
interface l0 IP address 2 2 2 2 255 255 255 255
210.886671
we have successfully created a loopback interface on each device
215.366654
step three is to ping both the local loopback interface and the loopback interface of the remote device from each router
225.88773
the router should be able to ping its own loopback interface with no issues by default
231.290868
however it has no way of knowing about the loopback interface of the remote router by default
236.363551
the routers can pin each other's physical interfaces because they are part of a connected network which they share
243.846666
however the loopback interfaces are on separate networks
247.661056
because we haven't done any labs for IP ropes yet I pre-configured static routes on each router beforehand
254.864724
this isn't a topic for this lab but let me show you the IP route table
260.733203
let me hop on r1
263.337018
and show IP route
267.95312
you see here the C indicating connected of the 192.168.1.0 Network
276.116495
and the l indicating local of the 192.168.1.1 address configured on the gig 0/0 interface
283.292259
above that is an S indicating static
287.648635
this is the route I pre-configured to the loopback of r2
291.874642
also at the top is the loopback here on r1
296.107289
now let's try the pings which both should be successful
300.727298
first the local loopback
303.94082
ping 1.1.1.1 it works
310.722019
now our twos ping 2.2.2.2
315.089141
it works as well
317.140025
now let's do the same on r2
320.332206
end ping 2.2.2.2 it works
328.234023
ping 1.1.1.1 it works as well
335.025811
step four is to remove the loopback interfaces
342.98689
this is just to point out a difference between physical interfaces and loopback interfaces
348.310591
you can't delete a physical interface using the command line
352.686503
let's confirm that
354.160709
first on our two conf T no interface G zero zero
361.269642
we get the message removal of physical interfaces is not permitted
366.150851
now let's do the same thing ad no in front of the interface command for loopback zero
372.220037
first however let's use the do show IP interface brief command
377.316643
there is gig zero zero which we were unable to delete before and loopback zero
384.724192
now let's try to delete it
386.868471
no interface l0
390.283007
do show IP interface brief
393.495554
as you can see we are able to delete loopback interfaces and loop X zero is no longer listed here
400.971342
let's do the same on r1
403.806206
show IP interface brief there's loopback zero
409.602943
conf t no interface l0
414.459122
do show IP interface brief
417.7599
we have successfully removed the loopback interface of each router
422.086975
that's all for this lab
