in this lab we will look a bit more at CDP cisco discovery protocol
14.235583
this should be a fairly short lab looking at one more CDP command which we didn't cover in the last lab
20.598249
we will use CDP to identify more detailed information about neighboring devices beyond that displayed in the show CDP neighbors command
29.741582
step one is to use CDP to identify which interfaces are used to connect the routers and switches
38.560644
we've done this in previous labs so this should be no problem
42.684478
let's go on switch one first
45.119582
enable show CDP neighbors
51.100394
as you can see switch 1 is connected to r1 via the gigabit ethernet zero one interface
57.684914
and it's also connected to our ones gigabit ethernet zero one interface
61.944247
next let's go to r1
64.678059
enable show CDP neighbors
70.755205
r1 is connected to switch 1 via the gigabit ethernet zero one interface as we just saw
77.650601
it's also connected to r2 via the gigabit ethernet 0 0 interface
82.501143
connected to our two's Gigabit Ethernet 0 0 interface
86.281143
next let's go on to r2
91.343372
enable show CDP neighbors
97.008726
as we just saw it's connected to r1 via the gigabit ethernet 0 0 interface
103.660372
and it's connected to switch to via the gigabit ethernet 0 1 interface
108.54483
connected to switch 2 is Gigabit Ethernet 0 1 interface
111.692913
next let's go on switch to to confirm
115.349017
enable shows CDP neighbors
120.85335
as you can see it is indeed connected to r2 via the gigabit ethernet 0 1 interface
126.926309
that's all for step 1
128.851184
step2 actually doesn't require any new commands
136.282642
I just want to point out something I didn't identify in the previous lab
139.994475
let's look back at switch 1
142.690684
in the results of the show CDP neighbors command there is a platform column
148.530975
what does that identify
150.313704
it's the hardware model of the neighboring device
153.312266
in this case r1 is a C 1900 series router
157.84012
let's go on r1 to identify switch 1 and R 2
161.850078
so R 2 is a C 2900 series router and switch 1 is a 2960 series switch
170.821766
finally let's go on r2 to identify the model of its neighbor switch 2
176.007682
as you can see it is a 3560 model switch
181.728766
and if you remember the icon used to represent it here in packet tracer
186.01037
means it is a multi-layer switch
188.261536
multi-layer switches will be a topic for later labs
192.056973
finally step three requires a new command which we didn't cover in previous labs
200.92891
actually there are two options
203.79493
we have to identify the iOS version of the neighboring devices
207.882451
note that you can do this on the device itself with the show version command
212.791222
however for practice let's use CDP to find this information
216.867118
let's go on switch one
219.819263
now one option is the command show CDP neighbors detail
225.603326
clearly this gives more information than the standard show CDP neighbors command
232.267367
in this case switch one has only one neighbor
236.278201
but if a device has many neighbors this command gives information for every neighbor which can be overwhelming
242.405326
if you want to view detailed information about just one device use this command
248.334909
show CDP entry followed by the name of the neighboring device in this case r1
255.409721
this displays the same information just for the specified device
260.730721
now you can find the iOS version of r1 here
264.63595
it's 15.144
268.465637
now let's go on r1
270.726053
show CDP entry switch one switch
276.067282
run is running version 12.25 FX
281.411011
let's also check our ones other neighbor R 2
285.396302
show CDP entry r2
288.540552
r2 is running 15.144
292.942072
same as r1
294.324613
finally let's go on r2 to find the version of switch 2
298.287175
show CDP entry switch 2
302.833612
switch 2 is running version 12.21
308.484591
now as a bonus I'd like to also demonstrate the show version command I briefly mentioned before
317.53407
this gives a lot of information about the device
320.81534
but for now let's just confirm the iOS versions we learned about via CDP
325.26659
on switch 1 first
327.321277
show version as you can see there's a lot of info here
334.167547
I recommend looking through it to familiarize yourself with what's here
337.788777
but let's just check the iOS version as I said
341.11611
switch 1 is running 12 point to 25 FX
345.686777
which is the same as we saw from CDP on our one
348.673402
next let's go to our one
351.712339
show version our one is running version 15 point 1 4 & 4
359.099568
same as we saw from CDP again
361.590172
next are 2
364.925277
show version
367.469527
r2 is running version 15 point 1 for M for same as our 1
373.459777
finally switch 2
376.648235
show version
379.929068
it's running version 12 point to one
383.768526
that's all for this lab
