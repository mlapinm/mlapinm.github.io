in this lab we will troubleshoot the topology we configured in the previous lab
24.506727
several miss configurations are preventing our ether channels from operating as intended
29.456997
let's troubleshoot the errors and fix them
32.176601
first let's take a look at switch 1
36.325726
enable show ether channel summary
41.739809
so we have port channel 1 configured and it's layer 2 however it is down as this D indicates
49.090412
the eye next to the interfaces indicates standalone meaning they aren't properly paired with interfaces on switch 2 to make the ether channel
57.416412
however you should be able to spot the problem here
61.364287
the ether channel between switch 1 and switch 2 is supposed to be using pagp not LACP
68.895391
that could be why switch 1 and switch 2 aren't successfully forming either channel
73.563391
let's change that
75.461786
conf t interface range f 0 1 through 4 no channel group 1
83.626681
also just to be safe I'll delete the port channel interface as well
88.171889
no interface po1
90.806118
okay let's reconfigure that
93.506784
interface range F 0 1 through 4 channel Group 1 mode desirable
100.191264
do show ether channel summary
103.576201
ok our port channel is working
108.199242
however F 0 1 is down
111.151117
let's see what's up on switch 2
113.863804
enable show ether channel summary
118.875866
F 0 4 which is connected to switch ones F 0 1 is down as well
124.959929
remember in the previous video I said port speed duplex etc had to match for the ether channel to work
133.107491
when one interface isn't properly joining the port channel
136.274824
one of those things could be the problem
138.773011
show interface f0 4
143.313469
full duplex 10 megabits per second
146.725594
let's check other interfaces
150.126052
show interface f03 full duplex a hundred megabits per second
155.859198
show interface f0 2
158.626802
again 100 megabits per second
161.501822
show interface F 0 1 100 megabits per second
166.533322
let's also quickly check switch once F 0 1 interface
170.146009
do show interface F 0 1
175.752884
again 100 megabits per second
179.416738
there's a problem the other interfaces are all using a speed of 100 megabits per second
184.662300
let's adjust f0 4 is speed to the same
188.635675
conf t interface f0 for speed 100
196.597466
do show ether channel summary
199.309695
there we go
201.432382
all interfaces now have the PFLAG beside them meaning import channel
205.793216
however notice port channel 1 the ether channel with switch 3 is down
212.952903
gig 0 1 and gig 0 2 don't show up here
216.765256
I'll add them quickly
218.318839
interface range G 0 1 to 2 channel Group 1 mode on
225.721380
do show ether channel summary
229.409859
looks like it's up now let's check on switch 3
234.731984
enable show ether channel summary
239.123692
look at poor channel 1
242.268609
it has the flags s and u
244.963172
s means layer 2 that's not correct it's supposed to be layer 3
250.096255
it's showing you 4 in use here but on switch to its at layer 3 down
256.402900
show IP interface g0 1
259.736795
show IP interface g0 2
262.947940
notice both interfaces state internet protocol processing disabled
269.652169
that means the interface is our layer 2 not layer three
273.766315
and thus the port channel is layer two as well
276.513190
show run indeed the gig zero one and gigs zero two interfaces do not have that no switch port command configured
287.472106
let's configure it conf t interface range G zero one to two
295.740210
no switch port
297.738897
notice the command is rejected
299.995251
switch three is already configured for a layer two ether channel
303.817272
let's undo that configuration and then redo it
306.426334
no channel Group one no interface po1 interface range G zero one to two no switch port channel Group one mode on
322.782230
all so let's give it an IP address
325.790292
interface po1 IP address 23.0.0.2 255.255.255.0
334.939375
do show ether channel summary
337.815895
looks good here
339.779874
it's layer three now let's check once more on switch 2
343.748624
do show ether channel summary
348.480061
ok it looks good here
351.151102
let's do one last check do ping 23.0.0.2
357.128748
okay it looks good we can ping switch threes end of the ether channel
364.134373
now let's go back to switch 3
368.014935
notice the port channel with switch 4 is down
373.287873
all of the interfaces have the standalone flag
376.425602
let's take a look at the configuration
379.453227
do show run
382.367352
channel group 2 mode passive
385.895581
ok now let's look at switch 4
388.836060
enable show ether channel summary
394.309164
same thing here
395.973102
show run okay here's our problem
402.198268
both switches are in LACP passive mode
405.605914
passive mode and passive mode won't form an ether channel
409.716581
at least one side has to be active
411.934768
let's make switch for active and see if that solves the problem
415.594122
conf t interface range F 0 1 through 4 channel Group 1 mode active
425.673247
do show ether channel summary
429.085122
there we go the port channel is up and all interfaces have the import channel flag
435.865913
let's confirm on switch 3 as well
438.823122
do show ether channel summary
442.965559
okay looks good
445.432246
we have fixed all of the problems with our ether channels
448.458329
