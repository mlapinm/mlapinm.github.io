welcome to this free CCNA packet tracer practice lab you can download the lab file from the link in the description

if you like these labs please consider supporting me via my patreon or the cryptocurrency options in the description 15.38991 this will be a short lab focused on using telnet to connect to Cisco devices
21.108425
in a previous lab we configured the console port and use that to connect to a router via PC
27.400059
in this lab we will use telnet which allows us to configure a Cisco device by connecting via a regular Ethernet port
35.221511
note that although telnet is something you should be familiar with
40.435432
it is not something you will likely end up using due to a lack of security 44.50743 this is because telnet sends all data in plaintext
49.260411
if anyone intercepts that data they can read it including usernames and passwords and other sensitive data
56.571148
instead of telnet you will want to use SSH
60.599827
which we will cover in another lab
62.416328
but with that said telnet is still something you should know
65.912487
so let's practice some of the basics in this lab
68.570006
as always try to complete the lab yourself first then continue watching this video if you have trouble
75.355148
or watch it after to check your solution
77.266705
if you haven't learned the commands required to do these tasks yet in your studies
82.360548
feel free to just watch the video to learn them
84.955112
step one is to configure the IP addresses on switch 1 and R 1
92.530769
we will then use these addresses to connect to the devices later in the lab
96.696031
let's go on switch 1 first 99.35214 enable conf t we will configure the IP address on the VLAN 1 interface
108.153922
because a regular switch interface cannot be configured with an IP address
113.021492
we have to configure that IP address we use to manage the device on a VLAN interface
118.481674
rather than on a physical interface
120.308253
so interface VLAN 1
123.804294
IP address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0
131.271763
also I'll use no shutdown to activate it
134.914793
now let's configure r1
137.600192
enable conf t interface G 0 0 IP address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 152.16748 remember router interfaces are administratively down by default so no shutdown
158.530171
okay that's all for step 1
160.685924
step 2 is to configure a single user on each device 165.49378 since we're on our one let's do that first
168.300749
exit username cisco password CCNA
173.869935
note again that passwords are case sensitive and in this case CCNA is in all capitals 179.75098 now let's do the same on switch one
183.000866
exit username cisco password CCNA
189.344313
step three is to configure the vty lines on switch 1 and R 1
198.932286
vty stands for virtual teletype
203.107727
and when you create a telnet connection to a Cisco device you will be connecting to one of these vty lines
208.991201
there are typically 16 numbered 0 through 15
213.526021
although in the running configuration they will typically be displayed as 0 through 4 then 5 through 15 220.90624 let's check on switch 1
223.427913
do show run
226.382301
scroll down to the bottom there we go
230.841299
line vty 0 4 meaning line 0 through 4 then line vty 5 15 meaning alliance 5 through 15 240.39852 although it is displayed like this in the configuration
244.030005
we can simply use the command line vty 0 15 to connect to all lines from 0 through 15
252.053253
there we go
253.009129
now we have two things to configure here according to the lab instructions
257.815142
first require the use of the local user database to connect to the vty lines 263.91313 this is the same command we used when configuring the console line in a previous lab
268.818122
login local since we only have one user in the local database
275.411018
we will have to use the username cisco and password CCNA
279.158465
when we try to tell that to this device later
281.495375
the next requirement is to allow only telnet connections to the vty lines
287.676082
this is done with this command
290.189487
transport input now I'll use the question mark to see what options there are all none SSH and telnet
301.482797
as I mentioned in the beginning of the video typically you'll be using SSH
306.921203
but let's set it to telnet for this lab
309.487609
ok now let's do the same configuration on r1
315.315704
line vty 0 15 login local transport input telnet
324.852266
okay now let's type do show run
328.554691
look at the bottom here
331.250855
there it is our configurations have been applied to all vty lines
335.783539
step four is to attempt to telnet to each device from pc1 on a simulator like packet tracer you simply click on the icons of each device to configure them
349.020015
in real situations however you have to connect to the devices from a computer via the console port as we did in a previous lab or by telnet or SSH
358.528029
as we're going to try now 360.0355 I'll go on PC one
363.228386
let's try switch one
366.614327
telnet 192.168.1.2 we're asked for the username which is Cisco and our password CCNA in all caps
378.796651
there we go
380.734979
now we have access to the command line of switch one 383.18897 I'll type exit and now let's try our one
387.866871
telnet 192.168.1.1 cisco CCNA
396.242976
there we go now we have access to the command line of r1
399.767366
that's all for this lab
