in this lab we are going to continue with what we learned in the previous lab
19.581071
in this lab however there are now four routers and there are a lot more static routes that need to be configured
25.348485
try to complete the lab yourself first then continue watching if you have trouble
29.600317
or watch it after to check your solution
32.150724
so in the previous video I mentioned that as a network gets larger it becomes unfeasible to configure primary and backup routes to each destination manually
42.004611
in this lab we aren't even going to configure backup routes and just by adding a few extra routers the amount of static routes to be configured has increased quite a bit
50.979889
so exactly how many routes will we have to configure
55.867913
well let's look at r1
58.280632
it is directly connected to three networks
61.107218
10.0.1.0 slash 24 192.168 12.0 slash 24 and 192.168.13.0 slash 24
71.472215
so we don't have to configure routes to these networks
74.327514
that means we will have to configure routes 2 192.168 24 0/24 192.168.44.0 slash 24 1.2 slash 24 1.0.0.30 slash 24 and 10.0.2.4 slash 24
87.119738
so we will have to configure five static routes on r1
97.351694
we will have to configure the same number of routes on each other router
102.233623
so that's a total of 20 static routes
104.860202
on the scale of things that's not a huge number of routes to configure
109.039116
however compared to the two routes we had to configure in the previous lab it's quite a jump
113.741815
this is still a very small and simple network 2 on the scale of things
118.240063
this lab will be quite repetitive but also good practice
122.048361
be careful of misconfigurations when doing repetitive work like this
126.477550
I'll of course be careful too but if you spot any mistakes I'll give you a shout out in another video
131.549834
anyway let's get started
139.550672
I'll hop on r1 enable conf T
146.625182
so let's create the static routes we mentioned before
149.347133
IP route 192.168.24.0 255.255.255.0 with the next top of 192.168.12.2 which is r2
163.093005
IP route 192.168.34.0 255.255.255.0 with the next top of
171.907116
192.168.13.3 which is r 3
176.213018
IP route 10.0.3.0 255.255.255.0
182.652949
192.168.13.3 again r 3 is the next hop
186.791338
IP route 10.0.2.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.2
196.229225
next top of r 2
197.985599
IP route 10.0.4.0 255.255.255.0
204.607990
now this one we have a choice
207.202773
there are two routes of equal distance
209.644596
we could go R 2 to R 4 or via R 3 to R 4
214.504781
let's go with r 2 is the next hop
216.507575
so 192.168.12.2 ok R 1 is now complete
221.802815
now let's go on r2 and configure the required routes
227.553830
those being 192.168.13.0 slash 24 192.168.24.0 /24 10.0.1.0 slash 24 10.0.3.0 slash 24 and 10.0.4.0 slash 24
242.615643
enable conf t IP route 192.168.13.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.1
255.553505
r1 is the next hop
257.623651
IP route 192.168.13.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.24.0 r4 is the next hop
268.632008
IP route 10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.1 r1 is the next hop
280.527672
IP route 10.0.3.0 255.255.255.0
287.448466
again we can choose between two equal distance routes
291.423346
R 1 to R 3 or R 4 to R 3
294.845849
let's go with r1 so
296.678226
192.168.12.1
299.400461
IP route 10.0.4.0 255.255.255.0
306.155989
192.168.24.4 r 4 is the next hop
311.179382
that's all for r2
312.984300
now let's configure the routes for r3
317.767177
r3 requires routes to 192.168.12.0 / 24
323.271073
192.168.24.0/24 10.0.1.0 / 24
329.865999
10.0.2.0 / 24 and 10.0.4.0 / 24
335.374369
enable conf t IP route 192.168.12.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.1 r1 is the next hop
351.390743
IP route 192.168.24.0 255.255.255.0
358.078388
192.168.24.4 r4 is the next hop
362.745258
IP route 10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.1
372.109832
r1 is the next hop
373.876237
IP route 10.0.2.0 255.255.255.0
380.062221
again we have a choice here
381.882294
I'll set r1 as the next hop 192.168.13.1 I P route 10.0.4.0 255 255 255 0
393.151656
192.168.34.4 r 4 is the next hop
398.428112
that's all for r3
400.167771
finally let's configure static routes on r4
405.881673
r4's routes to 192.168.12.0 /24 192.168.13.0 / 24
414.415365
10.0.1.0 / 24
417.615339
10.0.2.0 / 24 and 10.0.3.0 / 24
423.075646
enable conf t IP routs 192.168.12.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.24.2
436.996042
r 2 is the next hop
438.516636
IP route - 192.168.13.0 255.255.255.0
445.434681
192.168.24.3 r 3 is the next hop
450.336600
IP route 10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0
456.739621
we have a choice here between two equal distance routes
460.122395
but let's go with r2
461.929505
so 192.168.24.2 IP routes 10.0.2.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.24.2
473.558838
r 2 is the next hop and last one IP route 10.0.3.0 255.255.255.0
482.572675
192.168.34.3
485.552445
r 3 is the next hop
487.629827
that's all for r 4 ok I hope that didn't put you to sleep
494.372724
but I also hope it helped you practice configuring static routes
497.873956
we will do one more lab dedicated to static routing
501.144918
focusing on the creation of backup routes that's all for this lab
