welcome to this free Cisco CCNA packet tracer practice lab 5.71078 you can download the lab file from the link in the description
8.984527
see if you can complete the lab yourself first
13.143932
and then continue watching this video if you have any trouble 15.98083 or watch it afterwards to check your solution
18.800988
in this lab we will be working with two routers r1 and r2
26.869218
we will configure basic security on the routers by using the enable password which is used to enter privileged exec mode also known as enable mode
38.439468
I will only work with one of the routers in this video for the sake of time 43.2369 but I highly recommend that you perform the configurations on both of the routers for practice
49.425341
repetition is essential to become familiar with the command-line interface or CLI
54.978542
step one is to connect the two routers by their Gigabit Ethernet 0 0 interfaces
66.483025
I will refer to these as the gig 0 0 interfaces
71.349879
click on connections in the bottom left
74.748849
and select the cable connected to the gig 0 0 interface on r1 and then r2
82.948591
there we have it step one is complete
86.914912
step two is to set the host names according to the network diagram
96.296489
that is to r1 and r2
98.657359
click on each router and then select CLI to access the command-line interface from which we will configure each router
106.811349
the current host name for each router is displayed here
111.044964
as you can see each router is currently named router
115.359068
to change the host name of a router we must enter global configuration mode
121.062605
however to get there we must first enter privileged exec mode
125.812091
this is achieved by using the enable command
129.560357
to demonstrate a shortcut I will use the exit command to return to the previous exec mode
136.567287
notice that you can enter privileged exec mode by simply typing en
142.528383
you can also type en and then use tab to autocomplete it to enable
148.283737
but this isn't necessary en alone is fine
152.286667
e however is too short
155.843063
and we are told this is an ambiguous command
158.807745
this is because there are other potential commands that begin with E
163.438917
which we can see by typing E and then a question mark 167.41218 as you can see there are two potential commands enable and exit 173.20304 so if you just enter E the router doesn't know which command you mean
178.511168
however enable is the only command beginning with en
183.078884
so en is all the router needs to know which command you mean
187.293586
now that we are in privileged exec mode
191.265524
we can use the configure terminal command to get to global configuration mode
196.490612
if you want to use shortcuts again as we did with enable and en the shortest version of the configure terminal command is conf t
206.589185
from here we can set the hostname of the router
209.466962
this is done with the hostname command
212.633743
I will enter hostname r1
215.421597
as you can see the hostname has changed from router to r1
220.214119
change the hostname on r2 as well
223.111688
and step two is complete
225.434294
step three is to set the enable password on each router to Cisco
235.417132
the enable password is used to enter privileged exec mode which as I mentioned before is also called enable mode
243.525971
previously we had no password set
246.567062
so we were able to enter privileged exec mode without any password
251.091763
now we are going to protect privileged exec mode so that only administrators can access it
257.828257
the command is simple and it is done in global configuration mode which we are already in
264.527286
type an able password Cisco
268.193335
that's it 269.79656 now let's test it out
274.161426
from here I will use the exit command twice
275.126163
once to bring you back to privileged exec mode and then once again to bring you back to exact mode
281.464435
now I will use the enable command again
286.123771
however this time I am asked for a password
289.254222
the characters do not appear as I type
292.598876
however if I type the password Cisco correctly and press Enter
296.832131
I am brought to privileged exec mode now
299.327753
let's see what happens if I fail to enter the correct password
303.558942
I entered the wrong password once twice and then three times before being rejected for having bad secrets
312.301938
now I will try again with the correct password and I'm in 317.70121 step 3 is now complete
319.576191
step four is simply to view the password in the running configuration
328.413973
the running configuration is the current configuration of the router
332.295558
whether or not you have actually saved it
334.796099
if you turn off the router without saving the running configuration you will lose any changes 340.58297 if you want to keep your changes you will save them to what's called the startup configuration
346.860406
that will be for another lab
348.807184
to view the running configuration use the show running config command from privileged exec mode
355.919352
which we are already in 357.87534 you can abbreviate it to for example SH run
362.475673
enter the command and you can see the password right here with the exact command we used before enable password Cisco
372.238832
step 4 asks if the password is encrypted
377.189393
meaning translated into an unreadable code to protect it from being discovered by people who should not know the password
383.755187
as you can see it is not encrypted it is written in clear text right here Cisco so the answer is no
391.657839
step 4 is now complete
394.587015
step 5 is to enable password encryption on the router
400.922847
we can protect passwords by encrypting them to render them unreadable
405.607194
this is done from global configuration mode with the command service password - encryption
412.512471
I will enter the command and now step 5 is complete
417.102114
step six is to once again view the running-config
425.920834
I will use the same command as before
429.500638
and now let's check the password 431.38758 however the command doesn't work
433.878926
that is because we are currently in global configuration mode and show running config must be entered from privileged exec mode
441.360164
now I could type exit to drop back to privileged exec mode and then enter the command 447.17541 but there is one more way
449.309423
if I type do in front of the command
452.021168
I can enter it from global configuration mode
454.476454
do show running config
457.298876
there we go
458.342046
let's look at the password
459.982219
you can see here an able password followed by a seven and then a string of other numbers 465.91831 the password has successfully been encrypted
468.939648
although we didn't type this 7 when we entered the command
472.989782
it refers to the type of encryption used 475.6533 there are other types as well but that's not something to worry about now 479.90062 the string of numbers that follow are the passwords Cisco encrypted to be unreadable 487.49386 so that anyone looking over our shoulder can't read the password
490.509759
keep in mind that the encryption used in the service password encryption command isn't very secure
497.642039
and can be cracked
499.134879
but this at least renders the password safe from someone simply glancing over your shoulder
503.084779
step 6 is complete
505.605702
step seven is to disable password encryption
512.490304
we enabled password encryption with the service password encryption command
516.513226
now we will simply type no followed by the same command
521.711706
no service password encryption
524.744416
that's it step seven is now complete
528.072475
step eight is once again to view the password in the running configuration
534.631315
this time I'll exit down to privileged exec mode
537.799186
and type show running config to view the running configuration
541.169135
as you can see the password is still encrypted
545.147617
why is that even though we disabled password encryption
548.634791
well disabling password encryption will prevent future passwords from being encrypted
554.448517
however it does not unencrypted passwords that are already encrypted
559.012818
so the answer to step eight is yes
561.617975
the password is encrypted
563.608675
step eight in the lab are both now complete
