in this lab we will configure rip version 2 on a network to allow full connectivity
22.278097
this is similar network to the static routing part 2 lab
26.671865
in that lab we had to configure full connectivity with static routes
31.454445
this lab will demonstrate how much simpler it is to do so with the routing protocol
36.045342
I have increased the font size of the CLI in the network diagram due to some comments
41.469296
let me know if the size is good or if it's still difficult to see in the video
44.842341
so currently the devices have all been pre-configured with IP addresses
51.016682
but none of the PC should be able to pin each other because no routing has been configured
56.245834
let's configure rip version 2 on each of these routers
60.190859
on r1 first
62.527533
enable conf t router rip
68.559086
first I'll enable a version 2
72.255245
version 2 it's not necessary for this lab but I'll also disable auto summary
77.919249
which is a good habit
79.433937
no auto
81.167271
r1 is connected to 3 networks 10.0.0.0 12.0.0.0 and 13.0.0.0
90.441407
let's enable rip on each of those interfaces
93.035830
net 10.0.0.0 net 12.0.0.0 net 13.0.0.0
102.805630
now we also have to disable routing updates on interfaces connected to switches
108.534522
g02 in this case
110.945545
we will still advertise the network on the g0 to interface 10.0.0.0 to other routers
117.550208
but because there is no router in this direction it's not necessary to send updates out of this interface
123.211369
and for security purposes it can be a good idea to stop these updates
127.444661
we can do that with this command
129.568268
passive interface g0 2
133.040996
okay that's it
135.174496
let's go on to r2
138.081334
enable conf t router rip
144.921116
version 2 no outo r2 is connected to three networks
151.289706
20.0.0.0 12.0.0.0 and 24.0.0.0
158.100229
so let's configure rip on each of those interfaces
161.747604
net 20.0.0.0 net 12.0.0.0 net 24.0.0.0
171.763249
now let's disable routing updates on g0 2
175.937103
passive interface g0 2
179.209978
that's all for r2
181.410290
now let's move on to r 3 enable conf t router rip version 2 no auto
196.769456
net 30.0.0.0 net 13.0.0.0 net 34.0.0.0 auto passive interface g0 2
211.463226
finally once more on r 4
215.602226
enable conf t router rip version 2 no auto net 40.0.0.0 net 24.0.0.0 net 34.0.0.0
237.771392
passive interface g0 2 ok
243.248121
now let's wait a bit for the routers to send all the routing updates to each other and learn the network
247.257433
this process is called convergence
250.323516
while we're waiting let's check out some stuff on r 4
254.282599
and show IP protocols
258.790724
this is a very handy show command for checking information about whatever routing protocol you are using
264.575453
routing protocol is rip as we configured here you can see the default timers rip
272.373786
remember these especially for the test update timer of 30 seconds invalid and hold-down timers of 180 seconds and flush timer of 240 seconds
284.642265
consult your study materials for detailed explanations of each
289.762473
you can also see information like which interfaces updates are being sent out on
295.368014
notice that the Gigabit Ethernet 0 2 interface isn't here
299.918639
although we can see it is advertising the network down here
303.643680
this is because we made it a passive interface
306.991200
which is indicated here
308.982804
we can also see which neighboring routers we are getting updates from and when we got the last update
315.229220
anyway let's go on PC one now and see if we can ping each other PC
322.467865
ping 20.0.0.10 that's PC 2
330.580093
it works
338.360863
next let's ping pc3
341.091154
ping 30.0.0.10 it works too
352.012425
finally PC for ping 40.0.0.10 it works as well
365.739925
we have successfully configured ripp to allow full connectivity throughout the network
370.454550
that's all for this lab
