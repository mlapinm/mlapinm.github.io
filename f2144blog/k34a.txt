you can download the lab file from the link in the description
8.199957
in this lab we will look at lldp link layer discovery protocol
14.594145
this protocol is very similar to a CDP Cisco discovery protocol which we covered in a couple previous labs
22.333145
CDP however is a cisco proprietary protocol
26.839332
meaning it only works with cisco devices
29.245582
lldp is an open standard protocol and can be used on both cisco devices and devices from other vendors
37.339040
the first step is to disable CDP and enable lldp on each networking device
45.006394
these four devices are Cisco devices
48.688123
so CDP is enabled by default
50.972164
for this lab let's disable CDP and enable lldp on switch one first
58.811705
enable conf t no CDP run lldp run exit
69.564850
that's it pretty simple
71.768079
now r1 enable conf t no CDP run lldp run exit
83.879745
next r2 enable conf t no CDP run lldp run exit finally switch 2
96.682557
enable conf t no CDP run lldp run exit
108.559536
okay so we have disabled CDP and enabled lldp on each networking device
115.691640
let's go back to switch one
118.590848
the next step is to use a show command to find the default timer values for lldp
125.188660
we can do that with this command
127.582098
show lldp the status is active which is what we want and below are the timers
135.692348
the advertisement timer is 30 seconds old timer is 120 seconds and interface re-initialization delay is 2 seconds
146.003202
these are the default timers
148.287181
you might want to remember these for the test especially the advertisement and hold timers
153.496263
next is to use lldp to identify which interfaces are used to connect the networking devices
161.877763
let's use this command on switch 1
165.066367
first show lldp neighbors
169.467742
switch 1 has one neighbor r1
173.189137
the local interface meaning the interface here on switch one is Gigabit Ethernet 1 0 1 and the port ID meaning the interface on r1 is Gigabit Ethernet 0 0
187.726762
let's use the same command on r1
190.783762
show lldp neighbors r1s gig 0 0 interface is connected to switch ones gig 1 0 1 interface
201.898324
which we saw before r1s gig 0 1 interface is connected to r2s gig 0 0 interface
209.614217
ok let's go on r2 now
212.837550
show lldp neighbors
217.630758
as we saw on r1 r2 s gig 0 0 interface is connected to r1s gig 0 1 interface
226.529383
also r2 s gig 0 1 interface is connected to switch2s gig 0 1 interface
233.149194
let's hop on switch 2 to confirm show lldp neighbors
240.777360
there we go switch 2 s gig 0 on interface is connected to r2's gig 0 1 interface
247.899025
the next task is to use lldp to identify the iOS version of each neighboring device
256.089670
let's start here on switch 2
258.994565
to view this information about a neighboring device use this command
263.458960
show lldp neighbors detail
265.908564
you can see the iOS information for r2 here
271.539272
see 2900 software running version 15.144
278.283833
now let's go on r2 show lldp neighbors detail
285.988999
first we can see switch 2 is running see 3560 software version 12.2371
296.857894
also the neighboring r1 is running see 2900 software version 15.144
306.148144
finally let's go on r1 to find the version of switch 1
312.057539
show lldp neighbors detail
317.349268
switch 1 is running catalyst layer 3 switch software version 16.3.2
325.887934
the final step is to prevent switch to sf01 interface which is connected to a pc 1 from sending or receiving lldp updates
338.385746
let's go on switch 2
340.790975
conf t interface f01 to disable lldp reception use this command
351.070391
no lldp receive
354.433016
ok now to turn off lldp transmission no lldp transmitted
361.737995
whereas CDP uses one command CDP enable for both reception and transmission
368.991306
lldps is two separate commands
371.683618
lldp receive and lldp transmit
375.864826
that's all for this lab
