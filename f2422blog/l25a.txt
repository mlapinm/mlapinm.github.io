 1.592992 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial  5.584823 in this video I want to show
you how to import PDF files into
Inkscape 11.409451  so it's actually a really
really cool feature 13.609292  that Inkscape has
built in 15.961005  so if you ever want to edit the
PDF file  18.105073 this is an option you can do it 20.029319 
but pulling elements out of PDF files it
works great for 22.636860  I'll show you sort of
some of the power of it and some of the
shortcomings 26.284973  so I have a PDF file here 27.993732 
and this is just this is actually from
the magpie it's like a Raspberry Pi
magazine  35.629231 that gets released about
Raspberry Pi  38.757512 and microcontrollers anyway 40.597112 
so these are some of the pages of this
PDF 42.654859  and we can see it's just a PDF file
 45.150450 and it's a like a magazine 47.206538  so it's got
pictures it's got text on it 49.446427  but what I
want to do is just drag this in so if I
left click and drag this into Inkscape 55.494286 
it brings up this PDF import window and
it I can only import one page at a time 61.414249 
so I can do page 1 page 2 whatever
whatever page I want to do 64.750009  and I'll show
them what that page looks like 66.731837  and then
give me some different options for
importing it  68.699239 so I'm just going to do the
first page this is like oh this is
actually the cover of the magazine 73.947093  and
then these import settings 76.616111  I'm gonna
leave everything how it is  78.216475 but for
example it says replace PDF fonts by the
closest name to installed fonts 82.873569  so one
thing is this PDF has fonts that it uses
and I guess 88.441591  they weren't maybe they're
embedded maybe they're not I'm not sure
about that  92.197511 but if they're not embedded
then my I have to have those fonts on my
computer or it's gonna look weird and I
don't have them so we'll see it'll look
a little weird 100.614698  so I'm just hit OK right
now  102.017534 and it's going to bring this in 104.877690  and
so we can see right off if I hit the
plus sign and zoom in a little bit 108.403729  it
looks a little different than it does
here  111.090731 so this is the original viewing it
in the PDF  113.898839 and that's what it looks like
over here so we see some of these fonts
are a little different  118.778862 this actually
doesn't look too bad maybe this is an
image  121.308252 but looks the fonts up here for
example  122.943916 where it says all-new raspberry
pie getting started up here it's
different  127.131929 it's like although it's
running together because it's using a
different text 130.184279 
but that being said if I select the
whole thing and I ungroup it  136.103812 so we go to
have you ungroup from here object 138.899919  and
ungroup or you can do ctrl shift G 141.547979  and
now everything's a separate object I can
grab and move around just this raspberry 147.188000 
just this text we can grab just this
text here 151.176237  and I can actually edit this
text too  153.575965 so if I want to edit like this
here and we want to call it something
else  155.923807 we can do that 157.688154  but it's doing a
little bit weird here  159.695920 but we can delete
it we can take this board here  163.892642 and move
it and see just what this picture looks
like  166.623891 so it's actually pretty cool we can
take the ISBN number  169.224473 and kind of move it
around -  173.820040 pretty awesome huh so anyway 176.564176 
this is a way that you can edit and it's
not perfect as you saw there when I
tried to edit if I try to edit this text 181.412160 
here it was let's zoom in  185.544325 if I try to
edit like these numbers they're gonna
edit like one at a time if I hit the
backspace it just erases the zero my
cursor stays here 191.356762  so that's kind of one
shortcoming you can kind of play around
with that and see text is not gonna be
perfect in this 197.552274  but these things are
like this I'm not this is it if I could
i can ungroup this thing probably so
this is actually a vector image 204.745165  and we
can get real down in here it's changed
if I want to change the colors of these
leaves  

210.555967 I can select both of them change
it to like blue  212.864215 or change it to change
it up a little bit  216.515485 so it's really cool 218.443854 
you can actually pull in objects from
PDFs and edit them using Inkscape 222.115478  and
that's really what i all I wanted to
show with this 224.483205  and then if you want to
have the fonts show correctly just make
sure that you have that font installed
on your computer 231.223092 
hopefully found this informative go
ahead and play around you're gonna find
out the different PDFs  236.485882 import
differently some it depends on how that
PDF was made sometimes you're gonna be
able to grab every little object 242.742029 
sometimes you're not and it's all just
going to be one picture sometimes the
fonts will actually or the text will
actually be a picture  250.155343 so you can't
actually get an edit like this case here 253.135445 
oh well this one this one is a picture 255.555290 
but so we can't get in and edit this
letter  257.915339 it's actually a path  260.287561 see that so
it's not a font M it's actually a path 263.843501 
so different different objects different
paths are going to have different
properties within every PDF but go ahead
and download some PDFs and play with it
dragging and dropping in there  273.051253 and yeah
I get familiar with it I'm sure you'll
find some uses I've used this a ton I've
brought in like construction documents
for example for like estimating I bring
in like a floor plan of a house 285.240331  and I
can like click and make notes do
different things to that floor plan
anyway  291.423249 thanks for watching and 293.743191  catch you
on the next video 296.571263  296.571263  296.571263
