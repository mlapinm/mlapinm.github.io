 1.894420 welcome to this tutorial teaching how to
create simple buttons using Inkscape 6.930559 
I want to thank user Darien Miller for
reminding me to create this tutorial 10.983274 
buttons are actually really easy to make
it just creates kind of an illusion but
they're actually very simple 16.288039  and so I'm
just going to show you how I created
these ones here we'll just come over 20.008231  and
first i'ma what I like to do if I have
text in it I have to create my text
first  25.740960 so I'll just type in like download
if we're gonna do a download button 29.701238  and
then we'll get the size  30.439486 we want I want
to make sure this lock is selected here 33.479573 
so that when I scale this 34.666547  it's scales
proportionally on the X&Y so it doesn't
get too distorted  38.211677 so now that I know the
size of the button I need to make 41.590507  I'll
just draw a box around it  43.195708 so I'll select
this rectangle tool  44.972010 I'll left-click 46.217229  and
draw a box around oh and probably by
default yours might be just completely
square  51.081056 so to round those edges out we'll
just click on this circle well we double
click first on the we double click on
the square to get that option 57.739316  then we'll
round those corners down to about where
we want 61.256606  we don't have to have a round
button  62.482429 but it's you know it makes it
look kind of nice 64.840967  and then we notice
it's the same color as our text so we'll
just change this to a different color
maybe we'll do like an orange button
like this  71.474274 and then we'll lower it all
the way down to the bottom so our text
is on top  75.072995 and I noticed it's a little
bit for some reason we have something
going on here in our fill and stroke our
opacity was down a little bit so now
it's up 100% 84.572954  and now it's nice to get
under object we go to align and
distribute  88.722405 and bring up these tools
because it's we can drag and kind of get
this centered 92.931477  but the best thing to do
is select both of these 95.092902  and then we will
just click here to Center it along the
y-axis 99.797177  and then Center it along the
x-axis  102.434230 here and so we have this nice
centered text 105.471525  and then the only thing we
really need to do but we can change the
color if we want of the  109.470144 the font in fact
this one will do a little bit white and
I'll show you how to bring that out a
little bit more  113.340942 but the only thing we do
to give it sort of this 3d look like
this  116.778531 one has this little glow on top 118.784880 
this is actually just a it's a rectangle  
I think with our white gradient on it  126.542082 so
for this we just go control well we can
just draw let's just grab the rectangle
tool  130.903016 we'll just draw a rectangle right
on top here
in white or whatever color it is just
make sure we make it white 136.364777  and then all
we have to do is get it to bow the
position we want about like there 141.204524  grab
the gradient tool right here and
left-click on the top and just bring
down that gradient  146.126188 so now we have a nice
kind of white gradient we'll get it to a
point that looks pretty good for us 151.932896  and
it's sort of like strange when you're
first doing it it looks a little bit
weird  156.106003 we can actually adjust that a
little bit more to make it mesh  158.742434 so it
kind of fades into it and bring it so
it's a little bit harder white right
there  163.519422 that's probably pretty good  166.114090 and
then so it your eyes kind of kind of
trick and change it when you zoom out
here  171.656923 it just looks like it has like a
light up here shining down on top of it 175.624620 
sometimes I like to draw a background
and put it so if it's is gonna be like
on a web page with a gray background 181.240780 
sometimes I like to put a background on
it just so I can see like how it'll look
in different different environments 187.071317 
maybe it'll be if it looks gonna be on
black you can kind of see how it's gonna
look  190.950042 and I told you I'd make that stand
out a little bit more to this text  193.668854 if we
click on the text we can go ctrl D to
duplicate this text so we have two
copies now 199.355276  I'll put ctrl Z to put it
back where it was  202.066077 if I turn it sometimes
I turn it like a black and I'll go push
it down error on the keyboard a little
bit  207.953985 and then over to the right a little
bit  210.014942 and give it sort of a drop shadow 211.892590 
then I'll just drop this down 213.574150  so it's
kind of behind it there 215.479357  and so now we
see we have this drop shadow  217.503395 you could
keep it have to have a hard line like
that if you want  220.154335 and it makes that text
look a little bit more pronounced 223.553106  you
can also holding alt we can click and
select again that black text 228.795406  we could
also come over here to the fill and
stroke 232.169948  and give that a little bit of a
blur  234.779373 see that and that just kind of
makes it so it's not so sharp and it's
just sort of blurry but it still makes
that stand out that text stand out a
little bit 242.406374  you can also grab these we
can go ctrl D and duplicate 246.738094  sometimes
you'll want to grab this and we can even
like rotate it around  249.647270 and give it back
one on the top one on the bottom 252.804685  and
then or we can change the gradient of
this one a little bit  255.997031 and make it a
little bit different or a little bit
more subtle or something  259.568903 so it's just
like slightly there  261.586263 we can grab the
edges of this and give it a little bit
of a blur as well  266.226497 so it's not as
I don't know if you can mix the two and
make it look good that doesn't look as
good  271.467259 but you can blur this 273.112210  and blurring
that actually gives it a different
effect so I don't think I want to do
that  275.709547 and then the same thing for this
circle when we did the same thing so for
a circle  280.772105 we just come down here and we
draw a circle 283.165651  we left click and hold  285.042696 and
let's make it a color maybe we'll make
this a red button we can click 289.149521  and then
all we do is draw another circle up here 293.902607 
and make it white  295.453418 and then we'll just
get that to about the size that we want
make it sort of like an oval like this 301.678909 
maybe it's pretty good  302.798729 and you just kind
of got to play with this and see there's
not really any right or wrong to it  307.197496 then
we'll click our gradient 308.560136  left-click and
bring that down this is doing a gradient
in black but we can change that  314.090769 we can
edit the gradient here  316.049489 we go to this
stop point and we just change it to
white  320.483031 oh now it's doing gradient to
black though we have changed this one as
well  324.516271 change this stop point as well to
white  328.601422 and now we have nice sort of that
one doesn't look as good to me it gets
kind of pinky 334.290710  but we can change that a
little bit and yeah doesn't it too bad
so that's gives it sort of a 3d look to
it 340.369533  you can put a border on the button as
well if we wanted to we can go add
stroke 344.914996  we can add like a nice darker
border to this  348.069008 and that gives it a
little bit more dimension as well 351.183844  so
yeah and then you put whatever you want 354.240427 
you want have text in there you could
draw like a little draw something in you
know your object whatever you want 359.681491  to be
inside here 361.195017  but that's basically a quick
way to do buttons I want to show you if
you come over here to pixabay you can
just search under a vector you can
download some of these vector graphics I
just searched buttons  374.490825 this will give you
a good idea for some to a lot of these
are gonna be pretty similar to what we
did you can see they just have a little
transparent some of them put gradients
on the actual button and then they also
do this white with a transparency 385.613233  but
just check out some of these or you can
just do like a Google search for buttons 388.993578 
just to get an idea  390.378770 for how you can do
different buttons you'll notice a lot of
these are very very simple  394.564163 this one they
just put a gradient of a white to give
it that glassy look on this icon 400.305650  so just
looking at
and figuring out it you know taking up
taking them apart in your mind  405.012033 you can
figure out how to recreate these pretty
simply  407.537573 hopefully that's been informative
