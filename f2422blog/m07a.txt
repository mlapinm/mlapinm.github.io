 1.588903  welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial  5.581130 in this video we'll be learning
how to draw lines the right way in
vector art 11.573826  and we'll be learning about
paths and objects 14.349637  and the difference
between the two 15.735700  so it's a very important
thing to learn  17.590046 and it's really what sets
Inkscape and illustrator and other
vector editors apart from Photoshop
and bitmap editors  27.872814 so what I mean is if
we grab this freehand tool which I've
cautioned you about using in the past 33.931493  we
can just draw whatever we want  35.809480 and it
creates kind of it draws that line  39.734199 but
then if we go back to our selection tool 41.535915 
we notice that this kind of squiggly
line that we've drawn behaves similar to
different shapes that we drew 49.263924  we can
click it a second time and rotate it
around  52.065317 we can apply some skew to it  55.371631 if
we just click it again we can just scale
and rotate we can scale it on a single
axis  60.991393 so it's kind of similar to when we
drew like our rectangles 66.191623  right we can do
all the same things to our rectangle 68.833063  so
this is sort of drawing a freehand line
but I caution you against it  73.127639 and the
difference between these two things are
one is a path  77.827766 well there's a lot of
differences but this is a path  80.535725 and this
is an object an object has some is
anything that is I mean I guess this
isn't the real way to define it but in
my mind  90.367894 an object is something that has
predetermined settings in vector art 95.999696  so
a square is a predetermined shape and so
it's like a circle  100.219886 as if we draw a
circle here  102.244147 so this circle has
predetermined math to make it much
simpler  106.559561 then than just drawing a bunch
of than just drawing a line  110.699706 so what I
mean by that is if we double-click very
quickly remember we got these different
points  115.662168 we have a point here that we can
determine the radius so the distance
from the center of the circle 121.823831  on the y
axis and the distance from the center of
the circle on the x axis  126.517017 so just off of
those two points using some simple math 129.959884 
you can create a circle 132.115933 
and so with very few instructions you
can tell the computer how to recreate
this circle  136.419893 and then also even leaving
out even with this part here 141.469457  I it's it's
a pretty simple operation to tell the
computer hey just leave out this certain
part of the circle so  150.119577 create an art from
this distance to this distance 152.999326  and just
don't draw the circle in and is to draw
a line to the center of the circle   here 157.819535 
so I guess what I'm saying is it's much
less intensive than if we were to grab
the freehand tool 163.677894  and draw and draw draw
and recreate this shape first of all if
we try and do that it's just not going
to look so pretty  170.519504 we can still make it
green and we can try and come up here
and change our stroke to make it kind of
fat to match that one 177.751156  the difference is
this the thing that we've drawn is a
path  181.352012 anytime we freehand draw something
or when we draw with the Bezier tool 185.014790 
like we're going to be using later 186.794744  it
creates a path not an object  189.070652 so the way
that Inkscape is interpreting this 192.746832  shape
that we drew  194.858555 we can tell by
double-clicking on it very quickly and
we see all these grey dots appear 200.750998  these
are all the different nodes 202.310722  that it that
have been created  204.978449 to tell Inkscape how
to recreate this shape 207.662600  and if we click
on this one would double click very
quickly  211.086298 or if we just click while we
have our right now  213.224130 it's defaulted into
our edit   pass by node tool 215.596955  and so now we
can see this is only we have four
different reference points  219.827312 is what
Inkscape is being told here it's saying
draw a circle with this X and this Y and
then cut out a radius from this point to
this point 228.141595  so it's much much simpler 229.973232 
which means it uses less space  231.892064 when
we're saving our file  232.907891 it's also what
lets us allows us to rescale without
losing clarity and without having our
object become pixelated 240.356006  this one we can
rescale to 241.684303  and it won't become pixelated 243.267984 
but it is much more intensive because we
have all these points 246.051885  and it's also
harder to edit 248.454937  so if we want to edit
this  250.099787 if we wanted to change any point of
it 254.046807  we can zoom in here and see   we can
actually move any of these grey dots 258.180447 
called nodes 258.982783  we can move it around  260.396679 and
kind of change the shape of this a
little bit  263.304876 but there's some
many of them to be tedious to do one by
one  268.320795 and that's kind of why I've
cautioned against using the freehand
tool  273.884064 anytime you would want to use the
freehand tool 276.205485  what you really should be
using is the Bezier tool  278.491711 and we're going
to cover that more in the next video
we'll go over using the Bezier tool 283.093591 
but let's do a little bit quickly here
to show you the basics of it  286.126595 so I'm
gonna left click here on our selection 288.579558 
I'll take this will delete this object
will delete our square will delete our
circle  293.409481 and will even delete this 295.005280 
squiggly line that we drew first  296.309379 so I'm
gonna click on the Bezier tool 298.469444  and we're
just going to left-click a single point
here  301.049330 and a single point here 302.569278  and then
I'll just hit B well I'm gonna the
Escape key I forgot  307.313510 so I was doing
something earlier and maybe if you
played with it you might be on a
different setting 311.195629 
so I'm actually on this spyro setting
but I want to be on just the regular
setting  315.965236 so make sure you have regular
selected  318.297911  and then will you probably do
by default  320.420111 then just left click come to
a different point and left click again 323.639439 
and hit the enter key  325.200067 and we've created
a straight line 326.927430  this is the recommended
way to create a line in Inkscape or any
vector image Pro editing program  333.377667 I've
come to the selection tool now we have
this selected 336.419602  so we can rotate this line
around just like we would any other just
like we would an object 342.519383  although this is
not an object   342.334961 it's a path and that a
path 344.699827  just means it's made up of nodes
and connecting lines between those nodes 351.159136 
so this is a very simple path  352.475116 if I
double click on it we see we have a node
here 355.055016  and a node here and that's it
that's this entire path it's creating a
path for a line to follow  362.335120 we can do a
little bit more advanced one 363.870930 if I click
on the Bezier tool again 365.934993  we can click a
couple different points 367.491135  and then hit
enter 369.846978  and now we've created a little bit
more tiny bit more advanced paths 375.517270  so we
can come here and click Edit the nodes
of this  378.120768 and we can see all right so
we've got a node here a node here  382.790931 and
it's just drawing a straight line
between each of them  

385.192154 now we can do the
same thing with our square  388.183045 or our
rectangle tool if we draw a rectangle 391.010098 
maybe we want to change 392.751101  maybe we want to
this kind of has 4 points 395.567143  right 1 2 3 4 397.823044 
but if we double click on it very
quickly 399.311043 
the options we have is round the corners
or change the size 403.469126  we can't move one 405.087221  one
point of it we don't have these
different nodes 409.165866  that's because this is
an object  410.315417 so we can turn an object into
a path in Inkscape and it's a really
important thing to learn how to do  416.523137 and
the way we do it we just go up to object 420.355006 
or we go up to path I mean 421.651144  and go object
to path 423.311229  so while our square is selected
our rectangle  426.671244 go to path  428.003455 then click
object to path 430.413367  now the compromise is we
can no longer round the corners of this 435.399151 
like we would like we could before 437.107399  if we
double click we don't have that rounded
corner option  439.753937 and we can't resize like
we like we could before  442.871627 I mean we can
still resize like this  444.211265 like we can any
drawn thing in Inkscape 447.535090  but if I
double-click very quickly 449.119128  now we have
these different points   to control 452.415094  so
it's kind of a subtle difference 453.964250  but now
we can make it like a shape like this 456.380165  so
we have four points  457.856307 this is how you
would create this shape in Inkscape 460.558892  if
we wanted to do that  462.148050 we can do the same
thing  463.410005 it's gonna get crazy with our
circle 465.970096  but we can do the same thing with
our circle  467.548789 so this we can go draw it 469.168722 
it's an object right now by default  470.890164 but
if we go path  472.386424 object to path 473.962228  now if we
click on this edit 476.036985  we can see the
different nodes of this 478.337900  Oh actually it's
not too crazy  480.038365 what it's done is its
created curved lines 484.122272  so it only has a
few more points than it did before 486.898290  so
now we can change the center point of
this  488.770457 which we couldn't do before  490.450185 we can
change the arc on this by grabbing this
it's kind of like a handle  496.450326 so we can
grab this we'll learn more about this in
the next tutorial about using these
handles  500.378347 but every node has a different
handle associated with it or has it has
these two handles  505.026462 that you can change
the arc so it's not just a straight line 508.258304 
then we can create kind of a cool wacky
looking shape  512.305065 so because it's a because
it's now a path  515.493946 so I'd like you to play
with that it's really important to learn
how to do that how to change an object
to a path 521.413151  same thing if we draw our star 523.118154 
we can kind of control it very quickly
but everything happens it Mears 527.514374  if we
want to just create we want to just move
this one point  530.558377 and keep the rest of it
the same 532.186038 
like let's come down here a time you
might use that as like if you want the
point of the star to be taller than the
rest of it  539.386233 we can't do that right now 541.394333  we
can do it we can stretch the whole thing 544.382210 
or if we double-click we can make all
the points more pointy  548.996165 but if I want to
make just this top one really pointy and
the rest of them kind of stubby  552.666122 we have
to convert it to a path  554.948861 so we select it  
go to path  557.562027 and go object to path  559.366124 and now
if we double-click  561.134575 we have every
different point we can control
separately  563.902696 so now we control just this 565.330234 
and make this one really pointy 566.714491  and the
rest we can keep the same  568.842388 or we could
change the rest around to  570.814118 in fact we can
change the shape whoa I would didn't
mean to do that ctrl Z  575.281490 we can change the
shape to any do a completely different
shape altogether 580.252305  but we lose those
options  582.013969 so we can no we can't go back
and change the the corners now  585.198363 like we
did when it was an object  586.742047 we just can't
do that  587.898363 so that's kind of a quick
introduction to paths and objects in
Inkscape  594.510153 it'll come together more in the
next video where we talked about using
the Bezier tool  600.476749 because it's a it's kind
of creates a path  602.418224 and we learned about
how to create these arcs 604.766177  and learn about
the differences between that  607.018115 oh I guess
I will say too  608.282277 it's something important
if we want to take this letter 611.974069  so this
is also kind of an object at first if we
zoom in 615.718389  it's an object it's a text
object so I have some different
parameters  618.862420 but if we want to we can
actually if you want to edit the shape
of this letter  623.729708 like really get down to
it  625.002693 if we double click right now  626.206135 the
option is 628.286498  keep typing right but if we
want to change it we can also convert
this  632.378242 go to object to path 634.006466  and then if we
double click 635.590217  we can edit the shape of
this letter individually  640.324113 so sometimes
you'll want to do this especially if
you're creating like a logo out of a
certain letter  645.398103 you can actually kind of
come in and create your own kind of
thing  648.905960 yeah so that's another option with
doing objects - path 654.070009  so we'll be doing
we'll be doing some more cool stuff with
this in future videos -  658.442139 hope that's made
sense go ahead and ask questions comment
below  661.806311 like and subscribe and I'll see
you in the next video 664.474435
