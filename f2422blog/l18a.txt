 1.521981 hey guys welcome back to another
Inkscape tutorial 6.514762  in this video I want
to show you one of my most favorite
tools in Inkscape 11.679113  and that's the trace
bitmap tool 13.521857  so you go to path and then
you go to trace bitmap  17.677641 when you have an
image selected  19.329667 so we're gonna be playing
with that today 21.093694  it's a really really
cool tool  22.289555 in the last video we traced
using the Bezier tool  25.833006 we traced an image
of a guy falling 27.723429  we're gonna do that
again 29.023572  only we're not going to use the
Bezier tool  31.255525 so I'm going to drag this
image in  32.841965 this is an image you can find
out where we got it in the last video 35.217925  we
were trying to pixabay.com and search
person 37.641945  we downloaded this free image  39.070063 so
you can follow along if you want to do
that 41.386109  but now we're gonna do this again
only instead of tracing it 45.045784 
oops ctrl Z I'll make sure I lock this
like I like to do  49.269099 so instead of tracing
it like we did last time 51.548822  we like zoomed
in and we traced every single point of
here  54.205024 and created this whole little
outline 55.861200  we're not gonna do that this
time  57.525051 we're going to just use this tool
that's built into Inkscape  60.960974 so we go to
we select the image 62.717139  and then we go to
path  64.749115 and then we go to trace bitmap 66.901528  and
it comes up with these different options 68.696954 
so brightness cutoff and a certain
threshold 73.025248  we'll just leave it in here
right now 74.636201  and we'll click update  76.012201 so if
we hit update it shows us a little
preview 78.768429  of what it'll look like if we
were to go ahead  81.012130 and try and trace all
the lines of this image based on the
brightness of the pixels  87.279928 so that looks
okay let's just see what that looks like 91.762996 
so if we hit OK  92.774813 it'll take a minute and
they'll actually do that 95.014619  so it traced it
created a path here  99.071056 and we can drag and
see what it looks like  101.526849 so this is what
it's created based off of this image  103.607458 and
this is all a vector path 106.938981  so if we zoom
in 107.854759  we can see that's actually pretty
cool detail  111.454722 so we see this guy here  113.046822 and
yeah I like it 116.877091  and so we can actually go
in now 118.189237 if we edit the different nodes 119.981081  we
can come in and edit different parts of
this   and change it too  123.405861 so essentially it
did what we just tried to do with the
Bezier tool 128.096021 
didn't do as good a job though if you
notice because look here in the face 131.181575  you
so where my head  133.993667 I'll just close this 136.857642  so
here in the face it's a little bit  138.833562 it
didn't get the whole face  140.401811 but did get
some of the eyebrow 141.329741  it got some more
detail than we actually got 143.797500  got some
detail in the hair  144.749693 so it's not a
complete silhouette 146.321591  but instead of just
traced everything based on the the
brightness of the pixel  152.415501 it's super cool
huh 153.629638  but the thing is it's all tied
together here  155.289345 I'm not sure if there's
different layers 156.682352  we can tell 157.798451  we can
check by going ctrl shift G 160.262318  and see if
we can ungroup anything here 162.470724  and it
looks like it's all just one level  165.099447 so
we'd need to cut this out which we can
do 168.146878  but first I'm just going to delete
this  169.215012 let's come back up and let's try
again  171.082991 so we click on our image  174.823035 and then
we go to path trace bitmap 177.731088  so instead of
doing the brightness cut off  180.562862 well we can
just change the threshold  182.102702 so we can
lower this to maybe and change the 4 to
a 1  184.974889 and go update  186.242766 and then it gets just
the person  187.999744 but it doesn't get all the
person  189.855016 so then we don't have that if we
hit OK we see we get this kind of thing
going  195.538951 so we get more detail in the shirt 197.539009 
but it's a lot lighter  199.618931 so it's still
this isn't perfect for what we want to
do  202.662726 although it is kind of cool 203.807370  if we did
want to keep this  204.699501 let's just keep it for
fun  205.783528 let's turn it red 206.947455  and let's bring it
over here 207.951322  because then what we can do is
go to our edge detection  


211.502975 and do the same
thing so we hit update  213.491621 and now it's
going to show us a preview of the edge
detection  216.512335 oh nothing is selected right
now 218.032649  we have to make sure we have our
picture selected that we want to trace
our bitmap  223.574704 and it has to be a bitmap if
we select a vector it won't do anything
has to be a bitmap that we're tracing 227.991938 
which this is it's a JPEG image  I think 231.784618 
so we hit update and now it'll show ok 234.616780 
so let's change this threshold that's
lower lower this down to maybe 3 5 hit
update  239.378827 that's still not quite where we
want  241.482802 let's go way down to 0.06  243.642784 that's
pretty cool 245.030740  I'm gonna go down even lower 247.010578 
oh not to 0  248.126608 update so 0.10 wait okay  251.394779 so
now we've got another thing traced  254.078757 oh I
got a little piece of something up here
it looks like  257.235272 but that's pretty neat huh 258.890800 
and so now we have this outline 260.763284  here
which did a pretty good job of doing the
edge detection 264.661310  it wasn't doing
it wasn't tracing based off 266.529352  of the
brightness of the pixels  268.097279 it was tracing
based off of the edge that it could find
like a hard edge which I guess probably
uses some sort of brightness to detect
it anyway 275.045656  but now we can move this over 277.089211 
let's send this to the top layer 278.737306  and now
we have like we can kind of merge 280.989221  and
create a really cool looking thing 282.881176  maybe
turn this blue  284.373430 or like yeah like a green
so we can create a really cool look by
merging these two together 292.357198  that's pretty
neat huh   see if I can select both of
them at the same time click and shift
click  300.782424 click shift click there we go  303.450462 so
now we have this cool kind of effect
going on here  307.294664 and we can keep doing this 309.362685 
we can get different layers that we want
to out of this 311.526612  so we can click our
bitmap again 313.966789  and then this is still
opened up so whatever's clicked here
we'll just get updated  317.406486 so we can go to
color quantization  320.970639 it's a word you don't
use very often cover quantization 323.582665  so we
click update  324.710544 and what that's going to do 325.753548 
it's going to create something like this 327.052744 
but it's gonna do it with eight
different colors 329.067528  so I'm gonna do it just
to illustrate all the four colors  332.452076 and
hit update  333.431793 so using just four colors 

335.432400 
it's going to it's going to basically
break this image into four different
colors thresholds  341.012760 so I'll click click
okay and then we can come down here 345.242377  and
so that's created a pretty cool thing 347.222714 
and we've got different colors here  so
if we hit ctrl shift G and ungroup  352.676733 we
can see there's different there should
be different noted before right  356.844534 ctrl
shift G okay maybe it's just did for
whatever reason it did two colors 363.244730  it's
just black and white  364.268656 that's kind of cool
too though  366.276873 so just kind of play around
with this  368.460559 and you can see so let's let's
take it up again to six do update  371.448439 update
do okay  375.048849 I'm trying to get different
colors here I think  376.904788 we can get it 377.988561  now
it's doing all black  379.284492 do I have a setting
that's only doing black somewhere  381.768395 I
should make sure I'm not  383.316819 because this
can do this can do colors also 385.924876  but for
some reason it's just doing black right
now  388.256398 Oh colors oh I see
so on this is a single I was on single
scan which is why it's just doing black 395.952732 
if I want to do multiple colors I click
here on colors  398.616517 and
then I go down to four 400.846251  wall selected and
hit update with you it looks like
that'll look cool 404.574862 
now I hit okay  

405.544343 and now what it's doing
is that just using four colors  409.262269 it's
creating a version of this 411.160274  which is how
you know you see this 415.528210  could be like a
t-shirt print of this because it really
only has four colors  418.133130 is it awesome and
we can break out these colors now we can
go ctrl shift G  423.003470 and now we can see we
have our background color  425.837279 alright we can
delete that if we want  427.886236 we can delete
these ones here  430.013832 if we want to 431.139139  and we can
see just these different parts 433.683106  so
they're all kind of hooked to each other 435.208163 
and there's I'll show you in the next
video 436.475079  how to get rid of this down here 438.133106 
because there's not really we could use
like the erase tool 440.538685  I suppose and trying
to erase it out but we don't we're not
going to do that 444.610771  there's no a better way
to do it  446.094988 yeah awesome tool isn't it
pretty good pretty cool 450.285329  so let's come up
here  451.814807 and let's go to we can do
brightness steps  453.712653 and just kind of see
what that looks like 456.250045 
so brightener steps is gonna be similar
to this to the brightness cutoff 460.812925  we've
got we can do just graze and do like
five different grays 464.827165  and update and see
what it looks like in five different
shades of grey 467.716757  or we can do three
different shades of gray  here 

470.500181  three is a
bit too little  472.231904 let's do six  473.555191 hit okay  474.789862 and
now this is going to be the last one we
actually have some reds 477.772582  but this time
it's just all just Gray's 480.210110  so it'll look
similarly to the other one  482.186277 maybe that's
too many you could see the sky is two
different shades  485.207434 but yeah play with this 487.988568 
it's awesome and you can use it on
vector art too  491.194486 if you bring in like a
dirty 492.616073  like a small little like a fav
icon like  495.924168 for my website  497.201017 and it has
little pixelation  498.694395 it's kind of messy you
can run this on it 502.298159  and kind of clean it
up then you can scale it much larger  504.930450 if
ever you have a tiny little tiny little
thumbnail of a like a vector graphic 510.690631 
let's see here  511.611220 so we just do one real
quick 513.991538  if we find a little logo that's
like too small 516.769248 
these are all gonna be pretty good
quality 519.458386  but sometimes you'll find a
really small grainy logo  522.259497 that's just
that you want to scale up massively and
put it on a billboard 526.039633 
well what you'll do is just run that
trace  528.989406 and you don't have the source file
for it if all you have is a teeny to
little  532.613783 logo then you can bring it in
here 536.322967 
trace a bitmap on it  538.159066 and then scale it
up much larger 539.475710  and you can clean up you
know those little portions as well 542.431062  so
that's the trace bitmap tool one of my
very favorite tools of all time in
Inkscape  548.962967 and it is super powerful
especially if you want to do like
t-shirt 551.453193  prints we're creating a kind of
a print quickly  553.389610 based off of a real
photograph  554.749815 so I hope you liked this
video  556.767910 comment subscribe like below and
let me know how you use this tool
because I'm curious of other
applications  562.867093 you can use it for 563.937502 
I'm sure the sky is the limit 565.583624  appreciate
your watching  567.122422 we'll catch you on the
next video 568.288976  568.288976  568.288976
