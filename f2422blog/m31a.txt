 2.232597 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial 5.239500  in this video I want to show
you a great time-saving
resource when working in vector or doing
anything with creative artwork really 12.285255 
and that is to use existing images or
vector graphics as your inspiration and
as your basis 18.609125  you can learn a lot by
kind of dissecting and looking at
different artwork especially vector
artwork 24.989674  and so pixabay.com if you've
watched my channel at all you know I
really like to get artwork from pixabay
because they have such open licensing so
every image or a video or piece of media
that we want to look at 37.592547  we can see free
for commercial use no attribution
required  41.037505 we can look at the user
submitted it this user has submitted
nine images  and they've just shared it
with the community  47.225802 we can also share our
own images  50.577598 and so you can do the same
thing there's like Wikimedia and there's
lots of like Creative Commons sites this
is just one that I like to use 58.176511  but it's
nice to have artwork that you can use
that you don't to be worried about
what's it called like copyright
infringement and things like that 68.665785  anyway
what I like to do is I go to vector
graphics  71.782371 and I'll search for something
you can search for something specific or
you can just browse and look through
check it out here's like a cool vector
of Bitcoin  79.980292 that someone's created and
shared so we could download this and
bring it in as a transparent background
in fact let's just do it 86.157867 
so we'll download the vector version of
this Bitcoin  89.533380 if we wanted to do I don't
know if they even have like a resume  93.475026 I'm
just trying to think like any kind of
thing so this is like a cool word cloud
resume that we could download  99.641390 so we go
download this is a Adobe Illustrator
file but that's fine because Inkscape
can open those 105.137506  maybe we want to do some
sort of a cartoon character 108.210535  so we find
something nice and cartoony like this
guy here  112.261909 and we can just download this 113.846823 
oh just kidding this is a PNG only
because I searched under images we need
to make sure we go vector 118.938550  we get we can
still download and use that but I'm
gonna show you when we bring it into
Inkscape 123.955394  we're not going to be able to
edit each individual layer  127.358821 so what's a
good thing that trees pretty cool 130.086514 
let's find like this monkey here this
owl check this cat
oh this elephant this giraffe I mean
elephant 138.871372  let's download this giraffe and
then let's hop over to Inkscape and I'll
show you kinda what I mean with some of
this  144.170525 so over here on Inkscape now that I
have those downloaded I just go to open 148.979513 
and I can choose this giraffe or we've
got the Bitcoin or some different things
I guess we'll do the let's do the
Bitcoin first since we did that one
first 156.454840  so this is just a nice vector
image which means it's probably has some
different group components so we can go
ctrl shift G on the keyboard 165.471664  to ungroup
and then we could change  168.827692 we could change
this B so it's got some some different
kind of pattern on it I'm not quite sure
if this was drawn in Inkscape we could
actually  177.626159 yeah we can edit this pattern
and look  179.231875 we can come over here and we
can change the way this gradient is oh
it's actually not a pattern  183.962678 so it's that
gradient  185.235084 that's how they've created this
which is which is really cool 187.622245   so we can
come over here and change the gradient
we can change what the way this
background color is if we want it to be
a bluish  195.457032 we could change it accordingly 198.129045 
so my point is we can get in here and
change all kinds of this stuff 201.965389  and we
can really pull this apart and use it 203.726054  as
a basis to design maybe like light coin
or you know some other cryptocurrency 209.716683  we
can also let's open up like this giraffe
one 213.466152  so that I'm gonna close this real
quick  217.741675 so we have this draft here too
which is the same thing it's all grouped
by default usually what you bring in 222.161863  and
then to edit it you can ungroup another
way to ungroup is to go to object
ungroup while they are wallet selected 229.914786 
and that'll take our background separate
so maybe we want this background to be a
little different along to be against red
or black or gray  237.984734 and then we can change
the shadow down here to be something a
little bit different as well 241.581341  if we
wanted to  243.189017 so really we can just come in
here and change anything that we want
about this giraffe  248.756765 we can change the
color and  249.862108 then we can even get in and
change the actual shape  252.282398 if we want this
ear to be a little bit more fat if we
want to change this the mouth like hello 257.901288 
something we can do like all kinds of
cartoony type stuff 261.037821 
yeah it's just really really great  265.818120 what
else let's go to do we download
something else yeah the word cloud so
this word cloud was in Adobe an Adobe
Illustrator file  273.441062 but Inkscape can open
Adobe illustrators and no problem 277.357101  you
might have a problem editing the words
let's see here  283.009466 so ctrl shift G oh I
always do that I did that 286.741655  if you hit
Windows key shift G it does something
else  290.451128 but ctrl shift G will ungroup it so
then we can get in here or object
ungroup there we go  298.031169 so now we can we can
move around each one of these letters
individually  302.599218 we can change colors of all
this if want to change the search to
like a blue 307.093874  and I believe if these are
paths we can get in and actually yeah so
the they've converted these two paths 314.002962  or
at least maybe the the engine did that
imported it sometimes it'll be text
sometimes it'll be paths 318.592061  so this is
actually path which isn't a super ideal 321.760055 
but still I think you're probably seeing
you know you kind of get the point if
you want to do just anything that you
want to search for it's just such a huge
time-saver  332.652050 so we search under vector
graphics for mountains and there's this
one I actually use this in a demo video
of Inkscape so I already have it
downloaded  340.692944 but we can go to open and we
can actually find that I have a whole
bunch of different ones here 345.724806  that I've
downloaded that 347.467465  I know I can you don't
use and let's go to close this  353.293255 so this
is just a really cool background you
could use for lots of different things 358.045104 
but you could use it for a cartoon 359.712601  if
you want to just a tree we can go to
object and go to ungroup  363.603769 and we can grab
just a tree if we'd like just the way
this tree looks 368.185415  we can just use this
tree 370.405051  and maybe we want it to be like
kind of winter we could draw overtop of
it  373.827939 or we can actually ungroup this as
well and it has a whole bunch of
different parts 378.825237  doesn't it ctrl shift G
yeah so we can make this kind of like
white like it has snow on it 386.969022  so we can
grab all these different these different
highlight parts 390.684149  we could even select by
color and then we can make certain parts
of that white 394.996376 
we can just get in and start modifying
this  398.143913 we can change this branch here if
we wanted to  400.848102 and make it longer 403.005110  or
change some of the colors that but
there's lots of different nodes here 406.100314  but
my point is you can see you and we can
learn and see how they drew this 411.924501  we get
an examine and then we can learn how to
draw our own or use this  it's kind of a
template for creating a much smaller
tree or a different type of tree 420.593499  so
there's all kinds of great things you
can do and if we didn't want the tree
you know we could remove this background
or we can change the color of the
background  429.023600 we can grab just the
mountains 431.851563  if we want just the mountains
here we can delete a lot of this other
stuff  435.833130 and just have the mountains and
just use them as our as our template
ctrl Z ctrl shift G to ungroup  446.399664 and now
we have just some nice mountains here
without everything else we can change
the colors here and get in and change
the shape of the mountain a little bit
if we wanted to  454.473298 so just a lot a lot of
great things you can do  457.625560 anyway I think
you're seeing the point vector using
existing vector art is incredibly
powerful  464.156942 just make sure to check your
licensing 466.448648  but you can usually find just
awesome awesome things especially  470.381163 if
you're doing animation and want
something for a basis for that 473.097240  so that's
been informative I hope you'll play with
that using existing vectors as a basis
for your designs at least especially
while you're learning Inkscape and while
you're learning how to do different
designs  486.195638 it can be a huge time saver and
a great educational resource  489.952850 thanks for
watching go ahead and leave your
questions comments below  492.524630 let me know if
you have other resources besides pixabay
that have very good open clear licensing 498.016054 
for you and yeah look forward to your
question in the comments 502.283594  and I hope to
see you in the next video 504.921098  504.921098  504.921098
