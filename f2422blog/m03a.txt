 1.329818 
welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial  5.837959 in this video we'll be looking
at the fill and stroke options  8.842222 which let
us change the color and lots of
different options  12.275578 for the fill and
stroke of an object  14.373537 so to get started
we'll draw an object  16.672562 so I'll just click
on the rectangle tool  19.090838 we'll draw a
rectangle  20.319885 hit the plus key to kind of
zoom in a little bit 22.422924  I'll scroll wheel
up here  24.794148 so we have a nice big square  27.181336 oh
one thing I wanted to show you very
quickly too  30.239544 in the last video we were
kind of playing with when we drew a
circle  33.650518 I'm going to draw a circle here 35.383035  I
didn't do it this time 36.383352  but sometimes
it'll remember the last thing you did  39.783692 so
for example if I make this circle like a
like a pacman shape 43.119701  in fact let's just
make pac-man 44.597434  and if I come over here 47.339021  and
now I delete this square 49.324826  and I delete
this circle  50.524304 and I want to draw another
circle  52.042853 if I go to draw it's gonna draw
pac-man again  55.005936 because it remembers the
last shape you draw  57.465347 if I do or the last
settings for that shape 60.254326  if I do a square 61.564394 
or a rectangle  with the rectangle tool 64.351604 
we make it blue 65.385776  and we give it rounded
corners 66.936910  and then we go to draw another
rectangle 70.637930  it's gonna do blue with a
rounded corner  73.473780 so the tool remembers
what you're doing 75.596003  which is pretty cool 77.104869 
which it's actually pretty useful 78.407477 
sometimes however it can be a problem 81.525096 
I'll show you when that can be a problem 83.218134 
maybe you let's delete this  86.465912 and delete a
couple of these  87.746660 and maybe we want to
make this white  90.844098 so we click on white
tear   92.087498  so now we know it's there because
it's selected  94.622918 it has a white fill  96.617294 which
everything else has a transparent this
our page is really transparent  99.955412 but it
appears white to 101.489448  us just because a lot
of times people design with a white
background  104.700106 because it might be a white
web page or they're printing on white
paper  108.268949 so we can left-click and drag this
over top  110.786410 and we can see uh-huh yeah
that's white for sure  113.903665 but the problem is
if I hit delete right now  116.443960 and I go to
draw a star  118.007633 and I left-click and drag 120.202577 
well nothing's happening like it's not
drawing anything 123.105615  we can kind of see the
stars kind of erasing like making our
page borders look weird here 127.866205  and it is
there is a star here 130.181419  it's selected 130.485183  we
just can't see it because it's white 133.053709  so
I can
do it off it and I can bring it over
here  to see 136.590829  which is sometimes why I
will actually draw  139.285727 so right now our
stars still here right we just can't see
it  142.187972 sometimes I like to put a background
over top  145.068108 so if all that's I'll just draw
like a rectangle  147.502689 and make it gray 149.147723  and
give it like not rounded corners  151.540240 but
I'll just I'll just make it give my
whole page a background  like this 157.811713  and
then this is over top of my star so if I
layer it down I click here 162.869082  and lower it
down to the very bottom  164.973639   we see my star
now  167.175045 so if you're ever designing
something in white sometimes it's good
to put it over top of a like a different
color you can do it  173.667222 whatever you want to
do you can do a light grey or blue or
like a light when any color you want to
do really 179.155816  but that's just what's
something I sometimes do 182.084591  just because
remember the Inkscape will keep will
remember the color of the last thing you
drew so when you go to draw it 188.872324  so now
it's gray  189.957766 but if it were white  191.111711 then if I
go to draw another circle 193.479580  it's gonna
appear white  195.047539 and I won't see it 196.129625  and it
can be kind of confusing sometimes like
YMS  198.529782 you see the options for it 199.981164  you can
resize it  201.426901 but you can't actually see it 202.985540 
because it's white so you have to drag
it on top of another color to see it 206.089054  or
you can just come down here  and change
the color of it which is what  209.511592 I'll do
often too 210.508917 
and then again see it's still making
pac-man  213.660844 so if we want to make it a
complete circle we double click  complete
the circle  217.247806 but it'll remember the last
settings for the object that you drew 220.392794 
color and settings for that  object  

224.505537 okay
let's get into fill and Stroke  226.440820 so I'm
gonna drag this over here  228.149255 we have this
circle  229.044199 I'm to get into the fill and
Stroke options  231.270865 so we can change the
stroke of this 233.127668  first of all I'm gonna
delete this grey will delete this white
star 236.993858  and right now we see we don't have
a stroke at all 239.509050  we know that because if
we turn this white everything is
completely wiped  242.362338 there's no outline 243.323947  we
can give it a stroke by holding down the
shift key 246.287485  and clicking on any color 247.221340 
we'll do like a light green  249.106056 so now we
have a green stroke with a white fill 253.366805  so
if we were to print this  254.642111 it would it
would print a white color if we could  257.718527 if
we're actually a better thing would be
if we were to like upload it 260.254854  it have a
transparent background 263.495715  and then on our
website we just have a white circle with
a green
around it 267.403244  so maybe we want to change the
so we want to change the thickness of
this of this  stroke this green stroke  275.702517 so
to get into fill and stroke options 277.571134  we
can go to click on object 279.414377  and go down to
fill and stroke  281.703855 and click  282.643356 and it brings
up these fill and stroke options 284.472631  there's
also a shortcut key  286.484694 it said we can do
shift ctrl F to bring up this panel  290.185352 or
we could right click  292.319796 and go to fill and
Stroke  293.922268 once we're in fill and Stroke we
have some different options for
controlling  298.567279 let's do this stroke first
so right if aught 301.208367  we're on fill but if
we go to stroke paint 303.970294  or on stroke so we
see our fill is white I'm on the color
wheel you might be if you if you're your
first time coming in you might be on RGB 311.624376 
so we have these different color options
RGB HSL CMYK will  316.512924 so read RGB stands for
red green blue 320.028752  it just it's a mixture of
these colors  321.815487 so right now we're on white 323.376938 
we have zero red 0 green zero blue 326.309137  and
then 100% alpha or 255 so 255 is the
default color 331.879704  and if you're not familiar
with colors 333.407504  what it does it just mixes
between 0 and 255 335.864874 
it mixes these colors so 338.879432  it assigns a
color to blue 341.292357  so if I want to have my
have my blue be it zero  344.861949 and everything
else be 255 it creates this shade of
blue  349.663763 if I want to have it add some green
in there  354.224828 I can create this shade of blue 355.729500 
which is mixing so we have 0 0 255 360.171586  is
how to create this color 

361.353150  and then my
alpha is at 255 also 363.629930  that kind of makes
sense so that's one way you can do it
with red green blue 368.668592  CMYK is for if your
is a different way it's cyan magenta
yellow and K  a black I think  378.097413 so this is
for like printers 379.799022  so if you're printing
it like a professional printer 381.834328  sometimes
they'll tell you a CMYK color  385.020564 that you
should send your stuff in  387.260133 and that helps
it print in a real world color  389.709362 because
it doesn't it works differently than red
green and blue pixels on your screen 393.887979 
CMYK uses these different colors of ink 396.979679 
and mixes them together to create every
different color 399.596460 
so what you're seeing on your screen is
not necessarily gonna be the same color
it prints out 404.794147  sometimes it'll be very
very different  406.695757 and so if you're
designing something for print 409.019203  you might
want to work in the CMYK color space  411.243057 and
if your design something for the web 413.581946  you
might want to do RGB 414.769475  what I do a lot is
this color wheel 417.097570  I'm also which is good
for like web or displays 420.158477  so the wheel
lets you choose around this wheel 423.199860  you
can choose the color  424.560608 and then you can
kind of scroll in between 427.130744  I can or I
click and drag to kind of get a
different the color  I want  433.341152 so if it's if
I want to do a if you go out one corner
of the triangle 436.546390  it goes to solid to the
color  438.794848 the other corner is completely
white 440.571560  and the other corner is completely
black  442.032740 and so you can go between if I
want to go between the green color  445.039542 and
the black color I get like a darker
green 447.411175  if I want to go between the green
color and the white color I get a
lighter green  451.597524 so I can go anywhere in
between there 453.280245  so I like to use the color
wheel when I'm picking colors 456.218703  anyway
let's set this let's set it to a red 459.390087 
like a nice red for our fill color 461.671039  let's
go to the stroke tab 463.266390  there's three
different tabs fill stroke paint and
stroke style 467.483216  but if we go to the stroke
paint tab 470.128794  we can do the same thing with
the cover where we can change 472.764032  the kind
of color and the way the stroke appears 475.817048 
if we go to the stroke style 478.057796  we can
change the width of it so right now it's
12 almost 12 and a half millimeters 482.267683  but
we can scale that down a little bit by
clicking and we click and hold 486.546118  we can
make a nice thin  stroke 489.222807  we can make it
really thick you can actually make it so
thick that it erases your color
altogether  494.230607 like if I do 200 on this  496.915527 it's
just gonna well it actually messes
things up but it's actually  501.144189 this might
not export properly  502.740879 let's do 100  503.679677 so you
can make things like really crazy 506.524620  with
your stroke so don't ever take it make
it too big or if ever you're getting
problems 510.610810  and your stroke might be too
big  511.889631 let's change this down to like 10
maybe 514.544347  we can change the debt instead of
having a straight line 517.516456  we can change it
to like a dotted line  518.749064 or a dashed line
 521.302329 we can do dashes  522.651649 so you can control
different ways maybe if you're like an
elementary school teacher 525.654732  and you want
to do a cutout of a star  528.071762 we can just
draw this 529.300764  this is a good example of I
was talking about earlier 532.149675  so this object
that we're drawing 533.730378 
now has the same characteristics a red
fill a black stroke with a duck with a
dashed stroke style  541.896274 so it's gonna be the
same thing as our lat with what we last
and it ended up doing  

546.456115 but let's bring
this back to 548.866227  so now we're doing our star 549.936114 
if we zoom in close here and look at the
point of the star 552.428676  we can change the
joints the overlaps of the lines too
rounded  556.992055 gives us a rounded star corner 558.743551 
change it to like a flat like a cut off
edge  561.718812 or by default it's just this pointy 564.195955 
we can change the cap but that's going
to be for if we have end points like a
line we'll do that change the capital
debt later  570.871442 but you had different dashes
we changed the width of it so if we make
this smaller  575.776724 it's like a just a thinner 
line 578.335726  if we want no stroke at all 579.611735  we can
hit the minus key and zoom out here  581.625839 and
look if we just go to stroke  583.535521 and hit
this X key 584.752505 
there's no stroke  585.282708 so it's just a fill 586.888513  we
can also go to fill  589.425838 and do this X key
and have no fill and have just a stroke 593.009375 
so this is literally no fill it's not a
white fill 595.692322  it's none which means if we
drag the start over top of our other
objects 600.598830 
we'll just see that they're gonna appear
right in the middle of it 604.277220  even though
it's behind  it 605.499488 what else okay we can do
so if we if we do a fill  611.732639 we can also do
a gradient  613.319283 we can apply a gradient to
the stroke or the fill  616.210326 so if I click
this linear gradient  617.835405 it'll gradient from
the red color   over to white 620.690507  we can also
change the color of that  622.979305 oh well we have
two in our color wheel 625.295496  so change this 626.489010 
and we can go to our  628.553613 how do we do that 629.637695 
all we have to edit the gradient here 632.155904  so
we actually have to click on here  634.585767 and
then there's an edit somewhere right
here 637.179123  edit gradient  638.438489 and so this lets us
change it  640.771006 we can change the actual way
the gradient is  642.655654 the actual orientation
of it 645.386992  so it's good like from top to
bottom  646.589781 and then we can come over here 648.565518 
and change the colors  649.697808 of it if we want
to 651.099509  we're not going to edit the colors
just yet 654.441731 
we can do a radial gradient 657.588012  which means
we start from the middle 658.994702  and go out to
the sides 660.672774  and we can change kind of the
way that works 662.275972  we can change the
position of it  663.613727 another way to get these
options to appear actually  667.000303 it's
click on the gradient tool  668.485201 so if I have
everything D selected right now 670.383772  we can
click on the gradient tool on the
toolbar  673.039668 and then click and we can edit
this gradient  674.923795 and we can also apply a
new gradient we can draw  a new gradient
in  679.467151 for example if we want to click on
the hit escape to x  682.761073 so that's gradient
tool we can apply a gradient to  685.247422 what's
selected right now  687.638193 so if I go to the
gradient tool  690.427309 we can apply a gradient 691.372683  I
thought we could do that  692.566697 what's going on
here 693.417944  anyway there's a way we can do it
we can't apply a gradient 698.609372  but it's
acting funny for me right now 700.361141  don't know 703.268556 
why whatever object selected the fill
the options for the fill and stroke will
show for that object  708.062093 so we've got right
here  709.440959 we're showing the fill for this
object and if we click over here on the
star  713.645267 we're looking at what we were last
seeing with it which is showing the
different gradients  for it 717.808601  if I want to
have it be a solid gray 720.423317  we can do that 721.210188 
if I want to a pattern  722.944428 we can click over
here 723.817127  and we can actually apply a pattern 725.358963 
so we've got these bars or stripes I
guess is what it's called we can do
little circles  730.536446 so you can do some pretty
cool patterns in there too  733.065086 yeah wavy
line but that's just a single line is it
there's some cool ones wavy yeah 741.091163  there's
some cool ones here and again 742.395313  so it's
like transparency on the back of it  744.777490 and
then it's just shining through 746.673249  yeah oh
did I go over blur so we can also blur  
this 751.838170  and I didn't talk much about alpha
either 753.800891  so we want to blur the store 755.096424  we
have this blur settings  756.272592 and these
settings apply to everything both the
gradient and the stroke 759.353748  so we have a
nice blurry looking star  here now 762.325902  you
know the blur is at 5.4 percent 765.102817  you can
blur it crazy out  767.537443 or you can come all
the way down 768.884155  usually I'll only apply a
tiny blur  770.708826 if I do some blur 771.674949  and we can
change opacity too  773.645720 so opacities might
write the transparency and that applies
to the object the total object 779.916332  the
stroke and the fill 780.847216  so now we see it's
fading through we can see the object
below 784.768146  it very well if we do the opacity
all the way up then it hides the object 788.108486 
it's over top the object behind it 790.055356  we
can also change just the opacity of the
color 793.694291  by by changing the Alpha Channel 796.470821 
so right now the Alpha on this red is
all the way up  798.844495 if we change the Alpha
down 799.992205 
go all the way to zero  801.649642 and have a nun 803.123451 
well we can go to like middle and have
it be sort of fading through  806.125174 but our
stroke is still strong  808.507623 we can go to our
stroke tab and change the alpha of our
stroke  812.689211 so that our stroke is sort of
transparent  814.898032 but our fill color is still
strong  816.830889 oh it's not completely strong
because our opacity is not all the way
up yet
there we go  820.721410 so just be aware of that
sometimes you'll have your opacity  down
to like here  

826.352431 and you'll go to draw
another object  827.648304 and then it'll be kind of
see-through and you'll be maybe you'll
wonder why  831.221297 but it's because you need to
go into your fill and Stroke and bring
your opacity all the way back up 835.306240  if you
do the color pick sometimes  838.335989 this color
pick tool that you pick a color on the
screen 841.173291  and if you pick a color 842.287214  that has
opacity in it  844.363087 then you'll be on see on
our stroke we changed our stroke but 847.732678 
it's it has opacity so this color pick
tool will pick the same opacity and
color 853.020615  of whatever you select on it so
just be aware of that  855.877554 it'll work   in that
fashion  858.813903 what else so we can change 860.675808  I'm
not going to get to that just yet 864.977440  I
think that's all I'm going to talk about 866.656669 
as far as the fill and Stroke goes 868.618075  so
just know play with all these you really
have to just play with it 871.901159  because you're
gonna things just behave differently
than you might think 875.178778 
but once you get used to this 876.781386  changing
your stroke and your fill and your
opacity and your alpha Channel 881.531635  once you
get used to doing all that  883.705626 you can do a
lot of cool stuff but  885.796623 it might be a
little frustrating at first so just make
sure you know right click go to your
