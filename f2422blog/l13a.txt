 2.605491  welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial 5.783238  in this video i want to go over
the document settings and creating a new
document and setting it up for your
purposes 13.248386  whether that's to create user
interface like a app design a webpage
whether you want to print a poster 20.526761  or a
birthday invitation or design a t-shirt
or whatever you want to do i'm going to
show you how to set up the document
accordingly  27.990557 and then we're also going to
be exporting  30.922401 so we'll i'll show you how
to export out in different ways that we
can export in different formats  35.650923 that
will be great to achieve your goals 39.130642 
so to start with let's click on file and
go to document properties  43.770695 so by default 45.112104 
we have this nice a4 page  47.909718 which is 210
millimeters by 2 and writing 7 51.744573 
millimeters and then when you go to
document properties the first thing it
has your display units by default 56.652558  it's
millimeters 58.024371  if you're designing
something for print  59.716375 and you're in Europe
you'll want to do millimeters 63.017706  if you're
in USA you want to do inches 65.354105  that's if
you're designing print if you're
designing something that's just only
going to exist on a computer monitor
like in a video  73.786902 or if you're doing like
an animation or a webpage 77.306024  you're gonna
want to do px you're gonna wanna does it
be designing in pixels 80.698858  so it just
depends first  82.650395 let's do we'll just okay
we'll do pixels first 86.757832  so let's say you
want to do pixels  88.439199 so pixels you're never
gonna want to do an a4 in pixels  92.008020 because
a4 is a paper size
so when pixels you're gonna want to do 95.929190 
you come down here to custom size and
you'll probably want to do something
like 1920 by 1080 oh and what I forgot
to do is 106.726040  so this is general settings
this shows us that this will change our
measurement here for pixels  112.462064 and it'll
show all of our global measurements for
pixels pixels  115.440101 but under this custom size
we have a different way to control our
units as well 120.527907  so we want to change this
to pixels    also 122.128703  so yeah well you'll want
to make sure that these always match  124.636823 and
so now we want our width to be 1920 by
1080 133.267248 
so there we have it so this now our
display region I hit the plus sign and
zoom in  138.284832 this box is the size of a
standard computer monitor or a standard
HDTV 145.470851  it's 1080p 1920 pixels wide by 1080
pixels tall  150.920330 so if we're designing
something for like an HDTV might have an
animation 155.108599  or just a picture or a desktop
background like a wallpaper for your
desktop  159.404557 this is the a great design a
great layout to have 162.792512  we can change the
background so by default it's a white
background if we check this 168.187290  we can have
a checkered background 169.536290  and then we can
see kind of give you a better idea 172.636202 
especially if you're not printing on
white paper 174.936259  it gives you an idea of how
things will look 176.952146  because then you know I
see so now you can draw a white object 180.852178 
and it won't especially if there's no
stroke like if we just make or if we
make our stroke white 186.300269  and I guess that
wasn't pure white but so now we can
actually draw white objects without it
getting lost in the background if this
isn't checked  194.835961 then it becomes lost 196.212161  so
you might sometimes want to want to have
it be a transparent background like this 199.920192 
let's see that's about it  204.560291 yeah we you
can change yeah that's about all  208.880458 that we
want to do and then if you hit this
button here  211.060250 it just like shrinks the doc
over here so it's still open  215.247327 and a lot
of times I show that because sometimes
while that shrunk 219.368536  if you want to get
back into it I mean if you go to file
and go back into document properties 223.664873 
nothing happens it does it  225.488518 doesn't bring
that window up  226.888659 and it's can be confusing
that's because it's docked to the side
over here 231.380530  so if ever you dock this it'll
still appear here  234.200964 and any other options
that we bring up can be docked as well 237.188143 
if we hit the X it'll just close it  239.928316 and
then we can bring it back up by going
into our document properties 243.387459  okay let's
try another one  245.941530 so if we go to file new
it actually brings up a whole brand new
window  250.172004 and it just has this in a for for
some reason 252.224780  I've got Find and Replace up
by default 254.287113  and my fill and stroke  255.218142 so I
can dock both of these 257.187527  and now they're
just appear over here  258.931339 I can bring up
whichever one I want to  260.235315 but I want to
change this from a four to something
else
so I go to file 265.455646 
properties bring that up and this time I
do want to print something in the USA 271.459382  so
my display units I want to be in inches 273.543277 
and my units for my well I'm not gonna
set a custom size  277.919528 okay maybe I am a new
custom size  279.223408 I lied so 280.875294  I'll go down to
custom size and I'll do width  282.962254 all the 36
inches by 36 inches 287.313750  so what that's going
to do is create 289.731139  kind of a poster 36
inches by 36 inches 292.990760  it's a completely
square poster  294.737487 maybe my local printer has
a nice foam board or something that I
want to print to 300.201075  and that's the
dimension of the of the board 302.418682  so I can
design something on here 305.090454  maybe I'll have
like a I want to say 307.902447  yard sale and I
want to have like a design like a nice
big banner for my yard sale 314.686377  and have
like all kinds of stars  317.378469 and different
fun things  319.158603 so I would design this and I
would have it printed  322.750244 at my local
printer this is 36 by 36 325.894634  something to
can't do can we see dpi here I guess we
can't  330.775183 so if you're if you're done thing
with printing you know there's a setting
called dpi  334.554329 which is like dots per inch
or that sometimes it's called like PPI
pixels per inch  339.614226 I think there's one I
think that exists 342.310221  so we'll see that in a
second in fact I guess we'll just do it
now  345.802219 so let's say we want to actually
print this 347.815620  if we click this checkered
background we see okay  351.262552 so this is
actually printing on whatever so
whatever color that maybe it's a yellow
poster board  356.334321 so it'll print on whatever
color it is and no other color will be
printed  359.590554 whereas if we did draw an actual
square 363.730453  and color it white and then rip
it and lower it to the bottom 369.086361  we see
this is what it looks like so is
actually sometimes printers can print a
white color 375.558395  a good example would be
maybe you're printing this on the back
of a shirt I like a black shirt  380.546117 well if
you print black ink on the back of a
black shirt it's not going to show up so
you might actually want to print a white
color  386.882307 on the back of the shirt and then
a red star and black text  390.226230 so sometimes
you will want to actually draw white so
just keep that in mind
if you were if you're designing on a
transparent background 396.254153  or if you're
actually printing color in this case 400.778671  I'm
assuming I'm gonna print a 36 by 36 on
like a white foam board so I don't need
to I don't need to draw a white color in
let's  410.690209 let's export this as if we were
going to send this to the printer 414.394463  so to
do that we go to file  416.622254 if we go to save
it'll save our document 419.258628  which is a good
idea to do too it'll save it as a dot
SVG file  423.026122 sometimes the printers
professional printers will actually want
to have the SVG file  428.418180 so sometimes it's a
good idea to send both  431.102329 so I'm gonna do
that I'm gonna click Save and we'll just
go to the desktop and we'll call this
yard 438.565681 
SVG so yard and then saved as an
Inkscape SVG  442.279059 we can also save it as a
plain SVG maybe for worried about
compatibility issues 446.285493  with the printer
and then they could actually open this
up in Illustrator or they can open it up
in you can maybe even open these up in
like and Photoshop 459.287733  I'm not sure but
lots of programs there they're printing
software can probably open vector art it
can open dot SVG files  465.158371 so we could send
this and then that way they when the
printer opens it up they might be like
oh you know what your star for whatever
reason was off the border 472.594441  so I'll fix it
for you so they like  474.258216 they can drag it
over and move it  476.550273 without having to get
crazy  478.602242 because the other way we export it
is as a as like maybe a PNG image  484.118192 so we
go to file and go export PNG image 486.506459 
that'll bring up some more options
towards the right tier 489.830358  so this will be
called yard dot PNG is what it is by
default it's on my desktop which is
great if I want to put it somewhere else
I can change the location by clicking
this  498.406340 export as and then the export
button is what I'll export it 501.906311  so if I
just leave everything how  504.193030 it is now well
okay so our export area by default it's
drying  509.489236 so if I hit export let's just see
what that looks like  511.227825 so we minimize
close out of this one we do earlier 516.271894  so
now we see it exported out 519.035898  it doesn't
look too bad  520.092075 we have a white border on
our star which I didn't realize we had 524.327858 
and then we have artists black text  525.824009 so
that's what it'll look like 527.439932 
but it's important to know what this is
doing so let's say we have our star
selected  533.423651 and now when we go to export
like automatically it changed this to
selection  538.768056 so now if I if I hit export 541.439773 
and we minimize now it only exported the
star 545.215929 
it only exported what was selected  547.327011   so
now we have this thing that says  548.746672   yard so
we have this thing that's just the star 550.482551 
did you see what I did there if I just
if I just click this text 554.870909  and I go to
selection  555.854864 and export it'll just export
whatever is selected  559.270867 and if I hit ctrl H
if I if and click the start 563.910804  and select
both of them 565.082670  I can export both of them 566.882806 
but it's going to export so I have just
the text there 571.058704  I can export just both of
them together  573.398760 replace it sure we'll
replace this one  576.166803 so now we have two
different ones but 580.386748  they're different one
of them is just the selection  582.166927 in fact
both these actually these are the same
because it's that did the drawing  587.274774 but
what I really want to do  588.718692 let's I'll show
you for an extreme example let's shrink 591.122752 
this down to the middle 592.498716  if we export
page that's almost always what you're
gonna want to do if you're doing things
properly  596.654691 when you export the page it
exports the page these lines  600.418681 the page
area  601.742456 so now if I hit export it'll export
the entire page lines  606.890838 and anything
inside them 609.093502  so now our poster looks like
this  610.985769 even that's kind of hard to see
let's open it up 616.713893  then we'll open it up
in so we can kind of see exactly
what it looks like it'll have a
transparent background  623.749703 and just that
text in that star 627.281773  so this is what our
poster will look like when it's printed
but it'll have white  632.000376 in the back   

633.069084  instead
am i making sense here for you 

637.988793  so if we
do just drawing  I think just drawing is
going to be basically the limits of just
the drawing  643.824853 so we'll call this yard I'll
call it yard one  go to export 648.700685  and it's a
good idea for you to do just what I'm
doing now  651.004598 and playing around 651.836790  so yard one
looks like this  653.200829 it's just the limits of
the drawing 656.358397  so it exports every draw
knocked every object I can find  659.912516 I'm
going to close that 661.328523  every object it can
find 662.736602 
just gonna it's going to basically
export with this   dotted line around it 667.584616 
if this star were over here  668.951517 it would it
would export just this shape  671.588486 and it
wouldn't do the page borders 673.492289  so pay
close attention to that that can kind of
throw a lot of people off 677.128992  because you
know you might actually 679.940389  accidentally
have just this selected and you export
it  683.128614 and you forget to double check it  685.544615 and
then you upload that file to the printer 687.834873 
you upload this and say hey can you
print this yardsale poster and they just
print this  692.414446 and it's not 36 by 36 inches
it's not the right size you wanted 696.610646  and
it just won't turn out so well  699.775584 so play
with all these play with page drawing
selection custom you can actually change
these numbers  705.810488 and export it you know
choose your X&Y so you could actually
export an object sitting clear over here
outside of the page border  713.050306 but you could
custom lis tell it to go to that point
that X&Y point if you wanted to probably
don't want to  720.586639 okay and then what does
this say to is if you're printing always 724.190501 
you'll want this to be your pixels at
your DPI 96 is good for web 731.978380  but if
you're printing something you want to be
at least 150 and I like to do 300
actually  737.642587 so I change this to 300  740.042532 and
what that does is makes a much larger
file size so if I go to page 744.890429  and ice and
then I change this to 300  747.622582 then I go to
export this is going to be it takes a
lot longer 753.318529  if you notice whoa it's
taking forever because it's 36 inches by
36 inches is quite large 759.094495  it's a lot of
information  760.514618 so this exports out which
one what do I call that is it this one
here  764.602489 I think it is so I was taking a
little bit longer low because it's such
a large file 770.026229  but it still looks the same 771.498603 
but if we go to properties we see this
files well 775.122225  it's not huge 628 kilobytes
properties of this 196 so I guess 781.998733  it's
not huge but I took a long time to
render  784.610473 because we have it at 300 dpi 787.714231  so
anytime you're printing something
whether it's on a t-shirt business card
poster even a printer page icon a
regular printer at home  795.514233 you want this to
be 300 dpi 797.454271 
it just gives you better resolution
that's for every inch that you're
printing it has 300 dots  803.618380 instead of the
default was 96 dots 806.708619  so it's gonna be
three times as detailed  809.206995 basically if
you're doing web it doesn't really
matter 812.954373  because web 96 is is plenty fine
for a computer monitor computer screen 819.026443 
but just know that printers can print at 
a higher resolution 822.322639  usually then in hex
export the width and the height to so
this is gonna be uniform because we're
36 by 36  830.698493 what else 832.458404  that's about it with
the export settings  835.058428 so this video is
getting kind of long 837.094520  but hopefully
that's 837.871683  you know shed some light on that 839.263714 
on how to create different document
sizes  843.203340 different settings and then
exporting so that you get 845.527669  the result
that you're wanting  846.792215 appreciate you
watching 848.283649  I'll see you on the next video 849.775567  849.775567  849.775567
