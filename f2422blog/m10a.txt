 1.789781 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial  5.289864 in this video we're going to
quickly be showing the bezzie a tool 8.426211  to
trace a physical object 10.573729  an object in
like an actual real picture 13.354055  and we'll
trace that to create some vector art of
that object 17.022179  so I'm going to do a more
complex object I'm going to do this
picture that I found on pixabay  22.249975 if we
just go to pixabay.com I can show you
how I found this 25.924526  pixabay is a great site
for finding free photos 28.783826  that you can use
for both sometimes commercial and
obviously personal purposes  34.200575 we'll just
type in person  35.552764 and we can scroll down
here 37.776615  and I've chose this picture of this
guy falling  40.357052 so this is shared with us by
the user pixels 43.380704  and it's under Creative
Commons 0 license free for commercial
use no attribution required 48.288467  so we'll go
ahead and download this 49.548638  I already have
it downloaded go ahead and download the
nineteen twenty by twelve sixty click
download here  54.092564 and then it'll appear in
your downloads folder  55.968509 so that's this
picture here called action 58.456709  it's just a
guy kind of following  60.683849 and what we're
gonna do I want to bring this in so I'll
go back to my downloads  65.159782 and I want to
actually drag this into Inkscape so
we'll left-click and drag it into
Inkscape  70.196192 we'll leave all these settings
the same this just says we're going to
embed the image  so it's part of our
project file  75.694815 rather than linking it
externally 77.589576  if we link it and then we go
back and delete that file out of our
downloads  81.681830 then it won't show up here and
in that you scape 83.673208  which is probably fine
since we're just tracing it anyway  86.153021 but
I'll just leave it here 87.549170  so one bed and
then we'll leave everything   else the
same  90.528417 so now we have this picture 92.376198  and
actually there's a I think there might
be a faster way to do what I'm about to
show you 96.939219  I know there is actually 97.983322  but
I'm just gonna show you for using the
Bezier tool  102.014704 it's a really good practice
for learning how that Tool Works 104.102653  so I
wanted to scale this up but I forgot to
do one thing 107.547729  right now
it's it'll skew it if I scale it unless
I'm really really accurate so I'll hit
ctrl C 112.588705  or I could hold the ctrl key
while I scale and then it stays uniform 116.576802 
but what I'd like to do is click this
lock at the top  120.064746 and what it does if you
hover over it it says it makes it so
height and width scale the same  126.957683 whether
you're holding the ctrl key or not  128.457364 and
just helps when you're working with
photos and when you're working with text 132.049336 
I always like to have that checked 133.793815 
well you don't accidentally secure
something without realizing it  136.630013 okay so
we have this picture  138.706242 and then we're just
gonna go to our desi a tool 141.214209  make sure if
you are playing with this playing along
with the last videos you might have this
on the lips or something make sure your
shape is to none  149.174373 and make sure your mode
is set to regular  151.606237 and then we're going
to hit the plus key  154.574244 I'll use my control
wheel to kind of pan around 157.346220  hit the plus
key and we're going to start right at
the tip of this boot  160.606046 and what we're
doing is I want to create an outline 163.154196  so
we're gonna draw just the outline 166.114445  and
I'm not gonna you could come down here
and click and hold  169.377618 and then create like
that nice rounded toe  171.470547 and maybe that'd
be an OK thing  173.422069 and then this one comes
here and we can round that in a little
bit  176.098468 I'm not gonna do too much of that 177.530491 
I'm just gonna be clicking and create
kind of a little bit more jagged but
we're so zoomed in it's not you're not
really gonna notice  183.894133 and I'll pause the
video here in a second and speed up so
we don't have to watch this whole
process  188.890125 but essentially I'm just left
clicking creating some nodes every time
that there's enough contour in this
image  195.062191 and we're going to create a nice
outline like a black shadow outline of
this like a silhouette of a person
falling  203.098138 and we could use it in like a
logo 206.010428  or we could use this silhouette for
I don't know some print art or different
kinds of things that we want to do 212.747561  so
I'll pause now too but just kind of
follow along and do the same thing 216.886579  I'll
pause the video and speed it up  218.458777 and I'll
get back with you when I'm completed
with this silhouette shape 222.418488 
[Music]
 245.804103 
okay I'm just about completing the last
part of the heel of the shoe here  250.259362 and
don't worry if you mess up I'm gonna
mess up intentionally right here like if
you accidentally click in there or like
out here  256.999235 don't worry about it because we
can fix that afterwards 259.663636  I'm just gonna
complete my shape  261.127306 and click my very
first point that I started with  263.763172 and then
we have this nice outline  266.615250 and so your
stroke might not be that large but if we
zoom out here we can see 270.699341 it's a it's
created an outline stroke of this whole
person here 276.171154  so right now our fill is
transparent and our stroke is completely
black  280.478383 but if we hit black we can turn
our fill to black  284.414080 and we can come down
to our stroke we can hold down shift and
hit none go to the transparent so now we
have no stroke  292.086135 and we have just a black
fill  293.506407 let's see that for it's kind of a
cool 295.858360  we have a nice silhouette  297.946216 and then
we can go in and fix any parts we messed
up on by just going to the node edit
tool  302.422305 zoom in and we can replace these
nodes about where they should be we can
hit the Delete key and delete a node 308.874065  if
we think we have too many there  310.258192 we can
grab some of these handles if there's a
rounded part like we did here 314.246077  and we can
adjust the way that this boot fits a
little bit  318.041989 when I make it a little more
big in the toe  320.258237 we can actually make it
bigger than it really is if we want to 323.407017 
we can we don't have to follow the
outline exactly  326.158334 so we can check through 327.301809 
and see but you know I went I went
through pretty jagged  330.109562 this is like part
of the shirt 331.473890  that I've brought in it's
not really a mistake but we can bring it
in if we want to  335.625715 if we don't like the
way that looks we can kind of bring that
in a little bit 338.841878  I don't like the way
that looks at all anyway  343.153821 when we zoom
out and so what we can do is we can grab
this 346.285831  now and we can move it around  348.277667 so
now we have this actual shape and then
we can take left-click and we can then
delete our original hit the Delete key 353.905750 
and then we're left with just this
silhouette 356.869654  and we can change the color
of it any cover we want 360.449642  we can have it
be we can give it a separate stroke if
we hold down the shift key we can give
it a like a blue stroke  366.405690 and have it be
yellow 368.213823 
I'll hit ctrl zieks I don't really like
that blue stroke  370.417821 we can
Espie blue  373.193634 and then we can yeah we can
do anything that we could do with any
other path so we can resize it 380.073719  we can
click again we can rotate it if we want
to have it be little bit different  383.694400 so
it's just a really cool thing we can
apply a gradient under the gradient tool
here we can just draw in a gradient 389.169718 
maybe we can let on to be kind of like
that so it like goes fades into alpha 393.433587 
and then we can put some text on here
and we can grab like a you know a
different color background or something
and very quickly we can create a nice
cool little effect  402.193741 and the best part is
it's all vector image  405.221672 so I'll hit
control Z ctrl Z ctrl Z  408.077749 when I have a
source like this sometimes  I want to
duplicate it  410.837686 so I'll hit ctrl D and I'll
keep my original here  413.521858 and that way if I
make any changes to this one and ever I
want to get back I can just grab my
original  419.017701 one change you you could make
for example we can go to path and go to
simplify 425.497164  now just reduce the amount of
nodes we have and kind of smooth things
out  428.873212 that doesn't look super great now
see there's not as much detail in the
head anymore 433.320188 
it's Liston's it's still I think it
looks more realistic 436.206489  so I'll delete this
one  437.050613 so we can hit control D on our
keyboard again and get another version
here 441.459664  and actually it's a lot of times
I'll do that so if we take this 445.062730  I'm
getting kind of carried away now but if
we go ctrl D  448.161227 and then make this one
black 449.561250 and push the down arrow key a
couple times  and the over arrow key  453.532915  now
we have like an outline 454.909842  so that blue
outline behind  456.649419 and then we can send this
black one to the very back 458.709382  and then we
kind of have a blue with a black outline
is kind of cool  462.273327 or sometimes if I'll
draw like a nice background like this 466.885494 
and I'll select the black if I can I'll
hit what's it alt 472.269508 
alt click because I'm clicking back now
because this gray was on top of it 476.533702  and
we can turn that to white 479.397464  we can't see
it ctrl Z ctrl Z let's take our shift
let's take this and sync it all the way
back to the back 487.229343  and then let's grab
just this black one and let's make it
white  490.525392 and then I'll go to object we'll
go to or we go to path no good object
yeah fill and Stroke properties 498.045544  and go
make bring up the blur 500.925352  so we have like a
blurred out version of it in the back 503.681514 
it's like a full black 506.214015  turn the opacity
all the way up to black 509.177582  so yeah then we
have that's pretty cool right so we have
a kind of a cool thing  512.005440 I'm trying to
zoom in here 515.030304  yeah like this little bit
darker or a darker blue 520.811265  so that's some
pretty cool things that you can do with
the with the Bezier tool you can trace
any object take a picture of it bring it
in here or find a picture online you can
trace it  530.518030 and you can do some pretty cool
stuff with it  533.237488 like this 534.448552  so I hope you
enjoyed this video hopefully this kind
of kind of spurred on some inspiration
you can see maybe of some different
things you can do with this  541.916418 we'll use
this a little bit later on too in other
videos 544.812651  but that's an example of using
the Bezier tool to trace objects in a
real image 550.136550  thanks for watching we'll
catch you on the next one 552.364664  552.364664  552.364664
