memory game is a simple concentration
game 2.254036  in which the player flips over two
cards 4.436802  in the hopes that it's a match  5.793832 as
soon as the player flips over all the
cards  and they're all matched  10.042808   the player
has one  11.118615 and I tried to find out a little
bit more about the history of the memory
game 16.434305  but there are just so many
variations 18.236618  I even found someone the
internet claiming that Mark Twain  20.911107 and
made up the memory game 22.036459  after googling
this it turns out he did make some sort
of a memory game  25.907729  it looks more like a
tax collection game  28.457389 that's the internet
for you 30.560042 
we are gonna be concentrating today on
the set attribute 35.219225  and get attribute
inbuilt  JavaScript functions 38.507207  as well as
event listeners what else scent of all 43.579497 
we've got sometimes going on math.random 46.665846 
and sort so if you're interesting
learning more about those  49.376527 especially set
attribute and get attribute  52.174645 please watch
my video 54.114599  as always
minimal styling 56.062354  I don't want to sit for
hours so feel free to go wild on your
own 60.068294  this one's particularly garish and
yeah  63.889451 okay 68.077614  so let's set up a folder to
have our app.js file 71.609927  index.html file
style.css file 75.151015  in the root 76.270902  along with an
images folder 78.255845  for all the images we are
going to use 80.224348  please make sure to have
the images as 100 pixel by a hundred
pixel squares 86.374393  to avoid of stretching and
tampering with them later 89.365141  after saving
your images simply drag and drop them
into your folder 94.438814  I have chosen to go for
six fast foods 97.996342  a blank for when my card
is on its front and a white PNG file to
simulate the board space being empty 106.010695  now
in our HTML boilerplate 110.950151  we need to put a
h3 tag in the body 113.866704  along with a span of
ID result 115.949607  our live score will show up in
here 120.497362 
next we create a div with the class name
of grid 128.412215  this is where our game grid will
be created 131.049131  don't forget to link up your
star CSS file an app.js file with these
tags  136.188813 now flip over to your CSS file  139.600831 and
add some styling to your grid  141.167588 because I
can't out 100 pixels by 100 pixels  144.237815 we
would be able to make a three by four
square grid  147.290286 now flip over to a app.js
file  150.556295 all our JavaScript code will be
done in this Dom event listen up from
now on 155.675637  let's start by making an array of
cards  158.300353 and giving them names that we will
use later 160.437813 I'm gonna make two of each as
we need two of each card  164.296180 in our array to
play the game 165.892166  you will see here that I
am simply naming the card  174.808039 and for the
image I'm writing the relative relative
path to each image  179.741440 okay now we're gonna
create our game board 185.889558  first using query
selector  190.195250 I'm gonna pick out the element
with the class name of grade for my HTML 194.113957 
and define it as grid for our JavaScript 196.998969 
now using a for loop 203.198514 
I'm gonna loop over my card array  206.007607 and
for each card I'm going to create an
image element  209.123412 I'm going to call this
element card 211.243706  for each card I'm going to
set a set as an attribute  218.586177 linking it to
the image with relative path image blank
PNG  226.704771 I'm also going to give each one a
date idea 232.187401  and loop over each one to give
them an ID that goes from 0 to 11 237.051686  as we
had 12 cards in total in our card array 239.207015 
we will then add an event listener to
listen out to if the cards have been
clicked on  246.110893 and invoke a flip card
function of a comment this out for now
as we have not written this function 253.208965 
quite yet 254.502117 
finally all these cards or technically
lint image elements with different IDs
we've created  261.110870 you're going to put into
the dev with a class name of grid using
append child 267.169963 
now let's invert the function and flip
over to our browser 274.021550  and done let's carry
on 276.337831  so to make our game work  we need to
do two more things 280.440642 
check for matched  281.675721 and flip your cards 283.198442 
let's start by writing flip card as we
saw in our function above  288.056719 let's set a
variable of card ID  292.372342 in this we are
simply getting the data ID attributes 299.572931  we
created in the create mode function
above  301.881933 we will now make an empty array of
cards chosen  308.697851 using push we will push the
cards from the card array based on that
card ID  315.127307 so if the card ideas for this
will match the fifth card in our Cod
array  319.761457 once we have located this card  321.964042 we
will get its name  323.513112 we are going to do the
same to push the card ID in a separate
for now empty array  328.687058 for this one we just
want the ID 331.770436  now because flip card is
already in a function  338.131206 we taking already
have a card picked 340.316354  this set attribute
will let us add an image to that square 345.723383 
based on the card ID
it holds 348.163134  we only want to put two cards
in our cards chosen array 352.615492  so with this
if statement we are saying that if the
cards chosen array is equal to two 358.037873  we
want to invoke the function for check
for match  361.775786 this set timeout will give us
some buffer times so the whole thing
doesn't happen too quickly  368.327351 I want to
check for a match after exactly 500
milliseconds 372.620752 
okay now let's write the check for match
function  376.150978 let's pick up all the images
that we created in our first function
using query selector all 381.873042  and call them
carts 383.143654  now we have two values in our
cards chosen array  387.330297 
as well as our cards chosen ID array at
this point  391.260818 let's use both the values
here like this  395.103448 and set them as constant 396.972133 
by writing card chose an ID  400.957077 and then a
zero and square brackets 403.195988  I am saying I
want the first value in my array  406.008482 and I
want to assign it to the constant option
one ID  410.098618 do the same for the second value 412.369819 
using the same logic but for cards
chosen so their names rather than the
IDS  418.666486 I'm gonna check that the first item
in my array 421.710749  deeply equals the second
item in my cards chosen array 425.833810  if the
answer is true 427.606304  I want an alert I want an
alert to pop up  430.699048 and I want to assign
both of them a white PNG for styling  435.381655 I
also want to make another empty array
called cards  442.509795 one and push the two chosen
cards into the array to be stored  446.694557 if the
cause don't match I want to flip the
card back over to be played again  456.485895 so
visually giving them a blank PNG and
send a lot 460.383809 

 469.180815 either way if either of these two things
happen  472.331563 I still want to clear the cards
chosen array  475.397300 and the cards chose an ID
array  478.543513 ready to start flipping again  480.837685 so
now we are collecting cards 1  486.701154 and we
could convert this into a score 488.775576  and
display this to the user via the browser 490.819680 
by picking out the span element with the
ID result from our HTML 496.252038  we can do this
using text content 499.169611  you can pass through
exactly how many times we have stored
something in our cards 1 array 508.869385  so one
point for every month 511.673670  if the cards 1
deeply equal the length of our cards
array divided by 2  518.801085 we know we have
collected all the possible cards in our
cards array  522.710110 let other alert the user of
this via the browser  526.136346 like this  527.863556 now the
final thing that will allow us to
refresh the game with new compositions
is to randomize all cards array 539.564237  let's do
this using sort and math.random 543.602513 
and there you have it your very own
memory game  552.811583 again I'm not going to town
on styling simply because otherwise we
would be here for way too long 559.747319  but
please have a go yourself comment below
if you have any questions  563.855664 and yeah let
me know if you have any other ideas for
games I can make Kamali's thanks
