Hi and welcome back to the JavaScript games course.
 25.270748 
In this tutorial,

we're going to be coding Connect Four As well as focusing on onClick events for this game,
 33.303540 
if you haven't watched the two previous tutorials before this,
 37.780102 
I strongly recommend you do,
 39.302602 
we're going to be using things like query selectors and event listeners that we did cover in the previous ones.
  45.309998 
So if you're not comfortable with them,

please watch those videos before attempting this one.
 49.814581 
As always, we're gonna do simple styling.
 51.882183  
This is so that you can get the project make your own.
 55.840433 
So I'm literally gonna be focusing maybe like max five minutes on the stylesheet.
 59.938870 
Connect for is a simple grid based game in which you as the user have to drop a chip down into one of the columns to take your place.
 70.395016 
After you take in your place,
 72.216828 
the second player will take their turn,
 74.746183 
please bear in mind for this game,
 76.566391 
obviously, we can't really have gravity.
 79.010766 
So we're just going to use the bottom grid as the you know,

bottom grid.
 83.009683 
Meaning that if you want to put a chip in a chip in a space that doesn't have a chip below it,
  88.389973  
you're not going to be able to write so the point of the game is to get four in a row.
 94.979703 
This is either in a column or row but also diagonally.
 98.484244 
The first place to do this wins.
 99.961453 
Okay, so let's get going.
 102.488828 
Okay, so first,

let's set up our project with the correct files in our folder.
 112.583057 
We will have the app j s for our JavaScript index HTML for our HTML code,
 120.492348 
and style CSS for our CSS styling.
 123.107432 
In your HTML file,
 126.381578 
add a div with a class name of grid with enough divs inside to make a seven by six grid.
 132.035911 
So 42 divs.
 134.269473 
We also need to add seven more depth to the bottom with the class name token.
 139.274828 
This will be the bottom of our grid.
 142.755203 
Add a span with the ID current players so we can display the current player to the user like this.
 154.263890
And also one final result so we can see who wins in the event of a win.
 162.079993 
Always make sure to link your cell sheet and JavaScript file in the HTML file.
 172.084889 
Okay, now flip over to your CSS file and add the following styling to make our list of divs and the div with a class name grid lockback and actual grid,
 185.090243 
we use Flexbox to wrap the divs into a grid square.
 189.597431 
We will also be parsing our player one and player two colors here like this.
  198.598785 
Okay, now flip over to your JavaScript file and add a DOM event listener like this.
 207.336743 
All your JavaScript code will be done in the event listener from now on.
 211.337077 
   232.808055 
Okay, so the first thing we are going to do is write a function that will listen out for every time we click a square and our grid.
 240.523117 
We will start off by writing a loop to loop over each square,
 244.533346 
then a function to add an onClick to it.
 247.503929
  256.751074 
Now let's write some if statements.
 258.318574 
So what we are writing here is that if you click on a div and the div below it or seven squares down,
 266.327470 
has a class name of taken you are allowed to click on this stuff and claim it as you will take and go.
 272.868554
  
  281.808470 
Right so if you can go and if you are playing one at a class name have taken to that square.
 291.687657 
Also add a class name of player one to that square,
 294.708177 
so we can visually see where you have chosen to place your go in the browser.
 299.707427 
 310.384844 
I'll do the same for player two.
 313.895719 
 324.353531 
If you aren't in a square that is one out from one with the class.
  
taken an alert saying you can't go here will pop up.
 333.698780 
Now let's open our browser to see if this works.
 339.021405 
Okay, great.
 343.029551 
Now let's check the board for win or lose with a chalkboard function.
 348.027405 
First, we need to declare what a winning combination actually is on our board.
 353.038634 
I actually found these somewhere online.
 356.519593 
So I have cheated,

and I'm passing this on to you.
   359.477530 
So you don't have to figure this out ourselves.

Otherwise, we'll be here all day.
 363.120530 
Okay, now again,
 
using a loop, we are essentially plugging in values to the squares on our grid.
 369.125738 
This is so we can check if these squares are in a winning array and also contain the class name at playout.
  
One.
 379.784342
 422.769258 

If the answer is true,
 424.055591 
we want to display player one wins in the inner HTML the span with ID result on our HTML page.
 430.925570 
Okay, do the same for player two like this.
 436.425924 
 458.143589 
Finally, on each click of the squares in our grid,
 462.151860 
we want to add an event listener and pass through the check board function.
 466.121797 
This means the function will run every time you press on a square in the grid.
 473.166714 
Okay, there you have it.
 478.129693 
Thanks for listening.
 479.660839 
If you have any questions,
 481.642922 
please do let me know.
