Hey, welcome back.
 6.053990 
We are currently at game five out of seven of the JavaScript games course.
11.554149  
In this tutorial,
 12.562834 
we're going to be learning how to build Space Invaders and other JavaScript,
  16.976666  
HTML and CSS Grid based game.
 20.358366 
By building Space Invaders,

we're going to be concentrating on the switch ghosts.
 24.374783 
This is going to be massive throughout the whole game.
 26.383536 
So if you're interested in learning more about the switch goes,

please watch this video.
 30.786575 
Space Invaders is really simple,
 33.276915 
you're going to be a user or shooter that moves along from one side of the grid to the other in a 15 by 15 grid square.
 41.795350 
Your goal is to shoot all the little invaders.
 44.285237 
So all the little ones coming down.
 46.783355 
They're going down like this before they get to you.
 49.288729 
So technically, it is a time game.
 51.293695 
There's not too much of a countdown,
 52.812652 
but obviously the invaders moving down is a countdown in itself.
 55.800158 
This means we're going to be using a lot of set interval and clear interval to 
 61.176439 
as always minimal styling for you to take and make your own.
 64.993627 
So yeah, let's get going.
  67.955668  
So as always, let's make sure to link up your style CSS file with a link tag and app js file with a script tag in your HTML file.
 83.380407 
Let's start off by adding an h3 tag where we can display our score.
 88.867323 
Let's add a span with an ID of result here so we can display the score as well as play our game.
 95.864738 
Next, let's add a div with a class name of grid.
 100.224942 
In it, we will put 11 by 11.
 104.725191 
Actually, let's make it bigger.
 108.206393 
Let's make a 15 by 15 squares for our game.
 110.734148 
So a total of 225 days that we will start as squares in our style CSS.
 117.217595 
Let's flip over to that.
Now.
 124.235282 
Let's apply some styling to our grid to make it look like an actual grid,
 131.151948 
as well as the grid divs inside of it.
 134.867957 
We are using a width and a height of 300 pixels here,
 138.824964 
meaning that the height and the width of our squares need to be 20 pixels in order to make sure 15 squares fit on a line before being wrapped over themselves.
 148.534170 
To make a second row.
 150.048207 
We might as well assign a color to future classes,
 155.010542 
we will use our shooter invader boom for when they shoot hits an invader and the laser.
 161.548955 
Let's open the HTML file path in our browser to check that looks fine.
 169.530361 
Okay, great.
 176.044669 
Now let's go to our app js file.
 177.523785 
We start off by adding a DOM event listener.
 180.034873 
All our JavaScript code will go inside this event listener from now on.
 184.520814 
Now let's pick out the classes and IDs we have defined using query selectors.
 189.273217 
As there's more than one element that is considered a div in inside the element with the class own grid,
 197.777389 
we need to make sure to use query selector all for the squares.
 202.291675 
Also note how we use the hash when we pick out our ID names,
 208.325893 
rather than the dot for class name.
 210.829997 
Now let's let our JavaScript know that we want the width of the grid to be 15 
 216.096687 
that we want the shooter to start at index 202 in our squares array,
 222.174646 
and our invaded start at index zero or collectively invaders.
 228.179997 
I'll explain that later.
 229.696142 
We are going to leave an empty array for the invaders we have shot down.
 234.476278 
Let's resolve zero for now.
 237.485258 
And let the direction we want to go in be a one.
  241.080700  
Again, I will explain that later.
 243.597888 
And finally, let's leave the invader ID as null for now.
 248.098976 
Now let's define our alien invaders as how we would want them to appear in our squares array.
 257.597457 
So by saying these are the indexes we want our alien invader to be in,
 265.116777 
we can easily see this on our grid by adding a color class name to them.
 269.099929 
So let's do this using for each like this.
 273.624509 
So in the array alien invaders,
 280.900881 
for each item in the array,
 283.404895 
we will choose to call invader I will pass this through our squares 
 289.834554 
and any current index value there might be so in this case zero.
 294.253353 
And then I want to add a class list I'm invada to that square.
 300.742922 
We set this up purple as purple in our style sheet.
 305.752355 
So let's see if that works.
 306.743353 
Let's flip over to a browser puppet it works.
 312.285416 
Now the best part of this is that we can control all the positions of all the invaders in our alien array.
 319.661992 
Thanks to the current invader index,
 322.671947 
try this yourself by changing the value from zero to five in your file.
 326.175348 
Okay, let's do the same for shooter flip over to our browser to check and let's carry on.
 338.169929 
Now we need to make our shooter move across the grid but not go up or down.
 344.685371 
For this we're gonna look at key codes which are the codes given to the keys on your keyboard.
 350.171607 
Let's write a function called move shooter and pass through E for event.
 357.196346 
Let's start off by clearing the board of the shooter by removing the class name on the shooters current location index 202 as we sit above 
 365.217888 
now using switch cases we will make a case for key code that is seven or the left arrow on your keyboard and that you nine to the right.
 376.734010 
So the case that is seven if the shooters current index is divisible by the width so 15 
 383.297638 
and leaves a remain leader remainder is allowed to move left.
 388.883057 
So for example if you're going to square with index 30,
 391.893964 
you will know you're on the very left side of the grid as that is divisible by 15 
 396.890381 
and it's not good give you any remainders.
 399.482921 
As you have no remainder you cannot move left anymore.
 402.972173 
That's what we've written.
 404.458136 
Now for case 39 if the shooters current index is in a Square index where the number is divisible by the width.
 410.487683 
So 15 and the number is less than 14,
 413.980880 
then you are allowed to move right.
 415.987955 
Then once it is done at a class of shooter to the new location of the shooter on the grid Finally,
 426.870154 
Finally, let's add an event listener for the key down action 
 433.891401 
that triggers the move shooter function each time you put one of the keys we discussed down on your keyboard.
 439.663124 
Let's check out the browser to see if this is what.
 442.394779 
Okay, great.
 446.371967 
Now let's move on.
 447.367024 
Let's move the alien invaders from one side of the grid to the other moving down a row each time,
 453.433418 
we will now write a function called move invaders that we'll put,
 457.401627 
we'll put on a time loop.
 458.938679 
First, as above,
 460.903668 
let's define our left edge and our right edge using similar logic,
 463.900765 
but the elite for the alien invaders array.
 466.909949 
This is trickier as many as apply the logic to the first item in the array for checking 
 472.580425 
if we on the left edge and apply the logic the last items the last alien and alien invader array to check if we were at the right edge.
 480.926592 
If we don't do this,
 481.814370 
aliens will just carry on going through and what we see as the right edge and look really weird.
 487.331581 
So make sure to do that.
 491.838883 
Okay, so if we are on the left edge and our direction is minus one,
 496.353055 
so I use minus one here because of the alien was to go back one index in a row,
 501.358701 
it will essentially appear to be going left.
 503.854574 
So if both these things are true,
 506.342669 
or we are at the right edge and the direction is currently plus one,
 510.848951 
we want to get the direction and value of 15.
 513.343100 
So it will move down to whole row on average.
 516.866343 
If the directions already 15 we carry on with the same logic as above.
 522.351581 
So if you're the left or change direction be positive.
 525.873781 
Else carry on going left we're keeping the direction as minus one.
 528.851989 
Now let's move over the alien invader array to move and the invaders.
 536.381558 
loop over again to add a new direction to all the items in the alien array.
 544.866003 
And loop over again to other class of invader to the new location of all the aliens in the array or items.
 552.872103 
Now let's write some logic that decides that the game is over.
 559.853803 
If the square and our current shooter is in has a class name that contains invader and shooter,
 569.858248 
the game is over.
 571.370311 
This is because the alien invader has got to the you know tutor and it's gone to the same square.
 581.116320 
we display the game over in our browser using text content and add a boom class just for fun.
 588.114823 
We also clear the time interval for the game like this.
 592.114120 
We also want to make sure that if any of the aliens Mr.

shooter, but reached the end of the grid,
 602.123485 
the game is over to we do so by declaring that if any aliens are in the last 15 squares of the grid,
 608.127794 
the game is over.
 609.110855
   623.055254 
Now we need to invoke this function every 500 milliseconds like this.
 627.559449 
Let's see how that looks now.
 630.053644 
Okay, great.
 633.581014 
Finally we need to write a function that allows us to shoot at the alien to try when and gain points.
 639.101921 
We will do so by passing through an event or E through our function shoot.
 644.113349 
let's declare laser ideas no and add a new current index for the laser.
 651.107816 
The current index of the laser will always be the current location of the shooter to start with.
 655.591036 
If we write this 
 659.163213 
is what's going to go to the shooter pool.
 661.193009 
These two declarations needs to be an only the scope of this function for this to work by the way,
 668.671059 
make sure that now we will write a function in here called the move laser.
 674.697658 
very similarly we will move the laser from its current starting position and square.
 681.701218 
This time removing the whole width for it to appear to be moving up awkward.
 688.203599 
So minus 50.

MRI other laser close later.
 694.405345 
If the current square the laser is incandescent and VEDA we do three things.
 701.041648 
Remove the laser,
 702.509698 
move the invader and add a boom for fun 
 707.086886 
We only want the moon to appear for a very short time,
 711.514710 
so we can use a timeout for this and make sure to remove the boom after 250 milliseconds.
 717.181308 
We then clear the time interval for this light set.
 724.672125 
Let's make an array of aliens we are taken down like this.
 731.194710 
By writing this we are pushing a new item to our alien invaders take down empty array we declared at the beginning of this video using push.
 742.664619 
We then add one to the result and display this in our browser using text content.
 752.700923 
Lastly, if the laser is in the very first 15 squares,
 760.200469 
we want to clear this interval and remove the laser class from the grid.
 764.197431
    782.563553 
We want all of this to happen when we press the spacebar.
 785.538995 
using logic we learn above we add an event listener on pass through an event or E for the keyCode 32 
 793.164074 
which is a spacebar on your keyboard.
 795.468791 
We then pass through the middle is a function on 100 millisecond interval like this.
 801.480106
  815.576160 
Now that we are counting how many aliens we have taken down,
 819.086319 
we need to add some code above.
 821.579448 
Using bang we are writing here that if the alien takes alien take down array does not include 
 830.063915 
the space you can add an invader class 
 834.073733 
this means that we will not be reacting invaders once they are shot.
 838.976001 
And finally, we need to write some logic to declare a win.
 845.582010 
This is simple if the length of our alien invaders taken down array is equal to the length of our alien invaders 
 852.144323 
we went this is because we have shot all the images 
 857.677565 
 871.640649 
Okay,

now let's flip over to play.
 873.619492 
Okay, I can see it doesn't like my event.

Now.
 880.141941 
Let's change this to switch case because I know that works.
 883.037950 
Even though there's only one option in this which case 
 886.681464 
I mean it's gonna work so I'm just going to use it 
 890.013029 
  906.027519  
as something else isn't working as the aliens aren't disappearing reappearing.
 912.864956 
Okay, we forgot to add a classless oops.
 920.337428 
And there we have it your very own space invader game.
 927.355773 
If you have any other questions about the game,
 931.867519 
please let me know below.
 932.854163 
And I'll try to get back to you.
 935.876294 
Thank you.
