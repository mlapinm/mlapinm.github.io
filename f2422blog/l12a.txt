welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial 5.277414  in this video we're going to be
looking at different shape object
properties 9.820544  we're going to be playing
with the group tool  12.252358 so we can group
objects together 14.095192  and control them all at
once 15.222698  we'll be looking at ways different
ways to select objects 18.704761  that might be
over top of another  20.276621 and then we'll be
looking at some with the different
levels that the objects appear on  

24.471655 so if
I hit the plus key I'll just zoom in a
little bit here 27.347777  I'll select the square
tool left click and drag 30.209840  to create a
nice square  31.194602 if you remember from our
last tutorial 33.236122 
Inkscape remembers what we did last time 35.289296 
so it has this border a certain color
that's stroked and then has this fill us
another color  40.322562 so I want to change this  43.265373 I
can right click go to fill and Stroke I
can change my stroke back to something
more like default that comes 49.892131  when you
first turning escape on will be one
millimeter for our stroke  52.788253 and then we'll
do our stroke color black 55.915237  and our filled
color will people yellow 57.981178  our alpha is up
almost all the way look it's 252 255 is
the highest 63.514988 so we'll put it back 255 or
our Pasties all the way  66.641269 up so now we
have a pure solid yellow rectangle
square 70.202289  and with a black border 72.371382  so now
I'm going to draw some other objects 74.388298  and
remember it'll keep in memory  76.424760 it will
remember the colors and the stroke
settings that I'm using  79.901994 so we'll draw a
couple things here this is probably good
for now  84.091246 yeah we'll just make a little 87.777436 
will make pac-man because he's fun  88.971064 and
then we'll change the color of some of
these I'll just do this swap with using
the bottom bar 93.029908  will change a few of
these colors 94.960225  now so I've drawn these
four different objects 98.443672  and the first one
we drew was the rectangle  or square  104.036302 and
so this one is going to be the lower
most level  106.446620 so if we drag it behind and
if we just move it around its behind all
these other objects  111.992651 the second thing we
drew is this  113.507096 so it's going to be behind
these 114.915418  but it's gonna be on top of this
one  116.759023 so what I'm showing is the order
that you draw things in is the order
they appear in the level on top of each
other 123.618298 
that's different than the layers 125.186506 
Inkscape does have layers and we'll be
playing with those later but right now
everything is drawn in the same layer 130.564896 
there's just different levels 131.954692 
they are on top of each other 134.191994  in the
order that you drew them in  136.383195 so if we
want to change the layer 138.068637  we want to
change this star to be a different way 139.943057 
on a different level I mean  141.816028 we can click
here we've done this in earlier videos 144.750155 
but we click this button up here raises 148.233103 
and lowers two different levels 149.514758  if we're
going to raise it all the way to the top 151.378001 
we just click raise to top  152.703171 all the way
to the bottom lower at the bottom 154.400994  and
then it'll be even below the very first
object we drew 157.793896  another way we can do
that is by using the page up and page
down key on the keyboard  162.776391 so I use that
quite a bit 164.966391  because sometimes you'll
draw something or for example 168.069837  and a good
key to learn is the duplicate 171.466164  so if you
hit ctrl d it'll duplicate the object 175.841651 
and I only have two squares one on top
of another  177.845506 but when you duplicate an
object it appears on the very top most
layer  181.673193 and so sometimes you'll duplicate
like for example if you're doing a
background  186.921583 we want a nice grey
background and we set this to the very
bottom 191.045642  but then if I want to duplicate
this background 192.837546  I can select it hit
control D on my keyboard  195.926526 then it covers
up everything 198.003283  so now I have two
backgrounds 199.634281  but one is the very top
layer  201.346163 ones that are a bottom layer  202.467070 so
I'm if I move this out of the way we can
see  205.116435 how that works 205.836049  so I'd the Delete key
 207.710494 that's a super important key to learn
make sure you memorize that one ctrl D
to duplicate 212.910857  I think you can do it also 214.184938 
I'm sure it's way you can do it 217.091446  some
other way 218.003600  but control D's right be able
to duplicate 221.851582  you can also do ctrl C so
you hit select my object hit ctrl C 226.283714  then
at any point you want you can hit
control V  229.681764 and it will paste that object 231.006208 
again so you get control V control V and
you can paste a whole bunch of different
at that same object 236.273079  I'll delete these by
selecting them hitting the Delete key 239.487727 
what else I'm gonna leave this
background and delete 242.721990  so you can work it
you can move multiple objects at once 246.560131 
maybe I want to move this star together
with this pac-man guy  250.356253 so I select the
pac-man and I hold down the shift key
and hit and click the star with my left
click as well 256.540131  and now those two will
move together  258.367410 and so they had their this
own selection 261.287024  they'll also scale
together 262.768203  they'll color together if I
click like
purple they'll both turn purple  267.440335 if I
click white double turn white 269.430629  so they'll
do whatever I whatever I applied to them 273.673713 
will happen to them together if I blur
they'll both blur together  276.454756 so anything
selected  277.930471 yeah if I want to add a third
item in there  well I can just hold down
shift and click a third item 283.921218  and now all
three of these are being selected
together 286.496865 
if I hit escape none of them are
selected I can click on the star 290.023486  and
move it I can move any one of them
separate  292.112806 but to select them all I can
hold down the shift key   and select as
many things as I want 296.257227  if I wanna select
everything I can do it that way another
way  298.433825 to do that is just to use your
selection window so left click  302.890356 and drag
and anything within this selection
window 306.880469  will become selected  307.877385 and if we
can control we can resize shape cover
all that stuff independently  313.710400 what else
okay so what if I want a group  317.169607 I'll
change this to a green  320.000241 you can group
objects so they stay they stay tied to
each other 324.364028  so if I want to tie 325.648155  maybe I
want to do like a  327.488925 let's make like a
snowman  329.513189 let's take this hit ctrl D to
duplicate this circle  332.417746 ctrl D again to
duplicate this circle  335.277928 I'll make the top
one kind of small make the middle one a
little bit smaller  339.386023 and yeah so now we
have like a nice little snowman   here 342.701056  and
I always want this object to move
together I don't wanna have to move
every part of it every time I move  349.255138 I
don't want to have to select by hitting
shift every time 352.161238  or by dragging them and
doing a window select 355.284525  so what I do is I
do select everything once  358.677519 and I go up to
object go down to group  361.345410 and click group
and now group everything together 363.714548  now
this behaves as if it's one object every
time no matter what circle I click on 368.177269 
it'll just select all three of them  370.903664 and
I can resize them shape them recover
them and they'll all do whatever I
whatever action I have them do  379.495069 if I want
to ungroup them I can just go to object
while it's selected and go to ungroup
and that'll ungroup these again and I
can control them individually  387.591893 also while
they're still grouped so the shortcut to
group is control G  391.291598 so let's select them
all and go control G a lot of times if
you download like a SVG file  396.768945 they'll be
grouped items  398.609421 and
the first time you open it up sometimes
everything is one big group the whole
image is one group  405.214796 and you can have
groups within groups too  407.778719 but it's
sometimes so what you can actually
change you can change something in the
group without having to ungroup it and
to do that you just double click 415.879081  and
then you can select a single object you
can select all these single objects
within the group  420.374592 and then when you hit
escape and click on it again  425.382914 oh it stays
as just the group 427.417154  so it's still grouped
together we didn't have to ungroup to
make that change 431.414433 
learning to use groups is important 434.475317 
you're going to use groups in Inkscape 435.819036 
groups are super important  437.295363 and this
group too it's gonna be if I lower it
down it's gonna lower the entire group 443.634297 
which is never think to so nothing
behaves independently  446.528719 when it's all
selected they all behave 449.114365  as one object  
basically 454.381462  yeah well what else was I
gonna say about groups 456.946337  that's probably
about it 457.781915  okay so if we hit the tab key
on our keyboard  460.689579 we can select the very
bottom most object  463.584273 so that happens to be
this one cuz I lower down to the bottom 466.878422 
while that selected if I hit the tab key
again  468.909443 it'll cycle through 470.564295  every object
starting from the lowermost  473.181075 to the
uppermost object  475.211960 so that's the way you
can find objects 476.924227  sometimes you'll have
an object like this pac-man 480.081438  maybe well
maybe we want to create like a nice
thing like this like a box with pac-man
on top of it 486.612391  but pac-man might be on the
bottom level 489.589624  so he's behind the box  491.704250 we
could move the box and then click and
raise it on top but to access an object
that's below  498.531234 what we can do is hold down
the Alt key 502.007379  and then click on that
object  503.336518 so the first time we click it
will select the foremost object the
second time we click  507.614023 it will select the
object behind  509.413819 and then we can see  510.341416 oh and
actually if we want to drag it if you
want to move it from that point  513.718037 we have
to hold keep holding the Alt key 516.252754  so
right now if I hold down alt and click
it'll select the pac-man  519.163479 and then while
still holding alt  520.873842 I left click and drag 521.934840 
and I can drag him out  523.370146 okay
that's amuse you probably practice 527.560327 
because a lot of times you will have an
object 529.465860  that's little be hidden behind
something  531.544069 and you'll want to be able to
click on
and you just for whatever reason you
won't be able to there'll be too much
stuff in the way  536.737561 and you won't be able
to click on it 538.333955 

 so just hold the alt and
you can toggle through clicking any item
that's behind there 542.615791  so I'm just holding
alt while keeping clicking 545.038490  and it's
selecting every object through the layer 547.526290 
for like I said if you don't have too
many to go through 549.869555  you can hit the
control key until you find the one you
want 552.220236  and then like the pac-man selected
right now I can tell because of the size
of the selection box  556.408489 and I can raise it
up by clicking the level up key  559.593410 or by
doing page up and page down   563.509260  yeah if
that's all I want to show you in this
video 567.833592  play with all that because this is
the base the basic building blocks  571.951143 the
basic tools you'll need to use 574.005700  when
making anything in Inkscape 575.771800  is just
learning how to control these objects 577.365088 
and move them around one with another 579.296177 
selecting them 580.593161  learning how to duplicate
it so we can duplicate this one  583.064997 if I
could control D right now 584.584589  it duplicates
this group  586.562027 and now it's still grouped  587.926108 so
we can really you can really start to
get crazy  591.082571 if I select all this stuff hit
ctrl G 593.905542  now I have another group here 595.468852 
then ctrl D and duplicate these a couple
times 600.195610  then all of a sudden we've got all
kinds of different objects 603.368603  different
groups  604.894340 and yeah if I want to contribute
and select a few of them we can move
these 608.919147  around resize them  611.719034 so play with it
just do what I just what I was doing
just there 614.497741  play with it get familiar
with it  615.883251 and then move on to the next
tutorial 617.523660  appreciate you watching
catching the next one 619.396040  619.396040  619.396040
