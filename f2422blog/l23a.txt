 1.496656 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial   5.622409  in this video we're going to be
looking at the filters 7.801869  that Inkscape has
to offer  9.563237 
there are many filters and they're
pretty powerful they can do some cool
things  13.556063 but you have to know how to use
them when to use them 16.525439  and so I'm just
going to introduce them to you I would
recommend that you draw something
similar to what I've done here 21.721561  so I just
drew a few rectangles from different
shapes 24.709656  and text a little gradient on
white  26.916170 I'm going to be left clicking and
selecting all of this 29.892267  and then applying
filters to it to kind of get an idea for
what the filters do 34.388247  so I'd recommend you
that you do the same thing go through
every single one of these filters  39.262573 and
learn what they do 41.124430  so first I'm going to
show you a couple that I like and we're
not gonna go through all of them by any
means 45.644144  but this one here ridged border is
pretty cool  48.915791 it gives a ridged border to
whatever object we have 53.276139  and so we can
see a nice little Ridge there it's kind
of creates a 3d shadow so maybe I don't
know this could be kind of cool for
something  61.844256 ctrl Z ctrl Z ctrl Z ctrl Z I
move that I forgot okay 67.220093  so now I'll go
back to before I applied that 69.552142  and I'll
show you some of these other ones 70.876142 
so under blurs I actually don't use
blurs because what I like to do with the
way I like to accomplish a blur 77.408194  is I'll
go to my fill and stroke 79.288492  and I'll just
use this blur here I'd rather do this
and apply like a filter blur  85.214633 so I like
to do all my blurs that way rather than
applying a filter  88.568278 when the filter is
applied I'll show you in this next part 91.504241 
it's actually the object still has its
properties 96.132948  

so if we go to bumps here 98.460571  and
we go bubbly bumps 100.868130 it kind of just
applies these bumps we can zoom in a
little bit 104.512616  and see if I hit the plus key 106.475881 
so we've got these bumps this texture in
and these were it was a straight line it
looks almost like it's clay or play-doh
or wax merging into each other 115.299401  but we
still have our separate box 117.799820  and we can
kind of move it around if I you do
control Z  122.172826 and if I double click very
quickly we can still apply a rounded
corner to this 126.431694  for example so you see
it's not a path it's still an object
like our circle  131.739795 we can still make it the
pac-man 134.411713 
even though it has this filter applied
which i think is pretty cool 137.343640  and then if
we want to change the settings of this 142.230409 
so this son looks pretty cool look at
that it's almost like a paint like a wet
paint 146.304321  if we go to these filters and go
down to filter editor 151.299956  we have these
options come up here  153.211710 so we have all
these options for this filter 155.708116  we can
actually change so if we go up here we
can change how it's applied so it's more
wet there 161.608073  and kind of inky towards the
outside  164.075939 we can go down and change
different settings 166.456042  for how this appears 168.130677 
so every time we apply a filter there's
gonna be options  171.331848 if we want to get rid
of this filter  173.306850 so we applied it to all
these objects together  175.607066 if we want to
take it off of just say the text 178.926583  we
select the text  180.452426 go the filter  181.336358 and go to
remove filter  182.772022 and then it's gone  183.948583 and if
we want to I can go do ctrl shift Z to
reapply that  188.771198 or wait how do you do redo 190.215217 
edit we go to  191.692076 let's not let me redo it 193.272092 
but I can go to filter and just reapply
that again  195.360057 we go to bumps we go to
bubbly bumps as I think so what we did 199.388018 
and then I just want to show that we can
actually edit this text here as well 204.344002  so
just because the filters applied doesn't
mean like in  208.773659 I guess I start bring that
out because in Photoshop sometimes or
when you apply a filter  213.851528 sometimes
if you don't do it correctly  215.711476 you can't
always go back and edit the object below
that's being filtered 221.363426 
alright so control Z a couple times
we're gonna go back before a lot of this
stuff was applied  227.767477 and let's hit the
minus key to zoom out a little bit  231.699517 and
I'll select all of these  233.103626 and show you
some other filters I could let myself
some notes  236.455540 so I'm gonna show you what I
want to there's a paper bump under this
one  240.455572 we can do paper bump 241.889015  so go to bumps
a paper was pretty cool  245.596900 so that applies
sort of like this looking texture 251.228954  I'll
undo that what else do we have here 254.724850 
thick paint and then distort chalk so we
must do filter bump 259.380320  we've got a thick
paint somewhere here 262.068642 
yeah so it creates that kind of look all
right 269.147698 
and then these are all kind of by
different size  so it's the bevels first 272.115952 
that's we created kind of like button
looking things 274.484068  we can apply this button
and create actual buttons like if you
want to do an user interface  278.584447 I there's a
better way to create buttons actually 280.716060 
we'll do in a future tutorial 282.265363  cuddlers
we're gonna skip let's go to distort
though this chalk and sponge is cool 286.982037  so
this one will want to change the
settings on it I think we have to do it
individually  291.737066 so we'll change this down
change this base frequency but it's it's
kind of creates the look of getting a
sponge  298.546258 and then dipping it in like
pressing it in chalk 301.970340  and changing things
that way  304.502238 oh I crashed it I had too many
too many things going at once 308.338970  so I'll
just draw for you 312.042310  what I really what I
really want to do is this that paper one
that looks pretty cool  315.786366 so if we just do
this like a white like that 318.058390  we'll just
look at it look at the rest of these
with just these two Oh 323.083026 
delete we'll get some text in here also
tj3  329.106248 okay zoom in here  331.410373 so now we'll take
all these  332.562359 and let's apply some other
filters  335.514310 here so we've got distort we
didn't we did that one  338.850370 we're gonna skip
a couple of our materials so we can
create like a 3d wood 343.850400  so that our white
especially is going to look like a kind
of a 3d wood  347.638135 and you see it's a little
bit graphics intensive 351.790887  and again you'll
want to keep in mind what your what
you're trying to do with these filters 356.630142 
or what with what you create so if
you're doing 3d wood for example and you
want to create a vinyl to put over top
of like glass on the back of your car 364.250730 
you can't print 3d wood on a vinyl
printer  367.258442 you have to keep more simple
shapes 368.902318  so depending on where you're
going to be displaying this artwork  372.634319 or
how you're going to be producing it  373.791614 you
may or may not want to apply extravagant
filters like these material ones  379.535584 we've
got like leopard skin  382.195443 or lizard skin 383.479440 
it's kind of a cool one here  384.947611 I mean I
really like this one 386.067989  look what the
effect that it does to this star thing 389.395655 
and it's really it's got this texture on
it so if we zoom in it's got this really
textured look which is pretty cool 395.559545 
let's zoom out what else and the makes
our text look pretty cool too 400.503772  that's
what that's control-z  402.719171 select everything 404.231690 
there's a few what I want to do overlays
is pretty cool so overlays if we go do
like cloud  412.075743 a cloud overlay get is sort
of a cloudy look 414.143612  control-z
there's another one that's kind of
cloudy looking on the overlays 419.883644 
there's called Scotland create some
cloud looks too  423.931634 so if you want to create
some clouds in the sky  426.059653 you can kind of
do this  427.631582 and then again we can come back
and individually change  430.980623 you know how
thick the clouds are or how they appear
on here  437.180955 I'll zoom out it control-z  439.956679 I
think what I'm doing I'm trying to zoom
out on my image why it keeps crashing 446.016710 
but I have my effects selected  448.996659 and so
what I'm actually hitting is the minus
key  451.556642 and it's just putting a number in
there that it just can't handle  454.912537 so I
apologize about that  457.021350  let's grab a few
these things keep setting this up 461.105066  I'll
just show you one more I think you're
getting the idea and keep crashing okay 465.614719 
Frost was cool though so let's just take
this will apply Frost to this one so we
go to filters overlays  472.546338 Frost is awesome 475.181867 
so if Frost just gives us a cool  476.366187 little
frosty looking background  478.506193 really cool I
think we probably wouldn't it we can
take the border off of this  482.382125 so I'll do a
shift no stroke and then we just have
this frosty looking background  489.202050 it should
be really cool for like a winter like a
wedding announcement  493.217953 or have it just be
the background of some announcement like
50% off sale or something like that 498.838869 


I think this frost one looks pretty
awesome 500.827106  alright one more and then we'll
be done with this video 507.079138  let's look at so
texture okay  510.127056 will do texture burst  512.255073 so we
go to texture 513.547775  filtered all the way down
to textures we go to burst  516.531119 so this one's
cool 518.219185  especially if you have other
objects next to it because then it's
this is kind of more that paint plate oh
look where it all mixes in  524.735221 and we can
change the color on this to because it's
an object 528.152293 
go ahead and change the color 529.935997  we can
even apply like a gradient into this 533.579673  and
just make it look pretty neat  536.968450 I think
there's a lot of things that you can do
with this  540.023786 but again it is it's gonna be
more intensive  543.523875 because it's doing a lot
of processing it's not pixel art 546.487817  it's
it's applying a filter to vector 549.704052  so it
can be a little more intensive  551.743835 but it
really just makes you think it makes me
think anyway there's a lot of different
ways  557.371906 there's more than one way that to
accomplish anything in Inkscape 561.124098  so you
can accomplish this look by in by plying
out many different filters  566.233138 and there's
just a lot of different ways to do
things  569.337350 so get familiar with these
filters  571.329394 and you can create some really
really cool things  574.205473 appreciate you
watching this video 575.701292 
catching the next one  577.151034 go ahead and
comment below and tell me how you like
to use filters  580.514869 I'm super curious to
learn  582.181499 you know different ways to apply
these  585.029324 and I'll catch you the next video 587.649237  587.649237  587.649237
