  1.447861 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial  5.456227 in this video we're going to be
using the Bezier tool 8.956776  so we learned in
the previous video about drawing with a
freehand tool  12.283622 we learned about
converting our objects into paths  19.003876 so we
go object to path  20.432944 and then we knew we
know we can change these individual
nodes  23.547646 so if you're a little bit hazy on
that or if you missed those videos you
might want to watch those first before
learning about the Bezier tool 29.528178  because
what the Bezier tool does is it draws
based on these different nodes 35.028344  and these
handles that control the arc or the
curve of a lion  40.788142 so I'm gonna zoom out
here  43.832418 we'll just delete these things real
quick and let's get started with our
Bezier tool 47.072513 
so the Bezier tool is here 48.660176  we'll click
on it  50.124094 if you've never used it before
you'll be in the default mode  52.732004 if you
have played with a little bit make sure
you're in the create regular Bezier path 56.732295 
and then we'll just click so we can
click a point here 60.656303  and then come over
click another point and hit enter 62.708702  and
we've created a line  65.211946 we can give it a
little thicker stroke by coming down
here  68.120349 and right-clicking 69.812317  and going to
will give it like 4 so it's sort of like
a fat line 72.868371  and we can change the color
of it by holding down the shift key 76.688381  and
clicking on any color 77.884264  so we'll make this
a purple line I guess 79.464269  and if we come
here click on this tool so we can edit
the different nodes of this path 85.104233  so what
the Bezier tool is done is just drawn a
path for us from point A to point B 90.645124  it's
just drawing a line based on the rules
that we've told it 94.300233  and all we told that
to do was do a straight line 96.512190  but we
could have it be a curved line  98.160430 and a
curve there's a couple different ways 100.701123  we
can come to the node  102.229179 if we left click
and drag 103.209038  it'll move the node around 104.753147  but
if we hold down the shift key  106.485296 and then
drag it'll bring out  108.897128 this little handle 111.085125 
and then this handle we can use too if
we move the angle of it  115.817245 if we rotate it
around it'll kind of change the
curvature of this arc coming out of this
node 121.897176  and if we change the distance of it
the further away it is the stronger that
art kind of goes  128.069326 so if we're not very
subtle we have it below 130.233330  if you want to
be like a check sign like a Nike sign or
something we have it come
here  134.429666 and then we do the same thing with
this when we go to this node hold down
the shift key and we can drag out this
thing and we can make sort of like a
wave  142.625318 where we want to make it a check we
make it really long here but just keep
it horizontal  146.941884 or we can rotate it down
and make like a nice curved arc shape 152.173221  so
that's kind of how we do that also if we
don't want it once these handles are out
we want to hold the shift key anymore  157.981274 we
can just play with the handle  159.573312 also we
can just click on the line at any point
we want click and hold 164.105237  and we can move
the line around that way 166.753381  at any point so
if we click up here 168.353337  it'll kind of move
just this point here 171.069113  if we click in the
middle here 173.209346  it'll move that point and
it'll move both of these handles
accordingly  177.897052 so that's kind of a good way
that I like to do is just by dragging
clicking the line 181.029043  but it's again we only
have two points 183.466243  one point here one point
here  185.097426 we can add another point by just
double clicking so if we double click
right now  188.929330 we've added another point 190.805575  and
now we have a third point here 192.181466  and it
also has these different handles these
things are tied together 197.029392  so we can
create like a little loop here 200.073220  we can
have it be straight we can create sort
like a sine wave if you want to move
this like right here  205.161336 we can have this
one be up and then have this will be
down  208.649107 and then kind of make that not so
extreme  213.385426 so that's one thing that we can
do just sort of playing around getting
used to this  219.177326 I'm gonna go ahead and
delete this 220.753472  we can also go back to our
Bezier tool  223.753910 and we can just left-click
and then for our second left click 227.237442  we
can left-click and hold  228.765237 and move our
mouse  230.629385 and we can create an arc that way 232.261173 
so now we can create these arcs as we go 235.429239 
now let's press the Enter key  237.833392 so now
we've created these arcs just as we were
drying without having to draw straight
lines  242.965458 and then Bend them individually  244.149234 we
can still go in and edit each of these
we can move the nodes around 247.525302  we can play
with these different handles and change
the angles of these arcs 251.801365  or we can just
click on any any one line  254.837429 and change the
arc for it 257.885234  all right do do also if we
just had a straight line let's go back
to our Bezier tool again 264.703122  let's create
another straight line and hit enter 266.693434  we
can just go
to our edit this tool to edit the notes 270.684220 
and we can click and just create an arc
that way without having to pull out
those handles 274.848367  every time 275.908111  I'm gonna
delete these  278.589267 so we click delete left
click delete Oh actually we can delete
them  283.685665 let me control Z as my show you can
delete individual nodes too 286.661406  so while
this is selected we double click we can
get into the node edit or we can click
on it here and then left click 292.430593  but we
can delete a node if I want delete this
last one  294.926437 I just click it 296.186546  hit the Delete
key  297.466592 and that node goes away 298.658560  we can
select multiple notes at the same time
by left clicking  301.862804 and do creating a
selection box  303.086430 let's click and drag 304.527074  now
we have these two nodes selected  306.534606 we can
move them together independent of the
rest of the path 310.114544  and we can hit the
Delete key and delete them   also 314.582602  so I'm
going to select all these nodes delete
all of them  317.356987 what I guess I can't delete
all of them  319.732924 yeah delete all but one but
if you want to leave the whole thing 323.032846  we
can just select it as like as yeah so
it's all together into the Delete key
and I'll delete that way 330.728674  let's go back
to our let's go back to draw  334.001317 so if we
want to draw a shape  335.305083 we don't have to
just draw a line  336.608907 we can actually draw a
shape 337.708718  we can complete  338.968826 so we can create a
little arc here create some straight
lines if we want to 342.337123  and then if we go
back to our starting node  344.569757 it'll
automatically complete our shape 347.261408  and
it'll fill it in without to press ENTER
to close it or anything it'll just
complete automatically  351.600911 and now we can
take this  354.456834 and we can edit the notes
again just like we did before 357.176588  but we can
come here select it and we can give it a
fill color  361.404926 so we can fill it with a
certain color 363.640579  and we can change the
stroke color too  365.804614 so we can make we can
give it a no fill color 367.524771  and if we hold
the shift key  369.288616 we can make the stroke a
different color so that's a blue kind of
hard to see we can make it a little
thicker  373.736501 so we can see it so 375.236584  we have a
nice blue outline there  378.096722 and if we one
thing that you might actually
accidentally do so if we go to our
Bezier tool 385.748639  and we just click here and
draw  387.140645 like sort of a line and hit enter
and close it off  389.984682 if you want to change
the color of this line  392.300662 naturally a lot
of times you'll just come down here 395.435852  and
want to select the color  so if we left
click red  397.872407 it's gonna actually do its
best to
to do what it thinks we're trying to
tell it to do 403.648394  which is give it a fill
color of red 405.808385  but we're trying to apply a
fill color to a line  409.530640 and not a shape not
a closed shape  411.943643 so it basically draws an
imaginary line from the last point to
the first point  416.506545 and then fills in
anything it possibly can  419.276467 so usually you
won't want to apply a fill color to a
line you always want to change the
stroke color  426.032281 so these paths that we draw
by default  429.328277 it's a it is a stroke 433.184526  so to
change the color we hold down shift 435.884985  and
then we can make it 437.322473  red will change the
thickness of it so we can just see it a
little more dramatically 442.290330  so that's how
you would do that 443.916371 
another option under the Bezier tool 448.199181  if
we just click them delete these 449.614814  I'll go
to selection 450.835071 
left click delete left click delete  453.064756 we
can go back to our bezzie a and up under
mode  457.414837 if we go to this one which is spiro 459.463062 
create spyro path  460.611282 let's click now if we
just click when I'm to click and drag we
just click a couple points  465.498967 and it
automatically creates this kind of cool
little  469.386945 we don't do a spiral necessarily
we can come out here 472.862916  so you can create
some needs kind of floral designs hit
enter 476.458955  and we've got this design here 478.710791 
which is pretty cool 479.795028  and we can get we
can go in and edit the different nodes
of this 485.107091  so every point where I clicked 486.005701 
we can edit these  487.277315 and I just creates a
much more fluid based off of some sort
of like fractal math or something 493.397527  and it
creates these nice spirals 495.129717  that we can
then edit  496.511294 and yeah change 500.566975  so this might
be nice 502.293778 
might be you might be able to think of
something  504.900812 that you can use this for 505.948978  and
it gets really nice 507.289104  when we start to
change the shape  508.632173 so we can also go
another setting under the busy a  512.164104 is this
shape 513.277099  so I'll go back to the regular
mode  514.857204 and under shape if we go like
triangle in  for example  518.726806 and if we just
create a nice simple line here  521.608946  we can
give it some character hit the enter key 524.253571 
and then you see that I'll kind of
create it fades off  526.833652 if we zoom in here
the last part is just sort of faded out 529.937569 
it's very thin 532.017779  and it's kind of more
thick over here 533.565604  we actually changed the
setting
this  535.703155 this is actually not super pretty 537.339406 
but if we go to path 538.452877  we go to path
effects  540.036885 we can change this to maybe this
one here  542.192759 will look too big but this
gives it more of like a dramatic look  546.236726 we
can also go back and doing this spyro
spyro  550.096781 if we check the spyro and go to
ellipse  553.820577 this creates kind of a nice
flourish  556.052546 so we can just do a couple
points here hit the enter key 558.930907  and then
we see it starts nice and thin here  561.568728 and
we can edit these nodes again  563.120746 however we
want to  564.412844 but it starts nice and thin 565.736547  and
then it goes and we can here we can
change the width of this particular one
with the ellipse 571.182883  so we can change and
make it kind of really thick 573.742401  and so you
can create some really nice flourishes
that way  575.726440 sometimes people will download
like clipart 578.864852  and they'll want to do you
know they'll find a specific flourish 582.025766 
but this way you can create your very
own  583.755389 we can change the colors of it 585.647567  and
you know make it pretty awesome  588.259182 that's a
couple cool things that you can do using
the Bezier tool  592.946579 go ahead and play with
it to get familiar with how it works 596.702834 
next video maybe we'll use the Bezier
tool to do some tracing 600.467119  or at least in
one of the future videos 601.663244  so stay tuned
for that go ahead 603.914794  and comment below ask
questions   get involved in the discussion 607.299667 
and we'll see you on the next video 608.903203  608.903203  608.903203
