 1.822660 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial  5.776382 in this video we're going to be
using the Bezier tool  8.870624 so we learned in
the previous video about drawing with a
freehand tool 12.246200  we learned about
converting our objects into paths  18.809095 so we
go object to path  20.533559 and then we knew we
know we can change these individual
nodes so if you're a little bit hazy on
that or if you missed those videos 26.227977  you
might want to watch those first before
learning about the Bezier tool 29.688563  because
what the Bezier tool does is it draws
based on these different nodes  34.848651 and these
handles that control the arc or the
curve of a lion 40.717273  so I'm gonna zoom out
here  43.498631 we'll just delete these things real
quick and let's get started with our
Bezier tool 46.850774 
so the Bezier tool is here  48.951696 we'll click
on it  49.857264 if you've never used it before
you'll be in the default mode 53.013402  if you
have played with a little bit make sure
you're in the create regular Bezier path 56.694682 
and then we'll just click  so we can
click a point here  60.627906 and then come over
click another point and hit enter 63.259930  and
we've created a line  64.939989 we can give it a
little thicker stroke by coming down
here and right-clicking  69.812047 and going to
will give it like 4 so it's sort of like
a fat line  72.907806 and we can change the color
of it by holding down the shift key 76.847866  and
clicking on any color so we'll make this
a purple line I guess  80.087748 and if we come
here click on this tool so we can edit
the different nodes of this path 84.739770  so what
the Bezier tool is done is just drawn a
path for us from point A to point B 90.570006  it's
just drawing a line based on the rules
that we've told it and all we told that
to do was do a straight line 96.347647  but we
could have it be a curved line and a
curve there's a couple different ways 100.763869  we
can come to the node if we left click
and drag it'll move the node around 104.579764  but
if we hold down the shift key and then
drag it'll bring out this little handle 111.075950 
and then this handle we can use too if
we move the angle of it 115.611921  if we rotate it
around it'll kind of change the
curvature of this arc coming out of this
node  121.969378 and if we change the distance of it
the further away it is the stronger that
art kind of goes  128.059893 so if we're not very
subtle we have it below 130.383787  if you want to
be like a check sign like a Nike sign or
something we have it come
here  135.283784 and then we do the same thing with
this when we go to this node  137.435453 hold down
the shift key  139.022556 and we can drag out this
thing and we can make sort of like a
wave where we want to make it a check we
make it really long here but just keep
it horizontal  147.010136 or we can rotate it down
and make like a nice curved arc shape  152.290506 so
that's kind of how we do that 154.402482  also if we
don't want it once these handles are out
we want to hold the shift key anymore we
can just play with the handle  159.251383 also we
can just click on the line at any point
we want  163.315867 click and hold and we can move
the line around that way at any point so
if we click up here  168.827360 it'll kind of move
just this point here  171.451150 if we click in the
middle here  173.131689 it'll move that point and
it'll move both of these handles
accordingly 177.216990  so that's kind of a good way
that I like to do is just by dragging
clicking the line 181.039544  but it's again we only
have two points one point here one point
here  184.959457 we can add another point by just
double clicking so if we double click
right now  188.991485 we've added another point and
now we have a third point here  192.235521 and it
also has these different handles these
things are tied together  196.987561 so we can
create like a little loop here 199.775333  we can
have it be straight we can create sort
like a sine wave if you want to move
this like right here  205.147423 we can have this
one be up and then have this will be
down  208.491440 and then kind of make that not so
extreme  213.183556 so that's one thing that we can
do just sort of playing around getting
used to this  219.127339 I'm gonna go ahead and
delete this  220.527667 we can also go back to our
Bezier tool  223.407659 and we can just left-click
and then for our second left click we
can left-click and hold and move our
mouse  230.503471 and we can create an arc that way 232.024500 
so now we can create these arcs as we go 235.131231 
now let's press the Enter key  237.703529 so now
we've created these arcs just as we were
drying without having to draw straight
lines and then Bend them individually  243.835417 we
can still go in and edit each of these
we can move the nodes around 247.839409  we can play
with these different handles and change
the angles of these arcs  251.615214 or we can just
click on any any one line  254.759366 and change the
arc for it  257.575567 all right do do also if we
just had a straight line  262.899746 let's go back
to our Bezier tool again 264.705347  let's create
another straight line and hit enter 266.625365  we
can just go
to our edit this tool to edit the notes 270.551466 
and we can click and just create an arc
that way without having to pull out
those handles every time  275.579891 I'm gonna
delete these  278.768011 so we click delete left
click delete Oh 281.835650  actually we can delete
them  283.352338 let me control Z as my show you can
delete individual nodes too 286.651827  so while
this is selected we double click we can
get into the node edit or we can click
on it here and then left click 292.715289  but we
can delete a node if I want delete this
last one  294.872450 I just click it hit the Delete
key  297.219731 and that node goes away  298.443704 we can
select multiple notes at the same time
by left clicking and do creating a
selection box  303.077687 let's click and drag  304.323796 now
we have these two nodes selected 306.236216  we can
move them together independent of the
rest of the path  309.798154 and we can hit the
Delete key 312.035775  and delete them 313.063698  also so I'm
going to select all these nodes delete
all of them 317.266501  what I guess I can't delete
all of them  320.254385 yeah delete all but one but
if you want to leave the whole thing 323.525473  we
can just select it as like as yeah so
it's all together into the Delete key 329.657576 
and I'll delete that way  

330.809357 let's go back
to our let's go back to draw so if we
want to draw a shape  335.380641 we don't have to
just draw a line  we can actually draw a
shape  we can complete  338.990675 so we can create a
little arc here create some straight
lines if we want to  342.738466 and then if we go
back to our starting node  344.542750 it'll
automatically complete our shape 347.354614  and
it'll fill it in without to press ENTER
to close it or anything it'll just
complete automatically  351.406572 and now we can
take this  354.306534 and we can edit the notes
again just like we did before 357.204145  but we can
come here select it and we can give it a
fill color  361.084623 so we can fill it with a
certain color 363.268288  and we can change the
stroke color too  365.604712 so we can make we can
give it a no fill color  367.484417 and if we hold
the shift key we can make the stroke a
different color  so that's a blue kind of
hard to see we can make it a little
thicker so we can see it 374.980767  so we have a
nice blue outline there  377.677085 and if we one
thing that you might actually
accidentally do so if we go to our
Bezier tool  385.541061 and we just click here and
draw like sort of a line and hit enter
and close it off 389.865343  if you want to change
the color of this line naturally a lot
of times you'll just come down here and
want to select the color so if we left
click red  397.941681 it's gonna actually do its
best to
to do what it thinks we're trying to
tell it to do which is give it a fill
color of red  406.052953 but we're trying to apply a
fill color to a line and not a shape not
a closed shape  411.836896 so it basically draws an
imaginary line from the last point to
the first point  416.492868 and then fills in
anything it possibly can  419.176938 so usually you
won't want to apply a fill color to a
line you always want to change the
stroke color  426.068972 so these paths that we draw
by default  429.400455 it's a it is a stroke so to
change the color we hold down shift 435.824415  and
then we can make it red  438.344455 will change the
thickness of it so we can just see it a
little more dramatically 442.756461  so that's how
you would do that 443.808736 
another option under the Bezier tool 448.196294  if
we just click them delete these I'll go
to selection 450.844577 
left click delete left click delete 452.884472  we
can go back to our bezzie a and up under
mode 457.345443  if we go to this one which is spiro
create spyro path 460.716448  let's click now if we
just click when I'm to click and drag we
just click a couple points 465.444587  and it
automatically creates this kind of cool
little we don't do a spiral necessarily
we can come out here  473.140454 so you can create
some needs kind of floral designs hit
enter  476.600474 and we've got this design here 478.577078 
which is pretty cool  480.076510 and we can get we
can go in and edit the different nodes
of this so every point where I clicked 485.960448 
we can edit these  487.640380 and I just creates a
much more fluid based off of some sort
of like fractal math or something 493.932505  and it
creates these nice spirals  495.472595 that we can
then edit  496.756558 and yeah change so this might
be nice 502.012508 
might be you might be able to think of
something that you can use this for 506.212453  and
it gets really nice when we start to
change the shape so we can also go
another setting under the busy a is this
shape 513.028200  so I'll go back to the regular
mode  514.719917 and under shape if we go like
triangle in for example 518.603819  and if we just
create a nice simple line here 521.772556  we can
give it some character hit the enter key 524.407861 
and then you see that I'll kind of
create it fades off if we zoom in here
the last part is just sort of faded out 530.240181 
it's very thin and it's kind of more
thick over here  533.903933 we actually changed the
setting
this  535.284072 this is actually not super pretty 537.248220 
but if we go to path we go to path
effects  539.932492 we can change this to maybe this
one here 542.380023  will look too big but this
gives it more of like a dramatic look  546.331936 we
can also go back and doing this spyro
spyro if we check the spyro and go to
ellipse  553.912137 this creates kind of a nice
flourish so we can just do a couple
points here hit the enter key 559.187311  and then
we see it starts nice and thin here  561.283731 and
we can edit these nodes again however we
want to 564.175812  but it starts nice and thin and
then it goes and we can here we can
change the width of this particular one
with the ellipse  571.344408 so we can change and
make it kind of really thick and so you
can create some really nice flourishes
that way sometimes people will download
like clipart  579.011808 and they'll want to do you
know they'll find a specific flourish
but this way you can create your very
own  583.895922 we can change the colors of it and
you know make it pretty awesome  588.279880 that's a
couple cool things that you can do using
the Bezier tool 593.031683  go ahead and play with
it to get familiar with how it works 596.963826 
next video maybe we'll use the Bezier
tool to do some tracing  600.303393 or at least in
one of the future videos 601.455707  so stay tuned
for that go ahead and comment below ask
questions  605.955652 get involved in the discussion 607.203616 
and we'll see you on the next video 608.891746  608.891746  608.891746
