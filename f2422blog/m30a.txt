 1.415416 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial 4.919765  in this video we're going to be
using Inkscape to do some more mapping 8.792275 
but this time we're not going to
actually get a vector map like we did in
the last video 12.500614  instead we're just gonna
grab some satellite imagery 16.868613  and
basically create something like this so
this is an example of one I've done I
just did like a screenshot and got this
imagery of this property  25.621117 and then I did
some you know puts a little tree line 28.587994  I
drew like some green circles here to
show trees  31.723496 I actually did some measuring
and so I know exactly like if I were to
build a 50 by 100 foot shop  37.521359 what the
footprint would look like on this
property  39.868140 so this is actually a 50 acre
property   that I have here in Idaho  44.104875 and
this is sort of a mock-up of what I
wanted to look like so I wanted this is
a future building site for a house in
yellow 51.337091  and all of these are just
separate objects 53.733361  and so they're just
drawn right on top of the actual image
satellite image   that I got from Google
in this case 62.579345  and so these are like some
different areas for animals to be this
is an existing house right here 70.582877  and this
is like an addition that I want to put
on to it and a little lean-to over here
or maybe you plant a tree here 75.922266  so it
just gives you a good idea these are
gonna be like some garden grow beds like
raised gardening beds  83.108887 this is my go-kart
race track like I said it's 50 acres has
a pond over here  90.233374 and some different
ponds that I'm gonna add in the future
and some nice treed area  95.038632 but so this
just helps me see exactly what I want to
do  97.870305 and then I actually have these
different things too like I have a 1
acre and this is how large 1 acre is so
if I could kind of overlay it and its
shaded a little bit 107.490474  so I could see how
much one acre like my I could see my
solar my solar array over here is gonna
be 116.525879  you know it'll be about a quarter or
a third acre maybe  121.274229 it's how much it will
take up  123.717776 I have a six acre pasture here
and I can I could change the color of
this to read or two green it just sort
of shades over and I can see still what
it will
you know I can see sort of the contour
of the the land underneath 138.326722  it if I want
to change like the pond like this  140.844811 I can
come over here and change the the size
of the pond and have it be a little bit
different  145.401408 so just really really cool
tools  148.015203 you know a lot of times people
think if this would be great for a
landscaping  152.103608 if you're like Ana landscape
architect  153.628495 or it's just good for it for
construction or for visualizing the use
of an area  160.244184 so in this one like I said
it's different than the last video we
did because it's not actually where we
can't actually edit like these existing
trees  169.216675 it's just an image  170.832174 so I'll show
you how to do this  172.412241 there's another
property that in Idaho that's very rural
here in Rockland Idaho middle of nowhere 180.779282 
so we're gonna zoom in here and I'll
show you how to grab this footage or
this footage know how to grab the the
actual image  186.392369 I'm getting this one from
open map tiles comm  189.271820 which is a much more
open I'm not quite sure I don't think
the satellite image you can actually use 194.192179 
I'm not sure I was reading on that but
they actually do offer free and open map
tiles 200.352265  that you can actually download and
you can host your own Maps 204.616252  privately and
just use them for whatever you want  207.080314 okay
here we go right here's the property I'm
looking at  211.255229 so this is a teeny tiny
little off-grid house that I'm also
working on  216.987896 and it's on 35 acres 218.230780 
this is ooh - see if we can get some
clarity on it  221.451138 looks like that's about as
clear as it's gonna give us
unfortunately  225.411762 so I'll zoom out a little
bit here  227.067548 but the property goes in fact
maybe I want to draw the property line 232.746366 
so what I'll do I'll just copy this part
of the image to do that there's some
browser plugins you can install that you
can actually make an area selection   and
just select it 241.405541  but I'm gonna do the
Print Screen key  243.490454 so I'll just hit print
screen on Windows that'll save it to
your clipboard  248.169271 so you could open up a
program like or even like Microsoft
Paint  252.172966 and then you can right-click and
go paste 254.510334  in  fact we might be able to
even do that here if we right-click and
go paste  let's see 259.329919  no I don't think it
put it into our clipboard because I'm on
Linux here  262.795072 and so what I need to do
let's just go file new 264.915693 
and I'm actually going to it's for this
I'll find where that got saved to it I
think is my home directory  274.522560 it's this one
right here  276.775456 perfect so now we've got this
imagery I'll make this fullscreen 282.195049  and so
I actually have two monitors  283.615252 but this is
the one  285.467459 and I could bring it into to
and crop it 288.774363  but for now I can just
leave it just like this 290.588860  and now I can
actually come over and draw over top of
the building  294.147347 and make different notes on
here  298.319380 what is going on right click 300.687425  let's
go to fill and Stroke for my stroke size
down to something more manageable 305.766969  and
bring up opacity to 100% okay 311.771748  we've got
some very wacky colors going on here 318.943478 
let's just get rid of the stroke all
together by holding shift and clicking
on this X in the bottom left hand corner 326.075780 
and now we can that  328.014231 this is like really
really poor image also 330.239147  you can do the
same thing with a drone with drone
footage  333.019234 so you can download your own
drone footage  336.223632 and do it that way so
maybe I'll draw the house and I'll mark
it in red  340.459058 and then if I want to do the
border the property I can get the Bezier
curve tool 344.967454  and I just know this is
actually where my property line goes 348.895495  so
I'm gonna click it goes just about like
this this is the 35 acres  356.270163 does it I
don't know it goes up   here yeah it does
oops  362.481511 it goes about to this little canyon
over here 366.977074 
now I might not go that far now close
this off and it creates a black line  375.076520 and
then I can click a Cutler so I'll do
maybe   we'll do a 379.356409  let's do a blue  381.665502 and
then this one I can come over here to
our pasady under fill and Stroke 384.573620  and
turn it down up I have the image
selected right now 387.017735  I'll make sure that
the object is selected selected 390.117554  oh
that's a blend mode that's the opacity
of the image let's do this  396.677617 alright so
then I can just kind of see like that
now if I double click in here I can come
it in and round out some of these and
fix this one that I didn't want to have
like that  407.585638 yeah so there you go so I can
show someone this now 414.029662  I hold alt I can
access and click that 416.965551  let's raise this
to the top maybe was make it yellow 419.877172  and
so I could I could show this I could
send this part of the map to someone now
and say this is the the land  425.134442 and I could
put a note in here 427.363013  that says 35 acres
will turn it white  433.326748 so you can see it's
probably a really good tool for Realtors 436.750927 
or contractors or anyone that needs to
make notes on on top of existing imagery 443.198833 
it's a really really good way to go 444.798743  and
I could draw like an arrow  447.314698 you can do
arrows actually to let me show you that
so if we did this curve tool again we
just oops get the wrong tool 455.981979  if I go
like this and like this hit enter it's
just a black line  462.579040 and then we go into
fill and stroke and we can change it
over here so it has all inside of it
there it's the ending so the marker put
an arrow on the other end 474.878208  so this will
have an arrow right on the end of it and
now we have a nice arrow pointing here
and we can hold down shift and make the
whole thing white  483.886518 if we double click we
can change the length of it 488.710736  so now I
have an arrow here pointing to the house
and I can say something about it as well 493.835260 
so I can just ctrl D duplicate this text 498.215173 
change the size of it a little bit 500.313416 
and I'll say something like 1200 square
foot house all right  514.527228 there you go
so I've successfully created some nice
information about this and if I wanted
to do we could do like a future location
of something like a pond or you know
future location of something 532.639991  but yeah
just a really great way that you can
quickly get in and add a vector layer
over top of an existing raster image
like this  542.447868 and then to export this what I
would do is sometimes I'll just come
over here and actually drop just a box
over the part I want to export 551.419503  and then
I turn down the opacity all the way down 556.449861 
and then I just go to file export PNG
image  560.582361 and I just export the selection I
make sure selection this is clicked
right here  565.042450 and then I just go we'll go
export as we'll send it to pictures 569.969402  and
we'll call it drop info dot PNG hit save 577.186026 
and now we hit the export button that
did that yeah and I could change the
size if I wanted to of that  583.921851 and now we
can come out a full screen here and we
can go and see what that looks like 588.801862 
right here so here's our property info
that we just did so this is just a
picture and it only show it's just this
part 599.073417  so we can email this to someone
it's not a very large file at all 601.489355  we
could upload it to the web 603.524274  and we have a
nice map layer over top 607.409977  this is
something you can also do pretty
reasonably using 611.677950  okay which is a
free author into Photoshop  614.225494 so hopefully
you found this video informative 616.034003  go
ahead and like comment subscribe let me
know if you have any questions 620.961672  and I'll
catch you in the next video 622.913861  622.913861  622.913861
