 1.407033 hey guys in this video I'll teach you
how to draw this watermelon in vector
art using Inkscape  8.304363 this is an
intermediate level tutorial and so
you'll want to know the basics we're
gonna go through fairly quickly 13.504132  this
artwork has been created by UK art
design I've partnered with them to
create the artwork and the video and
I'll be doing the voiceover so we're
gonna try to test this out and see how
it works if you like this video 24.387684  we'll
make more in the future 25.788182  you can download
the source file at Wikimedia Commons 28.918516 
I'll include the link in the description
if you want to check it out  32.236887 let's hop
over to the screencast though 33.957452  first
we're gonna select the circle tool 36.201032  and
we'll draw a circle 38.233049  and then since we
don't want to be completely circular
we'll go path object to path because we
want to change the shape slightly to
make it more realistic looking  45.849186 so we'll
make it a little bit 'officer not quite
so circular  49.365104 we'll change the color to
green and  51.277090 then we'll go ahead and grab
this Bezier curve tool  54.285055 and we'll use
this to just sort of left-click and
create these nodes 58.112705  we're going to draw
sort of the lines the black lines that
you see are the dark green lines that
you see in watermelon 65.486087  here's like a
reference of what it'll look like 67.268553 
so we'll speed up the video here and
just show drawing all of these 70.752890  it's
really just a path an outline drawn path 73.408828 
when they're all drawn we'll hold down
the shift key and left-click to select
each of them  77.772543 and go to path Union this
creates a unified path we can then right
click and go to duplicate  83.657537 and so
selecting both the circle  85.668963 and the new
path go to path intersection 88.036606  and that'll
clip off the tops and bottoms  90.068869 so that
our lines are just within the circle 92.120890  we
go to stroke and turn off the stroke but
then we turn on the fill  95.757324 and then we'll
change the color to this darker green so
that it shows up  99.292970 we're gonna repeat
these steps again with the Bezier curve
tool  102.819936 so this time we're creating the
outline a little bit lighter green color
around these darker green lines  108.483675 if you
feel like this is going too fast you can
change the video playback speed of this
video on YouTube in the bottom right
hand corner  115.472022 but I really want to get
this material I don't really want to
drag this out too long 119.999863  we're holding
down shift to select all of these again
we go to path Union these are the same
steps we did to create the original ones 127.248540 
we duplicate it and then selecting both
the circle  129.207797 and the new path that go to
path intersection 131.827557  then we turn off the
stroke 134.013405 
we turn on the fill and again it's over
top now so we adjust the color to be
able to see this and this time we have
to lower it down one level 141.471565  so that we
can see through what we did before with
that darker line  145.367607 we'll copy the color
and we'll add a gradient here  149.979675 so we
select the gradient tool from the
toolbar 153.007710  and we can move that gradient if
we click the center  155.383373 or adjusting the
center color and the position of it by
clicking the arm 159.515565  we're adjusting the
color that it fades to and also the
length of the gradient goes out right
now 164.551323  it's fading to white or transparency 166.952744 
we can adjust this color to fade to a
darker green and 170.735925  then we can move the
gradient around to where it looks good
kind of gives it that lighting effect
like it's a little bit more light in the
middle and then darker around the edges 178.123544 
from here we duplicate the circle 185.491834  and
we'll move the circle down just a little
bit and go to path difference this will
just create a little sliver 193.596128  and this
sliver we can adjust the opacity to give
it sort of a glassy outlined look around
the edge  200.255510 do the same thing again 202.243666 
so we duplicate move it to the point we
want 205.399549  and then have one both are selected
we we are creating the difference to
create sort of a Halfmoon shape  211.707283 this
time we'll add a black color and a
gradient to create more of a shadow in
the bottom right hand side  216.899292  
process one more time 223.143305  to create another
sort of Halfmoon shape 226.624405  so we'll bring
the circle up about this high and then
select in the original circle 230.075372  and the
intersection of there creates this moon
shape  233.107343 and we'll adjust that again with a
black color with a gradient turn the
opacity down  237.538989 and we'll add a gradient in
here 242.479160 
now we'll add a circle  250.491225 and we're going
to turn it white we're going to go to
path object to path to make sure that we
can change the shape of this if we want
to  256.655797 and then we'll add it up here to the
very top left of the watermelon 259.295363  and then
clicking the Edit path by a node is
where how we can get into these nodes
and adjust the shape beyond just any
lips 265.751393  so we can come in here and
fine-tune it we can use these handles to
adjust the angle that the lines come out
of each node 271.983291  it looks it's a very hard
white right now but we can adjust the
opacity  276.159105 and we can also apply a gradient
which is what we're going to do 279.155200  so we
grab the gradient tool and this time we
can just draw a linear gradient right on
here  289.447854 and we can move it around go to
where we want turn down the opacity  293.023299 and
now we have a nice glassy looking well
lit watermelon 298.023993  if we left click and drag
and select everything  301.154831 we can go to
object group and group everything
together then  305.399369 when we move the
watermelon it all moves together  308.079206 now for
the next part we're going to draw the
half sliced watermelon 312.808314  so we'll get a
size reference  315.795932 we'll draw a circle and
then this rectangle 317.917134  we'll lay it over
top so let both go to path difference 321.123570 
and that cuts this in half I'm not going
to be doing that the pausing and
highlighting for the second portion
because it's all the same tools  327.435480 but
again you can pause the video or you can
watch slower 330.668683  we go path difference with
these two so we create a sort of a slice
in there we'll change the color to red
duplicate again by right-clicking and
going to duplicate  338.771828 you can also use a
shortcut ctrl D on your keyboard to do
the duplication  343.499595 and then path difference
and we do this a couple times here to
create sort of this layered effect   where
we have a different color layer of half
circle going up 353.243539  we'll add a gradient in
here from a darker red to a lighter red 356.911673 
and keep bringing this up 359.695588  just to give
us some more depth some more perspective
and some different lighting 363.744003  so we have
like this darker red towards the rind
and then we have more of the light red
as it goes to the center 370.091860 
and for this part we're going to we're
going to draw those darker lines that we
did on the whole watermelon 379.367855  so we just
draw these we create the path  382.373773 and then
we need to go path intersection with the
intersection of the green half circle  388.561677 we
can use the eye drop cover to pick the
same color that we used last time 392.932199  so we
get it exactly the same  394.904272 and then we'll
repeat the same process for that that
sort of outline this time we're looking
at a cross-section but it's the same
colors and the same tools we're using  403.004526 so
we'll grab this again and then we can
change the color with the eyedropper
tool and now we're have this exact same
colors of greens   that we were using in
our original one  412.228242 we'll create some
circles here with some white with
opacity to kind of create a nice
lighting effect against this red  422.080359 apply a
little bit of a gradient to that as well 425.072318 
this is going to be the seed so we draw
a circle  428.296226 and then or any lips we'll go
to path object to path so that we can
change this to be more of a seed shape 434.072979 
so we'll adjust that slightly  436.068242 and then
we can draw a little highlight here so
we'll draw this sort of a Halfmoon shape
this is just drawn with a Bezier curve
tool 441.966675  we add white we add a little bit of
a gradient 444.851420  and then we can duplicate
these seeds and place them around the
watermelon  449.238420 so again we can use ctrl D to
duplicate  452.726873 we can add all these together
and create a group  454.967673 and then we can
rotate them around we can flip and
rotate 459.979803 
resize the inner ones to be a little bit
smaller   than the outer ones 465.888349 
we think we have that good we can select
the whole thing go to object group and
now we have a nice sliced watermelon
that we can move around as one group
will place it right up here next to the
watermelon  478.773231 and from here we just need to
create a little bit more depth a little
bit more lighting  482.279246 so we'll use the
Bezier curve tool to create a black
object here  485.934988 that will reduce the opacity
and have it be some shading 489.174966  and then
we'll place it behind the watermelon to
give it sort of that layered effect 493.323166  we
will create a black circle with a radial
gradient  497.479903 and we'll place two of these
one each under the watermelon and this
is a great little trick for just
creating a nice shadow effect like
there's a light shining from the top 506.279226 
then you have that shadow underneath
really simple to do and really adds a
lot of depth to the image will create a
black square  513.595280 and then we'll turn this
into a radiant as well but we'll have it
kind of gradient to a darker gray with a
lighter gray in the middle just to give
it sort of a nice backdrop to give it
some contrast against the background 524.839139 
here we'll select both watermelons  527.963143 and
we'll flip this down this is going to be
the reflection 531.703086  so as we flip it we need
to adjust the bottom one a little bit up
so that we can have an accurate looking
reflection 537.435136  we adjust the shadows a
little bit and the lighting a little bit 540.243830 
to make it look natural 542.359969  notice not all
of it will group it we got an object
clip  545.499671 and we can clip this so that it's
not not going off the bottom of the
background there  551.620162 and then we can lower
down the opacity to make it look more
natural  556.485516 adjust the shadows a little bit
under the watermelon  558.871793 and there you have
it that's the final image I hope you
guys enjoyed that I feel like I talked
very very fast let me know your feedback
what you think about this video if we
should do more like this  567.699831 as always
thanks for watching  569.418358 and I look forward
to catching you in the next video 571.914352  573.808605  573.808605
