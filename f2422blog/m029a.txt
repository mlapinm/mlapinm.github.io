 1.680200 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial  5.176492 in this video I'm going to show
you how to download map data from Open
Street Map in a SVG format 12.452940  so that you
can edit it in Inkscape  14.668475 and make your
own custom maps for whatever you want to
do  17.942726 so Open Street Map if you don't know
it's a free alternative to like Google
Maps or Bing Maps it's basically a free
and open map  25.226056 can like the same idea as
wicked of Wikipedia so people just
contribute all this map data 30.605611  it's the
entire world that's very very granular
especially on larger cities 34.777309  you can zoom
in and find individual businesses 36.934365  and
different things that are happening at
certain parts of the world  40.597468 so we can
just search up here and I was going to
do maybe like a Hawaii picture 44.897579  so we can
zoom in here to Hawaii and if we want if
there's a certain thing we want to get 49.811188  I
will say we're gonna want to zoom in and
get some pretty good detail if I'd to do
just all of Hawaii like this 55.812125  and it was
about like thirty three megabytes so
it's quite large for a for a vector file 61.241136 
and it's it's just a little bit slow to
work with especially if you have an
older or slower computer 66.175939  but if you're
zooming in on a certain area let's say
you have a business here in Hawaii 70.122787  and
you want to create a nice like a map of
the downtown area and show your
customers how to get 76.462371  maybe you have like
an Airbnb or something  78.025688 and you want to
show how to get from the airport to your
Airbnb   where's the airport  82.661717 it's like
north you okay oh it's right here
actually alright  87.161148 so we have the airport
and you want to figure out how to get to
the airport down to your Airbnb over
here  91.216964 so what we need to do is just share
it's called share over here on the right
hand side 96.461504  we click on share and we can
either you the easy way is just create
the short link and you can go include
marker 103.729346  and you can just drag this marker
to wherever your Airbnb is 107.224702  then you can
just copy this link and you could
actually just send them this link and
they can come right to OpenStreetMap and
find it 112.990746  but if you want to get a little
bit more  115.633521 you want to customize a little
bit the colors 117.361549  and sort of what your the
information you're giving them 119.734234  you can
select this format go to SVG  123.336897 and we can
go to set custom dimension and that'll
be we can choose this like what what
parts do we want to actually get out  131.316321 so
maybe we just want just this
part of the map right here 135.305447  and then we
just click download 137.208446  we can change the
scale too  138.475168 I like to always hide so just
go one and hit enter 142.799380  depending on the
objects you have selected there'll be a
lower limit that you can have selected 146.699254 
but I'm gonna lower this down the higher
this number the larger your file size
will be but there is a minimum floor so
the minimum on this one is forty seven
thousand five hundred 154.855496  I'll click
download 157.394973  and what OpenStreetMap now does
is convert this map data into an SVG
file  162.378941 that I can download it shouldn't
take too long up and downloaded a couple
other ones  166.149168 so this one looks like it is
done downloading it's called map three 170.876852 
because I deleted my last map three  172.888999 so I
can look at this under my downloads
folder and find it  176.345935 and I can right click
and go to open with other application
and open it in Inkscape 180.916948  I could also
just open up Inkscape 183.352296  and then and then
navigate to where it is and open up from
within Inkscape that way  187.456913 and oops let me
fullscreen this here 192.868872  oh did I get the
wrong I know this is the right one 194.908756  so
what it's actually showing me the part I
have selected  197.592706 we can zoom in here and
see  199.752851 but it's actually exported out the
whole island too which is nice  203.053004 just it
just didn't get a lot of the 205.360801  the details
extra it's not the whole island it looks
like  208.125002 but it it exported the actual
details of the part I told it to 212.847601  so we
can see the airport here  214.350711 and and we can
follow down the freeway or interstate or
interstate and that's how I have
interstates  223.575364 and then we come down here
and find out so maybe one of these
buildings is the exact air B&B  229.298391 okay so
we'll select like maybe it's this one
right here so what we do if we just
double click in here 235.066476  it lets us select a
building we can turn it like red 238.354872  and we
can draw we could we can come over here
and just draw like with our mouse   and be
like this is the location 247.026785  and then we
can write some notes here 248.790799  so if we click
text  250.827079 Oh letting me do text  253.191674 so this file
was 8 megabytes so it's not too bad it's
still still pretty manageable  258.007571 but it
looks like it's taking a little bit of
time rendering  260.467803 probably because I'm
doing a screen recording at the same
time 263.960269 
and this text tool is just like  267.163588 it's not
liking it 268.260135 
okay I've reloaded this in here I was
having an issue with the text tool 271.098247 
and one thing I will say is if we go to
look at layers everything's on one layer
right now so it's not managed incredibly
well  278.121650 just the the format they give us
just raw vector data 281.352827  which means if we
click to change the text 283.583581  we have to
delete one letter at a time 286.056233  and also if
we zoom in here behind the letters it
has like sort of a little can you see
this has like a little glow or a little
outline of the letters behind it 295.707874  so that
can be kind of annoying  297.599547 and there are
some more advanced options for exporting
the map data 301.496167  and converting it to vector
yourself  and then you can choose what
layers you can just export it without
any text at all   which which is kind of a
nice option  309.462795 or if you zoom out further
actually an export 311.958955  so maybe play with
that a little bit 314.412421  but hopefully this
gives you an idea for what you can do so
you have all this this data that you
have here  318.324487 and we can actually select and
make changes to it we can change the
outline of it  323.434023   if we double click we can
actually change the outline of the
footprint of the building all these
little places down here 330.326942  we can change
the color of them 331.962714  and we can move them
around  333.958497 we could scale if we wanted to
like make it more dramatic we can scale
this up if I lock this  339.486768 so we can kind of
scale it up just to kind of show people
like you are here  343.976341 or something give them
an idea and we can circle it with like
maybe grab a red here  348.969505 and so then you
can you know you could show people this
is just an example if you wanted them to
come from here and you could even draw 355.670424 
what could you do a couple different
things  357.642211 one way you could do it is just
like this 359.838285  so you draw like a little
curve here 361.641523  and you're like this is the
route you need to take to get to our
place and you kind of figure out exactly
how it is 367.281501  and then we come over here to
fill and Stroke  371.509803 so we change the stroke
size of this way 373.872097  way way up to something
like thirty because of the size of this 377.541781 
and then we turn that red as well 379.479388  so you
could be like hey guys if you're coming
to visit my place this is the route you
take  384.641952 we can turn it yellow maybe
something just kind of really stands out 387.154038 
and then you can add notes in here I was
trying to last time adding text when it
kind of got glitchy 392.531623  but again we
wouldn't we wouldn't need to export all
this stuff 395.623884 
but hopefully that gives you an idea for
how you can edit a map  400.318206 and get this data
and then of course we just go to file
export PNG image 404.734054  and we can export this 406.443631 
and then once it's in once it's an
actual image  408.756523 we just export it like this 410.390223 
oh this is gonna be quite large  412.396998 just
gonna be incredibly large hi hey  413.876884 I did
it 600 dpi because that's what I was
doing for print design in the last
tutorial  418.244751 let's change it to 90 and then
go export and I'll be much faster  421.998306 and so
now I'm at a full screen 424.759439  so now if we go
to the downloads here  428.136727 we can look at
just this image downloads 432.254417  and we can see
it just in like an image format  435.904593 so we
have nice image that we could email to
someone and be like hey here you go I
just left it a different I selected the
area of the love this yellow outline to
do that  447.172802 but then you can always crop
this image  448.828967 or put it in and so you give
them an actual image file but you use
the SVG to kind of make it 455.210925  you know
whatever you want to do  457.687570 anyway that is
using Open Street Map  462.111073 to generate SVG
files if you can then edit and customize
yourself  467.357639 I will throw in a note here as
well you can use Open Street Map to do
your own mapping so if you want to add
if your area like Hawaii is probably
pretty well mapped 475.975060  but where I live in
Idaho 477.873402 
I've though there's actually not a whole
lot of mapping done  484.110939 and so there's areas
or just like completely blank like this 487.179633 
for the most part  488.538715 and you can actually
contribute yourself so you can actually
come in here a sign up for an account
and you can edit the map yourself and
you can draw I've done quite a bit of
mapping actually if you draw outlines 499.560950 
and fix errors and roads and label
businesses so it's really cool just
community driven data  506.121051 so I encourage you
to use Open Street Map when you can as
an alternative to something like Google
Maps  510.792825 but also go ahead and get in there
and add data 513.808619  so that it can be used by
other people in the world 518.929195  thanks for
watching hopefully you found this
informative 520.721366  go ahead and leave questions
and comments below  522.348706 if you have any and
I'll catch you in the next video 525.908589  525.908589  525.908589
