 1.511946 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial 5.515867  in this video we're going to be
looking at the text tool within Inkscape 9.504572 
so text tools over here on the left hand
side 11.237887  we just click this letter a and
that lets us click anywhere on to create
a point where we can start typing text 17.755243 
but before I click I'm just going to hit
the plus key  19.893313 and we'll zoom in here on
our page scroll to the top  23.324709 and I'll
click right up here in the top left-hand
area 26.912843  and we see a cursor appears  29.129677 and we
can start typing in whatever we want 32.543887 
when we're done typing 34.709747  we can hit the
Escape key two times  37.172040 and that gets out
of our text tool gets into our selection
tool 41.261839  and then we can click on the text
drag it around 44.173773  we can do anything that
we would do to a shape  47.711663 so we can resize
it essentially it's a text object is
what it is 51.989599  and so we can resize it on a
single axis 54.546537  we can click it a second
time 5 and then we can rotate 58.794269  it around we
can skew it kind of create some
unofficial
italics I guess  63.990623 we can change the color
come down here we can change the color
of the text 68.773258  we can change if we want to
have it be like a yellow text  we want to
have it have a border 75.118776  we can actually
come down and hold shift just like we
would anything else we can choose a
color like blue 80.634627  while holding shift and
I'll change the stroke  84.133481 the stroke color
of this text  86.815845 we can also get into the
fill and Stroke properties 89.894768  so we can
right click and go a fill and Stroke 92.118670  and
so we have these same properties that we
applied to our shapes and past tutorials  95.573017 
so for example with our fill if we
wanted to have a gradient instead  99.602115 it
would apply a gradient mmm 101.949616  it's not you
can't tell as dramatically with yellow 104.203190 
but we can come over here and do a
pattern 106.233949  instead so we can do like this
wavy pattern  108.793805 and it creates these waves 110.019205 
through here with the blue stroke 112.550517  we can
also go into stroke and turn off the
stroke  115.075744 so it's just waves but that's not
very legible 117.985351  yeah so that's one thing we
can do  121.963435 I'll come back to my selection
we'll just bring it up here  125.605633 we'll resize
this down a little bit  127.679379 and at any time
if we want to change the text 130.011315 we can
double click  130.915285 and we can get in here  132.731155 and
start typing more 134.084588 
you can do multi-line so if we hit enter
right now   it'll do a second line  139.367219 and we
can do you know multi-line here 143.665102  and so
then these are all one object 146.437287  if we hit
the Escape key two times 148.573022  we're back out
and we can then rotate all of this
together 151.749688 
we can move it all together 153.574539  it's all
just one big box of text 155.478524  if I hit the
minus key and zoom out scroll down a
little bit 158.806854  we can come back to the text
tool again 161.157417  and create a second text area 162.898606 
and we'll just type whatever 165.508870  we want we
still have our text tool selected so if
we click anywhere else  168.754534 it will create
another text area 170.180938  and yeah that's what
we can do  174.974533 now if we want to change the
font 177.052891  or we want to change the font size 179.184856 
so we can just scale the text up like
this  181.334507 but if we want to change the actual
font we can go up here to text  185.521608 and click
text and font 187.328538  and it creates a nice text
options area here on the right hand side 192.069807 
and we can look at these different
options including the font  194.657566 so if we find
a nice font that we want to use 197.569815  just
hitting the down arrow keys till I and
it gives us a nice demo demonstration of
what the font will look like  202.637790 pretty
similar to if you used any other 205.393729  you
know word processing software  208.666075 will find
a good font that we like maybe we'll do
this one so we hit apply and changes to
this type font   215.143394 we can change the font
size here 217.109967  if we want to get a specific
size of our for our font 219.951359  instead of just
freehand scaling it  222.543542 we can also do 224.475365  so we
want to make this I select this talk
text box here 227.567191  and the settings for are
going to appear over here instantly so
whatever we have selected will be in our
options area over here 236.471309  we can do
justification so if we want to do
centered we can hit the align to Center 241.803599 
and then hit apply now all of our text
is kind of centered  245.121920 it's kind of hard to
tell because it's skewed also  246.980557 but we can
do right justified and hit apply so now
all of our text is to the right-hand
side of this box or by default it was
left justified 254.859404  so we have it justified
to the left there again 258.083436  what else can we
do 260.247657  so we have like if you're familiar
with text you there's like letting and
spacing so if we want to change this
space 
between these different lines  269.791561 what we
could do is break these out and have
them be separate objects 273.602923  and then space
it like that  275.731690 but we can also just
double-click so once we're in here to
where we can edit the text or type in
more text  281.799698 we can hold down the Alt +
Shift key at the same time 286.903532 and then do
the greater than and less than  291.423825 keys and
that will change that whole line 294.459559  to like
adjust the spacing between those letters 298.427985 
what we can also do I'll come down here 301.212136 
and do it a little bit so if we zoom in
here 303.746152  and we want to do  305.495590 let's take this
one and just call it TJ free 309.095524  now if we
just select a certain letter  I'll hold
down the shift key  312.405024 and highlight just
one letter like the J  314.324796 we can while
holding the Alt key  316.566079 we can press the up
and down arrow keys 318.397819  and we can actually
move that around we can we can also do
left and right  323.242093 so we can move around
just a single letter 326.696052  I'll come over
maybe take the R and hold down alt  329.906051 and
press the up arrow key 331.497005  and take this e
 333.041884 this last E and hold down alt and press
the down arrow key to bring it in a
little bit 338.494017  so we see we can actually
kind of change this all around however
we want take this T maybe bring it up  346.145882 so
now we've got this kind of cool font
thing going on 350.037912  and then we can actually
just take 352.488023  and well we're not to
highlight it  354.101947 we can just wall it
selected we can change the font 356.436877  and
it'll it'll keep it  358.433881 you know in that
same keep the same spacing or
orientation  363.880383 we've set for these fonts
which is kind of cool 366.356784  what else  368.881963 okay I
thought if one more thing I want to show
you with the text in Inkscape  373.780160 so it's
actually under extensions 375.713985  and we have
this text option under extensions 379.733336  and so
you can do some pretty cool things with
it if we just select the box  that has a
text in it and we go to extensions  385.810646 and
down to text  386.886587 we can for example change
the case 389.485451  so if I want to change all this 390.586773 
to lower case  391.779724 I just do that extension
and all of a sudden this is all lower
case 395.622230  if the T was capital 397.695412  and the F was
capital  399.395614 we can also go to
tension  401.400917 extensions   and go to text 403.643412  and
then go to change case flip case so that
makes anything that was a capital a
lowercase anything there was a lowercase
a capital  411.363025 so that's pretty cool and then
also if we select this text here that
has like three words in it 416.538816  we can go to
extensions  418.775786 because if you want we can
break these up into separate text boxes 421.816005 
right now  they all just they all just
move together 424.783790  if we change the color
they all change the same color together 427.430844 
but while it's wet that if we go to
extensions text 431.151355  we can go to that split
tags to the very bottom 437.353094  and then we can
split by lines  439.409395 if there's multiple lines
this one doesn't this normally has one
line  442.273170 but we can split by words 444.024987  and then
hit apply  446.093300 and now we have separate so we
have our original one still 449.748924  but we also
have all three separate words 453.060428  so if we
want to apply different colors to them
simply  455.575870 we can do that if we want to make
one of them like a larger size  than the
rest of them  459.859984 we can do that 460.830360 
and also we can do the same thing with
like tj3 if we go to filters  464.454112 or we go to
extensions I mean  466.149682 and go to text let's
make it all  467.621690 let's make it all uppercase 471.245668 
and then let's select it again  472.872715 we can
break out every single letter 475.501814  sometimes
with a logo you'll want to do this so we
go to text split text 478.874638  and we'll split it
by letters 481.733976  and hit apply  482.619980 so now we have
all those letters separately  484.854867 it makes a
copy so we have our original here  487.138892 and
then all the copy there  488.304792 we can delete
the original 489.659996  and then we have every
letter is its own little object now  494.747404 and
so now we can you know color it
accordingly or change the font of just
the T and the J 501.236003  so there's different
yeah a lot of times when I'm doing like
logo design I'll I'll break them out
like this  507.620967 and then that way I can do
different things with them  510.617603 however I
want to  512.069052 so that's the text tool oh okay
I actually one more thing I'll show you 515.536894 
I always think of things last minute
so one thing cool we can do if we draw
like a circle here 521.544546  and then we can
actually select some text  527.012868 and then hold
down shift and select any object that we
draw  530.612791 and then we can go to
texts I think  534.811575 and then we go put on path 536.168720 
and that puts the text on the path of
the circle and then we can rotate the
circle around  541.043156 and we can see that text 542.704798 
stays you know map to that path  546.165333 and we
can actually click the circle and have
it have no no happy all transparent no
stroke no fill  553.992755 but we can still have
just this text and then we can rotate it 556.536660 
and oh where'd it go 558.785316 
but you see to the point so it's kinda
like art you do have a vehicle have a
rainbow   and have your text  564.102857  going along
that rainbow  566.102949 and then you can still edit
it while it's in there too which is
pretty cool  570.024465 when you keep typing it
types around in that circle 572.364804  yeah so
that's the text tool just a couple
things you can do play with some of
those if they've piqued your interest 577.981413 
and go ahead and subscribe like comment
below  581.540294 and I'll catch on the next video
