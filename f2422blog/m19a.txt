welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial  5.446617 in this video I want to show
you how to import an illustrator file 10.799128  so
maybe you've you have a file that's a
dot ai file extension a file created in
Adobe Illustrator  16.914075 but you want to work
on it or change it or edit it in
Inkscape  20.431278 not a problem because Inkscape
can import illustrator files 25.474312  so as long
as it's not too complex 27.529353 
there's no usually not problem  29.210683 so I
found this file here 30.591469  that's on
pixabay.com it's a simple illustration
of an ice cream cone 34.163557  and this is by user
alma in progress 36.658020  they've released it
under Creative Commons 0 so free for
commercial users no attribution required
we really appreciate them sharing this
with us 42.671224  and we can actually download the
original Illustrator file 45.628810  that they use
to create this  47.258027 so I already downloaded
it go head and click download under the
illustrator file not under an image  52.617360 but
make sure you get the vector graphic 54.804563  and
I have that saved on my computer right
here in my downloads folder  58.794908 and if I try
and open it 60.609510  I don't have any I don't
have illustrator installed on my
computer  63.465371 so I can't open it in
Illustrator  65.354016 but I can just drag and drop
it in to Inkscape or 69.823545  I can also go file
import  71.808689 and we see we have if we go to
the file type we have all these
different options  75.837387 for different files
that are supported by Inkscape to import 80.129362 
some of them are like  81.425977 we have some
pretty cool ones actually here  83.670390 so all
kinds of different file formats but 86.182561  we
find the one here  87.378049 that is Adobe
Illustrator so there's two we've got
Adobe Illustrator SVG and Adobe
Illustrator 8.0 and below  95.141426 I'm not sure
what this is  96.294478 so I'm not going to import
it this way 98.140416  I'm just going to drag and
drop it in and it'll automatically
detect what it is 101.681049  and it brings up this
dialog 102.985834  we'll just keep all the settings
the same and hit OK 104.843538  and now we have this
ice cream cone here in Inkscape  108.195133 we can
resize it  112.204107 and we can click the plus sign
to zoom in on it  114.522001 if we want to change so
we can see if it has different layers 118.349555  we
go to layers and see so there's no layer
information   so it's probably all just on
one layer  123.047493 we can ungroup here by hitting
ctrl shift G 126.973947 
and now we have this the ice cream the
three scoops are separated from the cone 132.709038 
and the cone is separated from itself 134.725324  so
that's kind of cool  136.900613 and these we can
probably ungroup to 138.792890  control shift G and
now we see we have control shift G you
do it again  144.067856 so now we have three
separate ice cream scoops  148.011030 and we can
change maybe we just want to be like you
know what we love this vector graphic 152.275830 
but we'd rather we had like a light blue
ice cream  155.170718 and we'd rather this one was
like more of a purpley color 158.378046  and we want
the top one to be like a red  161.180937 so were
like cool there no problem then we can
regroup or we can be like yeah we wish
the purple was like off to the side like
this  168.281825 so it was sort of like created this
look  169.884543 so we can change it however we want 171.676550 
because we have this original source
file  173.753900 which is awesome  174.597908 and maybe the comb
we want to apply a different texture or 177.438735 
we want to change the color of it to
make it like a darker  179.860779 I don't know
whatever we want to do 182.619682  but we can do it
because we've got the source file and we
can read Adobe Illustrator files in
Inkscape 187.975554  yeah so I hope you found this
video informative 191.327965  check it out actually 192.601788 
ctrl G we can even add an additional
scoop if we wanted to on here  197.365532 so we can
be like yeah boom  199.920222 and then bring the
glow up to the top level 204.284456  yeah
yeah so that's it you get the idea and
you can find lots of source files if
you're curious on pixabay these are all
I just searched I actually searched for
Adobe Illustrator files but 216.295417  under vector
graphics you can just search for
whatever you want  219.147730 and it will it'll find
all kinds of files that you can download 223.574991 
and actually bring in to Inkscape and
edit change colors or have a lot more
control than you would often just a
regular picture 231.763806  this would be a cool one
to play with  234.821437 and again we can just see
this is a vector graphic so it has a
transparent background  238.896301 we can change the
color of the paint to blue  241.702317 fairly easy
in Inkscape  243.547966 using this method  244.910480 hopefully
