 1.407542 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial  4.906461 Inkscape is a great free
program for creating apparel designs
like t-shirts ball caps jackets and so
in this video I want to quickly show you
how I would go about creating a t-shirt
design in Inkscape  17.045648 there's a couple
things we want to do pay no attention to
the actual page because we're gonna be
scaling up our artworks going up or down 24.235133 
and so I'm just going over here to have
the page be to the right there  27.601009 i
missionary actually come over here to
this tool 30.518562  it's the draw bezier curve
tool 33.117874  and i'm gonna actually use the left
click a few different points  36.207796 and what i
want to do is create the outline of a
t-shirt  40.326531 and so i'm gonna roughly do this
and it's gonna be it's not gonna work
out so great so i'm gonna modify it
afterwards so don't worry if you don't
get it exactly the way you want first
thing  49.609109 cuz we can go to the selection
tool and double-click 52.771338  and then we can
actually come over and kind of just
bring in these notes a little bit  57.124608 and
make it look a little bit more 59.470761  how
everyone you know if the sleeves are
kind of wide like this it's kind of like
cartoony but since this is gonna be an
actual  66.357375 we're trying to do a concept and
get a visualization for what the artwork
will look like on a t-shirt 72.690053 
i'm gonna try and make it a little bit
more kind of more realistic and still
you may not be perfect  79.802523 but we'll make it
look a little more realistic 81.274392  that's not
too bad there  83.219546 and then I'm gonna
actually if we click on a line we can
put a little bend here like in the
neckline  87.872780 it's kind of a wide neckline 89.063929 
but it works I'll put that back there 90.284360 
okay cool so now this will be our our
shirt that we're gonna be using as a
concept  99.676191 and so I'm gonna actually make
it some different colors 102.285742  I will if we
click down here  104.070688 we can see it turns like
a different color  106.774289 but it still has that
black outline which does make it look
kind of not very good I don't think so 110.794351 
I'm gonna hold down the shift key and
click on this white with with an X on it
in the bottom left hand corner  116.346348 and now
that goes away so we have just the shirt 119.442233 
and then I'm gonna select it and I can
either go ctrl D to duplicate  124.217333 I can
right click and go copy and then right
click and go paste  127.894641 I want to get a
couple different copies here  130.460059 maybe I'll
come up here we can also while it's
selected 133.710667 
we can just grab it and 135.187441  hover over and
hit the spacebar  136.959611 and it kind of like
just stamps or puts a copy of one right
where we put it  141.778078 so now we have a bunch
of different yellow t-shirt so we can
click on one and change the color  146.442353 so we
can do like a blue we can do a green
here 149.855966  we can come and grab it you know
whatever kind of colors were thinking we
might want to do for a shirt we can do 157.915934 
let's do one maybe like this 160.049252 
and then for a white if we do exactly
white it just blends in with our
background  165.130346 which is actually transparent
but  167.058058 if we do a couple shades up like
this  169.063387 we can kind of give it the look of
a white shirt by making it a couple
shades of gray  173.928339 maybe we'll do black and
we'll come one there one or two shades
down from black to make it make it look
like a black t-shirt  181.147581 and then yellow we
can keep yellow like that we can also
right click and go fill  185.571535 and Stroke and
we can also change the color this way if
I want to fine-tune and create like a
cool orange II can assure it or
something 193.149648  let's make that one I kind of
like it yellow maybe make a little more
dull  197.744773 alright so now we have a couple
different shirts I want you to do is put
our logo on them  202.167575 and so you probably
already have your artwork I'm not gonna
spend time creating artwork but
basically you just want to make sure
that you have I'll talk about a couple
different considerations for your
artwork  212.464502 so you want to make sure you
don't have any opacity on it like this 217.447400 
you'll want to create the the look
you're going for without achieving
opacity 222.170170  so to create kind of this look 223.806558 
we actually would change the color or
something like this 228.369703  and keep it full
opacity that makes sense 230.656252  also we don't
want to do any blurs we don't have a
blur on there because sometimes you like
what I'll do is I'll create like I'll
draw something in the background like
this  239.791975 and then I'll give it a blur and
bring down the opacity to create an
effect well that looks okay for like
this gives it like the glow behind it 250.044515 
might look okay for like web design or
like ad banners but on printed media we
don't want that I don't want that on
business cards we don't want it on
t-shirts anything is to be printed we
want nice hard lines  261.060384 as a rule of thumb
also we don't want gradients so we want
to introduce a gradient in here because
that's gonna be difficult
as well  268.114116 okay control Z to undo those
changes  270.944258 but we'll probably do some text
down here so whatever is the name of
your businesses a lot of times if it's
something like this 278.004382  I'll actually will
control Z if the shirts getting in our
way we can lock it but I'm just going to
leave it there for now we could put on a
different layer 287.509603  I'm gonna sometimes with
text I'll get two different ones  291.465917 not in
there 293.431813  so I'll have one part of it be
here 296.028934  and I'll have one part of it be
here  297.592216 that just lets us easily change the
cover we can select a certain letter and
change the letters by a different covers
like this as well  304.260702 if we wanted to but I
like to separate it out to completely
separate 307.850506  and that way we can have you
know a different  312.039061 do this special color
so we do this text  314.090681 that way we have
different options for each one we could
do a different font if we wanted to for
each different one or we can change the
size and have you know Co be larger  324.979149 if I
hold ctrl while I scale this it doesn't
get distorted 328.509469 
doot-doot-doot anyway this is a kind of
outside the scope actually designing
outside the scope and potentially
outside of my skill set to design a
decent-looking logo 340.732520  so we're just gonna
say that this is our logo right here  343.769598 and
maybe we'll put it yeah we like that but
now the point is we can actually take
this  349.668098 and go ctrl D and we can zoom out
we can see what it'll look like so maybe
where we want this to be
oh I'm snapping I have notes snap
enabled so I'm going to disable that so
it doesn't bother me 361.054662  but we can see what
this will look like I'm going to turn on
this scale is proportionally every time 365.273555 
we can see what it look like if it's in
the corner of the t-shirt we can see
what it looks like against certain
backgrounds  372.454726 so we can control D we can
just stamp this on each one of these  376.150831 and
see kind of how it'll look  378.839402 maybe we want
the back maybe we actually want this 381.816054 
like this shirt here to be the same as
this color here so we just select this
select this 388.574641 and then give the color
dropper and make it the same and then
this can be like the front of the shirt 394.185786 
and this will be the back of the shirt 395.720634 
so the back we want this to be here and
we don't want to say Bisco we want to
just be just a
star or something  and then  403.805855 the fronts
like this so we can create some
different kinds of concepts 406.083134  again like
the artwork doesn't you'll you'll have
your artwork figured out hopefully and
drawn 411.220536  and then this just helps you see
where it is 413.050748 
so that but what I really want to talk
about is exporting for your printer so
when you have this professionally
printed  418.836612 either if you're having it a web
company do it or all your local printer 423.188143 
you're gonna want to see a couple things 425.270817 
one they might want to see the original
source file so in that case just go to
file save and then just save it as an
SVG  432.848489 so we can put it under put this
under pictures maybe  436.860135 and we'll call this
shirts SVG  441.769393 and then that saves our
actual vector file we could send them
but a lot of printers don't want that
what they really just want is a high
resolution image of just your logo
exactly how it needs to be printed on
the shirt 454.395140  and they also need reference
for where it's going to be on the shirt 458.312232 
so what we would do is send them
something like this  461.106807 we'd send them just
a front and a back 464.238538  as a concept so we go
to file and then we go to export PNG
image  469.737306 we choose a location where it's
going to be saved so under pictures  473.099867 and
then we'd call this shirt concept or
whatever dot PNG  480.144320 and hit save and then
hit export and that exports that to our
that location on the computer 486.152335  so we can
go find those over in picture pictures 488.378981 
and we can see what that looks like  490.584498 so
sure enough we have a nice concept here
of what the shirts will look like
against the transparent backgrounds  we
could send this to them   497.895147  we could even
put a cover on the background if we
wanted to to make it appear nicer for
them 503.666328  and then we can also or we need to
also send just the high-resolution
images  510.186324 so if it's a front and back or
different we would do that differently
but we just select the actual artwork 515.694416 
I'm going to duplicate it and bring it
out here just to white empty space 519.449178  and
this is the most important part 521.140486  doesn't
matter if we scale it up or down here or
what we do because we're gonna change
the settings over here on the export PNG
anyway since this is all vector work 529.916953 
we're gonna select the whole thing come
over here to our export settings which
we got
file export PNG image  536.627878 will choose the
location first of all  538.888982 so we'll send it
to pictures and we'll call this artwork
for shirt dot PNG  546.965187 and hit save and now
this is where it's important that we
changed the actual pixels for this we
want to make it be like six hundred dpi
or maybe your printer will have
different settings  557.061482 that they won't ask
for but as a rule of thumb it's good to
do something like three or six hundred
dpi  that's dots per inch  564.152018 for the
resolution  565.360494 and then we also want the
width here maybe have this to be
something like 2000 by 2000  570.048042 you can't
really go wrong making it too large I
mean I guess you could make it
incredibly like way too large but you
should err on the side of making your
artwork too large as far then rather
than having it too small 581.556144  if it's too
small I'll show you if we do like 20 by
would do 20 by 25 and go to export  588.264221 and
then we go to find that  591.253373 where did I put
it artwork for a shirt then when we open
it up we're gonna see it's actually this
is a very good you know this is just so
small that it's all blurry see we can't
even read the words or anything on there 606.165511 
so that was a problem 608.441240  and so we what we
need to do is over here make it  612.042432 we
select it again  614.290204 select the whole thing
and then we'll make it 600 by 600 and
I'll make this 2000 2000 by 2500 roughly
that's pretty good  627.167268 okay perfect and we
will again choose location will
overwrite that artwork one save export
and now  636.053459 and this could take a little bit
longer to you know depending on your
computer and the size and the complexity
of your work 641.631958  you'll know that if it
takes a long time to export 644.148932  or you know
a couple seconds that you've got the
right one  647.623662 so we go to the artwork now
and take a look  650.758255 and we should be able to
see this very nice 654.262182 
so this is what they'll receive and this
just has a transparent background and so
all that we printed on the shirt is this
so they can put on any color they want 664.144578 
and that's kind of the reason that we
went and went ahead and did this and got
all these different shirts 668.580791  we can see we
can see roughly whether it will look
like against white or against 671.474267  blue and
then we can also draw like a ball cap or
draw a pair of jeans or a jacket and
kind of come you know do this whole
design conceptualization for ourselves 681.496885 
maybe you want to export just this and
share it to like a Kickstarter page to
show what this shirt will look like you
know there's lots of different options
for this for designing it whether you're
gonna be displaying it like I said on a
website to show what your shirt looks
like for people that order  697.039710 it or if you
want to actually design and then send to
the printer  699.861752 but when you're sending it
to a professional printer just make sure
you have your artwork really high DPI a
really large image and then also send
them the actual source file 710.313623 that SVG
image in case they need to make minor
tweaks or changes 714.651568  and maybe it's a good
idea to to export just the artwork as a
source file without all that the shirts 719.961468 
but they should be able to get in there 721.624286 
and make changes too  722.867792 so hopefully that's
been informative for you I've done this
process quite a bit actually I'm using
Inkscape to create printed 728.703294  printed
artwork for t-shirts and ball caps  732.279285 and
different types of apparel and it works
really really well  735.628634 and so when you do it
right you know the printer doesn't
sometimes they say like it has to be an
Adobe Illustrator file 742.685947  but it doesn't
and if they want your business 744.573429  they'll
accept just a you know a raw SVG file 747.867988  or
a high-resolution PNG image  749.829462 thanks for
