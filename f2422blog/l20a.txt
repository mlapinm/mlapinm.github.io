 1.715123 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial 5.728059  in this tutorial we're going to
be looking at the align and distribute
tool to help keep our objects and text
anything we that we draw lined up and
square it up with the page with each
other and looking awesome 16.703357 

 so I'm going
to come out here so we can see the whole
page  19.641479 I'm gonna open up well first we'll
just draw let's draw a star 24.169398  a nice black
star we'll put right in  25.865620 the middle here 26.953446 
and then we'll go to our object go all
the way down to a line and distribute 31.090377  we
can also open it by pressing control
shift a 33.754365  that's what it tells us 35.406093  that
brings up our panel over here on the
right hand side  37.721915 for our line and
distribute  38.974119 so there's a couple different
so first of all this  44.305479 lets us align this
align whatever object we have relative
to a couple different sources 49.114121  by default
is relative to selection area which
means if I have another say I draw like
a rectangle 57.701865  and make it red and I make
it the size of the page or I make it not
even the size of the page 63.911234  let's just
make it like this and I lower it down to
the lower level below the star  68.403413 and I
want this star to be in the center of
this red box  71.640506 I can just select the whole
selection area  75.395550 and so based on this
whole basically this dotted line 79.475648  this
star I can Center it to this to the
middle of that selection area 84.171410  I can
Center it this way  86.395362 I can push it all the
way to the left so it so the first part
of the star touches the very left side
of the selection box  94.346586 I can push it to
the right 96.263427  push it at the top but I
usually do this for centering things so
I'll go Center  102.795530 on the what is this
x-axis y-axis  106.891435 and then Center along here
on the horizontal 109.659489  horizontal vertical
guess which call it  111.428078 that another thing
we can do if I click this red box and
delete it we can Center this star if we
change this relative to the page  118.539502 now we
can Center the star relative to the page 121.147766 
so now if I Center it it will center on
the page  124.067579 vertically and we can Center on
the page horizontally  as well 128.275386  so now we
have this star centered on our printed
page  131.112282 or on our page what
whatever we're designing on 135.592128  what else
can we do relative to 137.608186  so we can go
relative to if I draw a circle here 140.867770  and
I put it down to the bottom level 144.203929  we can
Center or we can align based on the
first object selected  152.279772 so based on the
first selected so if I select the star
first  155.316795 then I go shift and select this
red circle 158.957029  and then we go to center 160.468471  it's
going to Center this circle based on the
center of the star  164.916993 so it'll find the
center of the star and align the center
of the circle to the star center 168.864735  so see
the star stays in the same place but the
circle goes there 172.548933  if we want to do it
differently  173.697426 we can do if we select the
star the circle first  177.725332 and then hold
shift and select the star 180.085351  now it'll be
whatever we whatever we apply will be
based off of the circle  187.005968 kind of like it
was the first time  188.801596 only it's not
selection now  190.161417 it's first selected  191.409687 we can
also do it by like smallest objects 193.853598  we
can do it based off of our  196.277374 we won't use
based off for drawing  198.917368 but I want to show
you with multiple options with multiple
items 201.557324  so maybe we want to do since we
have a circle already let's create it
like a light blue color 206.841399  and let's shrink
it down  208.861513 let's just go duplicate this and
duplicate this  212.733616 and we'll make a snowman 215.201824 
so we have a snowman here 218.138230  actually we'll
use something that we did in our last
tutorial which is we'll select all three
of these  222.326103 and we will go to object or
we'll go to path Union 227.261688  and make them all
one thing and that way when we go to our
if I hold down shift and will give it a
nice blue outline 233.005324  so now we have a
nice-looking little snowman here  234.581379 and we
want to create some buttons on the
Snowman  237.405726 so we'll create a button 239.177604  and
we'll make it we'll just make the whole
thing black sure black with a blue
outline 243.558525  so we have some buttons  here 245.322322  and
I controlled D I can duplicate this
button 247.978313  ctrl D and duplicate so now we
have three  250.978326 let's do let's do three
buttons if I want to align these so
they're centered with the Snowman I can
do it a couple ways relative to first
selected I can select the Snowman  260.871321 then
hold shift and select all three buttons 264.359175 
then just go to the center  266.459113 now they're
all sent
on the snowman 268.795244  and I did I only want to
center them along this axis not along
the other axe not 275.435241  vertically if I Center
and vertically they'll all be on top of
each other  278.583274 so there's like three on top
of each other 280.695227  now so what I want to do
is actually well the reason I have three
of these is because if ever we want we
can select all three of them like this 289.151305 
or I can hold down the shift and select
all three  292.414909 and then we can distribute so
we've got a line we also have distribute 297.035196 
and distribute we can we can get make
easy even spacing be between based on
the center of these three objects  304.994235 we can
have them be spaced evenly apart
horizontally so to do that we do 309.682813  this
one right here distribute centers 312.718799 
equidistantly equidistantly and there
you go 316.527418  so let's we could switch to the
center of them with each other  318.639020 first and
now we can make sure there's an equal
distance between each one 322.662834  so if we drag
this one down here and this one here we
can give an equal distance by selecting
them all 327.335087  and then doing this here 328.915253  since
the circle all three of these are gonna
do the same thing really  332.783241 it's just what
point it's based off of if they were
stars it might be a little bit different 336.619159 
so this is based off at the top point
the top edge this is based off at the
bottom edge  341.086962 this one just makes the
space in between them  344.646894 be equal so if one
of them was a star  347.359049 if we select and
delete  349.167593 we'd bring the star in here  350.707763 so
this might be a little different we
probably I would want to do centers  354.824006 as
well so I Center them all together  356.083519 and
then I distribute them based  360.816284 on the
Centers of them does that make sense 364.107505 
and it really comes in handy if we have
if we were to control D on all of these
and control D again  370.495642 so if we get a whole
bunch of things going on here like this 372.979593 
and we just drag them all over here 376.316656  so
now we want to create a nice line if we
want all these to be lined up first of
all we just Center them all to each
other basically 383.736031  to the first selected I
guess is what it did  385.880307 and then if I want
to make them relative to each other or
distribute them relative to each other 
we just do this  393.037036 now they're all
distributed based on the center point
the center point of each is equally is
equal  399.103422 and if we wanted to do it slightly
different we could
they use the top edge of each object 404.264150  and
use that as the align point 406.350035  so now these
stars are down a little bit it looks
like there might be a little off-center
but it's because it's basically basing
it off at the top edge of that 414.073775  so I
would probably keep this one here  415.825719 to do
that or  417.077519 this one which does equal
spacing between the gaps 420.553621  so it uses the
bottom and top edge and make sure the
white space between each object is the
same size 426.038402  yeah you can have as many
object you know objects in a line as you
wanted to to do that 431.646281  we can shrink these
down  433.533790 and put them in here 434.745957 
that's pretty cool anyway that's a line
and distribute  438.910246 so just play with that
there's some more things we can do with
it but basically make sure you
understand this relative to I like to do
page if I'm working on if I'm working
within the page like a printed page or
something 450.817837  and then I'll also do
selection area a lot of times too so
Center it based on a selection area  456.581755   yeah
play with that different options there 460.219160 
but it's become super powerful 461.767890  when you
want to do have things line up properly
if you have lines especially or little
objects like this  468.355504 it can become really
nice tool  470.647718 to have in fact I should have
lined these up before I union them
together  473.739427 I should have lined these so
they were all three in a straight line 476.979555 
thanks for watching this video  478.835385 on a line
undistribute play with this tool learn
how to use a little bit better 481.855501  and I'll
catch you in the next video 483.567668  483.567668  483.567668
