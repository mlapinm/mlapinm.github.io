 1.874898 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial  5.369852 in this video we're going to be
looking at the layers option in Inkscape 11.218565 
and working with layers  12.507588 it's a great
skill to learn if you've used a
Photoshop or before you're probably
familiar with working in layers other
software has it too 23.058649  so we have a whole
tab up here or a whole drop down menu
dedicated to layers in Inkscape 29.418545  and to
bring up the layers menu we just go all
the way to the bottom of this or we can
hit ctrl shift
L 38.074106  and it brings up this layers dialog
over here 40.634711  so by default everything we
draw ending scape is just going to be on
one layer 45.241994  and I'm gonna change my fill
and Stroke settings so I'm like the
object 49.958422 
fill and Stroke  51.362806 because I had I had some
things changed last time  53.330526 I think I had 54.370994 
didn't I have a blur 55.786749 
well we'll keep this change our color a
little bit 60.038824  and i'ma try to have any blur
or opacity going on  62.994782 and also when I
brought up filling strokes and our
layers went somewhere  69.578371 it's right down
here we can click it and bring it back
up  72.123035 so you can toggle between open
windows that you have  74.587084 this way
they'll just appear right down below 77.222987 
sometimes if you dock them  78.678629 they'll
appear here on the side  80.330858 so we can see we
have layers here  82.030786 fill and Stroke here we
just click on layers to bring it back 86.386747  ok
so this is everything is drawn on layer
1 we know that because if we look down
here  at the bottom we see layer 1  92.526885 if we
click that's our only layer 94.332962  so let's try
let's do something let's do it may let's
draw a little bit of a scene here  102.174354 so I'm
going to take this rectangle  104.181535 and we'll
put it up like this we'll make it green 108.041282 
and then we'll duplicate it ctrl D 111.093284  and
we'll bring it up here  113.469101 and we'll make
this like a blue like a sky  116.853387 so now we
have like a ground sort of and a sky  119.733312 and
we want this to be our layer 1 okay  123.001225 so
then we'll add a second layer we click
this plus sign  127.117067 new layer name we'll call
it layer 2 129.312797  sure we'll call it layer do
now actually 131.016309  let's call it Sun because
draw a Sun in the sky 135.308966  and it's going to
be added above current layer awesome 138.253187 
then we go back to our layer one  139.752539 we can
double click we can rename it to
background 143.980167  now we have two layers our
background layer and our Sun layer  147.947387 and
what everyone would click on  150.043299 we can look
down here becomes the active layer 153.068192 
so on the Sun layer I'll go ahead and
just draw a Sun  157.132109 and what's happening
here oh there's this it was the same
color I thought it was behind it first 163.223510 
so it looks like a star right now  but if
we double click and go to corners 166.587686  we'll
give it a whole bunch of corners  168.235306 and now
it's the Sun now this green there's
looking like and you noticed we can we
were on here if we click on the Sun 177.516451  we
go to the Sun layer if we click on the
grass we go to the background layer  182.188436 I
want to change the color of the grass 184.287533 
but we can talk we don't have to go to
that layer is what I want to show we
don't have to click on Sun layer before
we can select the Sun 191.027510  we can just click
on whatever 192.927933  we want to but it's on that
different layer  195.607113 and then if we go over
here to the layers  197.335876 we can actually turn
if we want to turn off the background
layer  199.863449 and just not see it we click this
little eye here and it becomes a
something we can't see
now 206.615393  still there we just can't see it
same with the Sun we can turn the Sun on
and off 211.515576  and then we can create a third
let's create a third layer  214.123271 and call it
person now we have a layer called person
and we'll draw a little character here 220.535337 
sort of we'll just draw like a very
simple 227.263541  okay
all right so now I may be a little
character guy here 237.271780  and we can also
choose to not view that layer 240.543552  it's a
separate layer  242.303746 and if we want to like
send this son way back below I don't
think we can do that yeah see if we try
to if we try to lower it down or hit
page down  252.347365 it's already at the lowest
level of this son layer 256.983278  and so we can't
set it back behind the background  262.435573 also
it's going to be if we move it it's
gonna always be behind this person that
we drew  267.731645 and we can't push page up to get
it to go ahead we can't raise it a level 272.472505 
because it's within the levels that it
toggles between  276.392892 are all within its own
layer  278.844732 we can't do that if we want to
move it we can do this  282.968607 with while we're
on the son level   287.025797  we can hit ctrl X and
cut that object 292.276754  and then we can go to
the person level  296.332899   and it's person down
here we could change it down here to
change background change a person 299.712879  and
then we do ctrl V to paste and now the
Sun is on the person level if we turn
off this level  306.136465 we see that they're both
on the same level  309.508704 I'm going to hit ctrl
X  310.876614 will change back to the Sun level
control V and paste it now it's in the
Sun level again  315.501729 levels come in handy
when you're exporting to other programs
sometimes you can it keeps that data  324.776696 and
so you can exit we can I think we can
export this into Kim 327.942157  but we can keep
this especially in animation if we want
to animate this character sometimes it's
nice to be able to have it a separate
layer  336.398194 so that it can animate separately
from everything else without getting too
messy  339.777948 so that's a good reason it also
just helps keep things clean if when you
get lots of objects  345.218371 it can get kind of
messy and sometimes you don't want to I
don't want to accidentally miss click 349.542383 
and try and move his leg 351.206112  and
accidentally move the grass instead 353.470268  so
something we can do about that we can
actually walk a level  358.014153 so we can come
here to the background 359.730520  and click this
lock button and then that becomes locked
so we can't click it in
more 



365.678267  that's pretty cool huh 367.505432  so if we can
still click and move the Sun  369.177785 we can
click and move any part of the sky
around  371.772647 but if we miss click on an
accident  we won't move anything 374.980605  and
maybe we want the Sun just to stay there 376.985218 
and not move we can lock the Sun  379.048009 level
as well or a layer I mean and then that
layer is locked  384.104194 so now all we can move
is just this guy 387.268874  so I hope that's been
an informative introduction to levels in
Inkscape   there's not much more to it
than that  394.948603 oh if we did want to so it's
unlocked the Sun 397.879864  if we did want the Sun
to be over top of this guy 400.856429  we can just
change this by  403.191758 I don't we can drag I
think we can drag the level 405.371683  and do that
what  406.343521 I do oh oh ok so this is good -
good -  412.745477 so I actually just made this a
sub level 415.336752  I just added it into person 417.332432  so
you can have you can have them nested I
guess you'd call it  421.100698 so this is now in
here but we want to be out 424.508851  how do we get
out of there 425.613375 
right click  427.404816 I'm not sure how to get out
now  432.977107 you see what I did I dragged I did
it a drag and drop and I put it as a sub
layer of person  438.920762 so now if we turn off
the person layer it turns off the Sun
and the person because  443.896833 the Sun is a sub
layer 445.464982  so a good thing for this would be
under the person we have all their
clothes  449.684828 and accessories and everything
about them their facial features  452.932719 so we
have facial features as a separate sub
layer of this person layer 458.428739  but my
problem is now I'm not sure how to get
it out of there 461.624689  oh there we go so now
it's out  463.460831 and now I look it's on topic
it's because I did do that move down to
where I wanted to but so we can change
this by going by here  471.848887 we can lower the
current layer and we can lower even
behind the background so we don't see it
at all or we can raise it back up again 479.980758 
so that's a way that you can that's
another good reason to use layers if you
can kind of accomplish same thing with
levels 486.073022  but if you have a lot of objects
it's sometimes good to have separate
layers 490.165890  and it helps you like the name
implies layer objects on top of another
