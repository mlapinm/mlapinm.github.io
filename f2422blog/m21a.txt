 1.421081 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial 4.904625  in this video I want to show
you how to create a custom thumbnail for
your YouTube videos  9.760502 so this is some
thumbnails I created for this tutorial
series using sweet home 3d  16.132456 and I'm gonna
actually just hit print screen right now 19.189746 
and go into Inkscape I'm gonna right
click and go to paste 22.020594  I'm just gonna
paste this screenshot 24.154400  and I'm gonna do
that actually one more time I want to
get a couple different examples  27.866923 we'll
grab some videos here and go print
screen 29.908746  because what I want to do is
actually see what these look like so if
we zoom in here a little bit 36.763548  I can kind
of get an idea for what the thumbnail
will look like  41.900163 so on on the playlist
look at this the times the the length of
the video kind of covers up the bottom
right-hand corner of the video 50.254651  and if we
come over here to these other ones just
a regular one it's not as this is a
larger video 56.740710  so the time stamp doesn't
take up as much space 58.320831  there's also a
little clock in the top right-hand
corner   they could cover something 61.919601  so
when I'm designing this thumbnail 63.870474  I'm
gonna want to make sure I keep the top
right hand corner 66.373025  and that bottom
right-hand corner kind of don't have
anything very important there that'll
get covered up 72.841910  see when I designed these
ones I actually didn't consider that
very well 75.978339  because I have the logo here 78.365815 
that kind of gets covered up when it's
in the playlist view 81.505387  so in designing
this one I'm gonna change that a little
bit  84.909449 so what I can do first of all I'm
just gonna I'll just get my rectangle
tool  and I'll draw a little rectangle
here 90.718295  and I'll make it maybe like a
lighter gray 94.248345  and turn the opacity way
down so I can kind of see through it a
little bit 97.290909  maybe we'll make it like red 99.296808 
so we can see what's going on here 100.567905  okay
perfect 101.403913 
so this is kind of the the size  103.110869 and then
I actually I'm gonna want to go 105.089112  I'm
gonna kind of just try and kind of match
this so I'll get my text and I'll just
type in  111.745304 floor plus foundation and I
happen to know the font that I used for
this if I go into my text 119.844851  and text and
font what I used was next bold and we go
to apply 128.055285  and so now we have a nice neck
so bold here 131.324408 
then I believe  133.249851 that's control Z control
Z 137.429311  so I believe I'm going to lock this
lock here so that kind of constrains it
to X and y axis when I resize it so it
doesn't get out of there we go 146.766448  so it
looks pretty good 147.700706  so now what I've done
here is sort of sort of copied this yeah 155.404110 
I can go ctrl D to duplicate  159.113169 I can come
down here and rename this part down here 164.407633 
is called lesson two 168.421141  so I'm copying my
own work here   but I'm just showing you
an example of what you can do if you
find the thumbnail you kind of like and
you want to pattern it after 174.656861  so
basically I've kind of patterned this 177.499965 
and now we have this is the logo down
here  179.822011 so all this really has is it a
border 181.627653  and then it has a logo or an icon
of the of whatever I'm talking about
because I'm doing tutorial videos on how
to use software 189.250066  then as this banner that
says TJ free across the the bottom there 193.774180 
so I can create that banner I think by
kind of getting a nice blue here I can
actually 199.078313  if I turn my opacity all the
way up or is it that 202.498356  and I can grab my
color picker and actually get the same
color that was used in this video 208.094204  so now
I'm using the same color 210.005138  and I can
rotate it to about the same angle 213.113911  that's
pretty close there 216.234581  maybe I'll just do
this this isn't the best way to do it 
but at least it  221.375379  gets it pretty close
here  224.385910 and doesn't matter that it's
sticking out past the edges because it
just doesn't matter  231.218421 yeah so that's great
and I'll get some text there to say TJ
free I don't know what font that was in
TJ three 237.535755  and we turn out white 239.051773 
oops we turn it white and then we'll
also rotate it 243.167665  oh let me resize it first
 245.766077 so this looks like it's definitely a
different font I wonder if this was a
this baby's baby snowy  258.072089 mmm
apply yeah it is baby snow look at that 261.650601 
one of the most common fonts of all time
used on YouTube 266.241156  so here  we go so now
we've got this nice TJ free here 269.921694  and
I'll rotate it so that it fits perfectly
in there but 272.724203  that's pretty good   274.199654  awesome
now I'm going to go ahead and just
delete this whole thing  277.742141 I'm gonna come
back and we'll change this back to how I
wanted it to be real quick we'll put the  
stroke on  283.580658 and we'll make it 285.266537 
sorry about that when we get pixels what
does  288.815971 I have it at 3 pixels about 289.957388  all
right so this is what it this is what my
my thumbnail is looking like  294.157185 now so I
want to create a that's thumbnail that's
gonna be the same throughout the whole
series just like on this one  302.171308 it's the
same I just changed the text and I say
lesson for lesson 5 I change the text at
the top but everything else stays the
same  309.801444 so I wanna do the same thing for
this one but I want to be Inkscape 312.388853  and
so I have I found the Inkscape logo I
got from Wikipedia 317.117365  and it's actually
here in the pictures yeah I've got it
right here so I'm gonna actually just
drag it in  324.667852 I'm dragging the Inkscape 326.395889  oh
icon into Inkscape  329.905144 and it's actually it
looks like it's really big but that's
because what really happened is this
thing that we designed is really small
so I'm gonna select it  336.916654 let's make it
large in fact let's make it the size
that it really needs to be 341.245752  so to do that
I'm gonna go to file 343.913149  I'm gonna go to
document properties and change my
document to 1920 by 1080  349.074597 that's the size
of the thumbnail and put it in pixels 353.140254 
that's the size of the thumbnail that is
a pretty good you can do smaller to
upload to YouTube but I would recommend
doing 1920 by 1080 that way if someone's
watching on like Roku TV or like if
they're just if they're browsing
fullscreen  369.373411 it'll it'll show up properly 370.937133 
okay so now now I changed my document
properties this is the size of my my
finished thing  378.877240 so I'll just move this on
here and kind of roughly put it in the
same size  383.501422 like that that's pretty good
and then I'm actually gonna click on my
square and make sure that it's exactly
how I want it to be to  391.332302 or my rectangle
so pixels 393.462028  so I'll make it 1920
by 1080 exactly  399.645057 and then I'll just put
it exactly within the constraints of
this document 403.925731  and that's perfect 404.752051 
okay pretty good so this is gonna this
thing let's see I think I want my border
on hit page up  415.174688 or I'll just raise the
top 416.872422  so that it covers up the covers over
top of this this have transparency 421.727558  yes
let's make it 100% and then we'll change
the color of it too  429.089721 I haven't decided
what color I want to do oh yeah I know I
did that's right I want to do grey   so
let's go back to this 435.062494  and let's make it
grey  436.988398 all right and so now I want to move 440.537935 
I want to move this 442.787549  up a little bit I
want that to be centered in there 445.397202  about
like that  446.379407 and now I'm gonna hit ctrl G
and group this  450.094838 and I can move them
together I'm using the arrow keys on my
keyboard right now  453.465335 so about right there
it's pretty good I think 456.478011  for a banner 457.718060 
yeah about how I did on my last one  460.365537 yeah
that's pretty good  463.869195 okay so now I need a
background image  467.211841 well actually I don't
get background image is this 1920 by
1080 I told it to be no it's not 472.570006  oh I
know why  474.551704 I had it locked 1920 by 1080 477.742798 
now it is now I can ReWalk it perfect  481.209499 so
there we go perfect  487.200691 all right now I'm
gonna add in so now I have my my icon
here 494.713702  so I'm going to take it will resize
it down a little bit 497.522770  I'm not sure what
font they use for this so remember I
want to keep out that area at the bottom
right hand corner did i erase that I
think  508.939650 I did but I want to keep that area
free there and that's the whole reason I
brought it in I can't believe I did that
and I hit print screen again  516.593146 and I'm
gonna come paste it and again paste  519.745283 so
really let's make this like super
transparent  524.230916 and then we'll make it 525.928564  we'll
make this kind of
I guess what's the best way to do this  530.207709  
this is not the best way to do this
actually  534.208146 but we'll just give it a try 535.802776  so
what I want to do is kind of make this
the same size  541.486937 as my video down here
which I'm getting close 544.476786  and then I can
see how much of that is taken up 548.343557  by
that's pretty good 551.342951 
so now when I overlay this here 553.043647  and
actually what I'm gonna do is just I'm
gonna take and copy this so I have two
different versions 558.030352  now I go duplicate
move the whole thing over here so it's
out of the way 562.320943  now I can look at this
one 563.329568  I can see all right so it looks like
that takes up quite a bit so that's good
there 568.072815 
I could actually I could still I could
still make this lower just the bottom
here  573.711204 I can still move I can make this
icon larger   576.062136  I can put it anywhere I
don't want to get it here if I put it
here or get covered up so I could put it
even a little bit further over this way 
if I wanted to 583.542560  because I really want to
have some sort of a background image  586.724627 I
think I might just Center it so centered
it centering it should be fine  590.655995 okay good
to know 592.725243  so I'll come back over here  594.267736 I
feel like I'm talking a lot and I hope
I'm not confusing you 598.801926  so what I'm gonna
do I'm gonna go grab all this stuff 602.095276 
I'm gonna go hung out all of it I'm
actually just gonna grab this and then
shift and do this and we're gonna Center
these on each other 608.817927  so I'm going to go
object line and distribute and we'll
Center those up so now this is right in
the center 617.025928  this I don't necessarily want
in the center  619.436333 I want about it I do want
to be lined up I want these to be pushed
like this great 627.954436 
and then we'll put this kind of up here
that's pretty good  632.853630 Oh in this lesson to
was had its own little banner behind it
that's because there was a background
image  639.262440 so I could just export this right
now and we can see what it looks like 642.682345  I
don't love it yet but listen if we just
let's go to export and see so export PNG
we'll export it to the desktop  650.692859 and we'll
call it test one  654.686261 and that's not on my
desktop let's put it on the desktop test
one perfect and then 662.150248  let's make the size
we'll make this like ninety two dpi and
we'll make this 1920 by 1080 perfect 96
dpi very good  672.831790 ok export so now it'll
only export the selection so it should
cut off that banner and we'll see what
that looks like 682.326651 
not bad so it has a transparent
background which is not super great 686.660058  and
it has this TJ free did my last one do
that 689.424895  I can't tell I think the I think
this blue banner did go over the last
one 694.865191  so let's make that happen in this
one too so we have to do that which take
the blue banner 699.838622  and send it raise it to
the top  700.979004 so now it will go over it 702.783419  ok and
then like I said it had a has a
transparent background  707.463513 so it's hard to
tell exactly how it looks  711.716525 so let's put a
background so I thought about using this
at one point in time and maybe I still
will 718.616483 
yeah so let's just drag this guitar and
this is a guitar that I drew inning
scape a while ago when I was first
learning Inkscape 727.227777  so we could put it as
the background 731.731384  to do that 733.446985  we did we just
raise it up like this and then lower it
to the bottom level 736.910283  so that actually
looks pretty good
the only problem is now the Inkscape
logo is not exactly   where I'd want it to
be  745.781111 hmmm no I don't think I want to do
that I have another I have another image
I wanted I want to try  754.607007 and that is this
Nintendo thing that I drew up  757.739032 so that's
kind of a cool thing too  759.544133 so we could try
this one although it has a black
background
I don't love that  765.633318 I wish I had I do have
the original this somewhere  767.933950 well that's
not gonna work at all is it
no 772.870543  so I need to find a good background
image that kind of exemplifies Inkscape 778.065245 
I don't know exactly what to do there 780.059934  I
mean I could I suppose I could just grow
I could just draw something like this 785.502705 
and give it like a gradient 787.783955  let's come
down here to my fill and Stroke where's
that that's right click filling stroke 793.262704 
let's give it a gradient from the center 799.995640 
out let's make it like gray maybe hoops
oh dude gray and with a great gradient
and I'm just lower it all the way down 806.220713 
yeah that is not look that does not look
amazing to me 814.427884  I think this is too 818.420912  oops
this is too  821.433084 dark maybe  824.922556 and I think I
want this to be reversed this gradient
let's try it like that  830.098462 just give it a
little bit of subtle let's give it some
subtle color  834.908495 that's not bad
like white purple could just give it a
color background then we give this more
of a K lighter color so I've been
playing with this for a little bit and I
actually did a couple things so I added
a drop shadow  848.029846 to this I put a little a
little white banner here and I added a
drop shadow to it sort of like a little
black backing to it 856.480821  I added the text to
the Inkscape below 859.453278  I made the icon a
little bit larger and then obviously I
changed it to this sort of blue color
instead of the purple 864.813846  which I think I
like a lot better  865.927580 so now I think I like
this I haven't actually quite exported
it  869.815602 just yet in this version but I'm
gonna do an export real quick here  

872.680632 and
I'll just take it to desktop again 876.821522  and
I'll call this our our our 880.702455  save export
so now I'll take a look at this one 883.731301  and
see what it looks like 885.512318  yeah that looks
pretty good to me 887.432118  I think that'll be
nice  889.203559 I'm not so sure I love that white
now around there but I think it'll be
small enough  895.115392 I don't think people really
notice 896.986455 
but you know what I am gonna take it out 898.231056 
I'm gonna take out this I have this sort
of white  900.975820 actually I'm just gonna what
I'm gonna do I'm gonna come here and
grab just the white part do I have the
white selected yeah and I'm just gonna
actually add a little bit of blur to it 912.123017 
that'll make it look better  913.851973 all right
very cool  915.152262 now so what I need to do is 918.305932  I
need to create a bunch of these so I'm
gonna come over here and delete this so
it's not taking up any space 923.291307  this is my
original Alderley that I'm going to take
and delete this purple one too 927.266084  so now
this is the final one that I want to use 931.085043 
and so everything I really want to do
with this  933.499906 I shouldn't bring it over here 935.567382 
so if I come up here I'm actually gonna
want to copy this a bunch of times 941.515560  so
I'm gonna take this floor and Foundation 943.626856 
and I'll just erase the text and type in
the letter A  947.203098 and then on lesson I can
keep it lesson two it doesn't really
matter  951.255118 then we just go ctrl D  954.485341 and I'll
just move it down here ctrl D  957.187402 so I need
like a bunch of these  959.067094 ctrl D because
what I really need is how many of them
let's come over here and look  965.275589 I really
need 20 okay so I have I have a couple
here 971.757348  and so let's come and just go it'll
take all these ones is five  975.936352 so that I
duplicate this row 977.654419  and now there's 10
and then duplicate it again 980.943861  and now
there's going to be 20 that's awesome
before I get any further I'm gonna save
this file save as  988.711240 I'll save it under my
documents  991.941932 if I can and  993.664228 I'll call it ink
escape tutorial thumbnails 1002.521164  that way if I
ever add a few a video in the future
like the one I'm making now is video 21 1008.189380 
I can add it in there as well 1010.002724 
and I'm just come here to the very very
first top one  1012.564415 and I'm just gonna rename
this  1014.636921 so I'm going to call this one
lesson 1 1017.760945  and take this text and erase
the a and type in basic drawing 1023.989744  and
that's it and that is that thumbnail 1026.468210  so
now I can export this and upload it and
replace
it in here so I'll just show you just a
quick video here I've renamed all of
them so I have all these different
thumbnails now  1038.154761 and I'm just exporting
them  1039.307952  so this is number nine export I
think I redid that one so replace 1042.942257  and
then I've got ten I just select it call
it ten 1046.316310  and then hit export so it's
actually very quick 1048.642332  I have a workflow
once I get all these going it just takes
the selection which is that box   so it
doesn't get anything on the outside of
that box 1055.570643 
I just rename it to what I want to be
called and hit export  1059.091423 so this one's
twelve I click on it make sure it says
twelve and hit export 1063.995796  and then it's
putting all of these on my desktop here 1067.337439 
and I can just go through and see open
up if I want and look through and see
what they look like  1071.778966 and they're nice and
then once I'm done exporting them all 1074.782876 
I'll upload them to YouTube 1078.005950  so that's it 1081.509579 
 1083.497586  1083.497586
