 1.494618 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial 4.993408  in this video I'm creating a 2d
character that will be used in a 2d
animation 10.054091  so first I'm just drawing all
these circles they're just objects then
I select everything  13.754118 and I go to path
object to path I think ctrl shift C is
also the shortcut to do that 20.614120  what that
does is it converts all of these objects
into a path that has different nodes so
I can shape them like I'm doing here 26.643398 
this video is sped up if you can't tell
this is like six or eight hundred speed
I think and so  33.199215 and this is really just
one way to do it you could draw shapes
you could draw squares you could draw
anything really you could even be like a
freehand drawing 39.714052  and then just
manipulate each one of these nodes  42.743031 I'd
draw an object first like a circle and
get sort of my rough frame of my
character  48.734053 and then and then go through
and resize and reshape everything 53.747143  I made
parts of it gray and parts of it black
to show 56.759233  so I can see the overlapping how
different body parts overlap with each
other 61.976209  and so I'm going to be bringing
this into open tombs  66.439108 and I'm going to be
applying like a skeleton rig to it  68.734835 and
so I want to be able to control
different parts of these  71.867002 with a
different connection points 74.534329  that's why
we have like the neck here sort of like
a paper doll 77.435008  type animation  78.663131 and even
everything on the face is gonna be
animated too 82.543034  so i'm gonna export all of
these separately the eyes the eyeballs
the mouth the eyelid eyelashes  89.447158 I think
I'm gonna leave the hair I think I chose
to leave the hair  92.923089 and the nose 94.087046  as as
just part of the head and the neck to
actually connected to the head  99.391113 but
everything else got I export separately 102.219169 
and I'll show you it at the end here for
the hair I just drew I just drew in
everything just by clicking on the nodes 107.914394 
and then I went in and shaped it
individually  110.575149 and I played a lot with
color too so I like to throw on a
background other than white 116.951191  I just kind
of play around with the color I wasn't
really sure where I was going with the
colors and and I kind of played with it
quite a bit  122.911165 oh this part here so I drew
in a belt but I also used it to divide
the upper and lower half of the body
since it was all one 129.999017 
color.all one path so I split that up  134.967218 to
split up a path like this it's underpass
division is what I used 139.155294  these hands gave
me a real problem I spent a ton of time
trying to get him to look good night at
one point in time I was I thought about
doing a mitten like this  148.807098 and I went away
from that idea as well 150.619016  I guess I said
before I'm not really I don't have any
formal training in art and so I don't
really 157.147114  I'm not super great at art
creation but  158.743128 do the best I can
I thought I'd throw a little star on the
shirt here to give it some more
character  163.090960 and I changed the color of the
belt here changing color of the shoes 166.867062 
that's one of the nice things about
Inkscape is it's really easy to get in
and change colors 171.434474  and and do things
after the fact  173.235095 so I grouped all the skin
together and then changed it all at at
the same time 177.674401  same with the shirt it's
all grouped a lot of these different
things are grouped so I can change the
color of the group instead of each
individual item  184.976453 put a little belt buckle
on here for some character  188.230951 yeah that's
about it these characters coming
together  192.411186 the next thing I need to do is
separate out different items  197.163072 so what I
do I make it copy so I have a duplicate
copy of the whole character 201.064595  and I just
separate out each individual part that I
want to have so this is even though
there's different parts here I group
like the whole body section  207.964006 I just bring
out everything separately that I want to
to export out because in open toons 214.372804  or
in other software too  215.973725 I'm gonna want to
bring them in separately  218.160490 so I want to
bring in just a blank face without the
eyes and mouth and things on it because
those are gonna be some times they'll be
closed  227.180466 or sometimes they'll be in a
different position  228.760742 so I want everything
that's going to be a you know I can't
you kind of to think through and think
how what parts am I gonna want to
animate and what parts are gonna stay
the same all the time  237.167880 and so then I just
go to file export and I just grab like
the shoe the calf the thigh 243.452058  I just grab
all these different parts name them and
export them as a PNG image 247.619660  and yeah
that's what I'm doing here that's really
all there is to it and like I said every
every individual thing I probably do
need to draw I can either redraw the
mouth here or I can redraw or modify
different mouth positions in the
animation software 263.807883  up
I do that in the software itself  266.043717 but I
could have redrawn them here too  268.355951 that's
the whole process appreciate you
