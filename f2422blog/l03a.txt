hi and welcome to my walkthrough in which I'm gonna show you how to build your very own game of candy crush
5.561416
this game is gonna be super simple
7.514500
I say super simple
8.528998
as we're not going to be focusing too much on styling
10.971018
this is a JavaScript walkthrough
12.761935
very much gonna be focusing on the logic of the game
16.093205
I am doing this so you can take the game start up
19.423497
as you want truly make it your own
21.389163
this game has a lot of potential
23.399100
especially with the drag and drop movements
25.724829
we're going to be doing
26.513767
so I'm excited to see
27.599183
what you guys come up with
28.884246
in this walkthrough I'm going to be showing you
30.918954
how to create a board randomly generate candies
34.404371
all over the board
35.314933
switch out colors of candies
36.762746
on the board
37.838746
drag and drop candies
39.459413
check for matches
41.000579
check for valid matches
42.879787
so check that the row of candies
45.170766
doesn't go off into the next row
46.710204
move all the candies down
48.122974
if you get a match
49.613787
and generate new candies
51.560745
by the end of this walkthrough
53.386329
you should have also got to grips with inbuilt JavaScript functions
57.227536
such as every sum for each includes
61.251578
set attribute and many more
63.101723
I would love to see your finished games
65.303578
so please do share them with me on youtube
67.421411
or Twitter my Twitter handle is Anja underscore Kubo
70.584015
or Instagram
71.455598
whatever
72.241015
okay
77.128703
so as always let's make sure our javascript file
79.462057
and style sheet are linked up properly
81.261619
using these script tag
82.348161
and link tag respectively
83.687848
if you have put the two files in the root of your folder
86.745786
make sure that reflects and the path you put in your tags
89.311681
if you are not sure what any of this
91.966515
means please do watch my video that I've linked as a card
94.642847
here I am putting my script tag in the header
97.919804
as I want to use a Dom event listener on my JavaScript file
100.577013
this is a choice that
101.941783
I'm making on my preference
103.121387
as opposed to putting the script tag in the footer
106.081074
now we need to go ahead and put a div tag here
109.993011
and give it a class of grid
111.824657
this div tag is where all the magic happens
115.168844
so let's give it the respect
116.746449
and deserves and style it up to look like an actual courage
119.706511
for this we flip over to our style sheet or CSS file
124.196032
now to pick out our div element
126.702844
that we gave a class name to
128.080886
we get the name we also put a dot in front of it
131.953719
this means class
133.155490
I have pre decided that
136.029948
when my grid to be made up of 8 by 8 squares
138.953906
I thought 70 pixels squares are nice
141.590302
so 70 x 8 that's 560 pixels
145.678531
let's give our grid a height of 560 pixels
150.015322
and a width of 560 pixels
152.236738
as I've done this many times
154.305862
I know that if we want to put divs inside the squared
156.969612
the divs will appear stacked over each other
158.813362
we used to make them snake over each other row by row
162.110173
so we need to do this by using at display flags
164.379714
and then flexwrap
166.250068
so that they break when they can't fit in the grid
169.291505
we have made and start a new row
171.452443
I'm also gonna give the grid a background color
174.498338
just so we can see what's happening in our browser
177.197484
let's go ahead
178.999484
so right click on HTML file to see this in our browser
181.997525
okay it cool a blue grid
184.376191
if you inspect the page
187.214253
you will see that information has been passed to our browser
190.197919
now let's our CSS file what we want our future squares to look like
194.528585
as we said I'm pre decided I want to be 70 by 70 pixels big
198.622605
so height 70 and width 70
202.149543
now let's create some squares go my grid
204.762605
using JavaScript
206.619939
you will see here I have already put in my Dom event listener as part of my boiler plate to set up
211.767314
I will now be writing all my JavaScript in this event listener
215.605501
for it to be picked up on my script tag
218.049709
which I placed in the header of my HTML
220.411459
as mentioned some people liked with a script tag on the footer of the HTML
223.905189
and skip the Dom event listener the choice is up to you
226.869439
this Dom event listener is essentially saying in laymen terms that I want all of my HTML file to be read
233.722168
before loading this javascript file
236.006043
and is a more foolproof way of making sure that these events happen in order
240.700834
now using an inbuilt method called a query selector
244.687667
I am telling my JavaScript file to look at my HTML file
248.086271
and find the element with the class name of grid
251.191063
indicated by this dot
252.769834
and save it as constant grid
255.315063
we are doing this we can reuse this line of code over and over again
259.851292
just by typing grid
261.224438
let's also tell our JavaScript file
263.232917
we want our width to be 8 from now on
265.459312
let's store that as a and as it won't change
268.283750
so the first thing we're going to do is show you how to create a board using javascript
273.521062
I will do this in a function
275.718292
I am choosing to call create board
278.164521
now using a for loop I want to imagine our future grinch
282.804396
we decided it was going to be 8 by 8 squares
285.214979
so let's use width x width to tell our JavaScript
289.155646
that this is the syntax for a for loop
292.576625
what we are doing here is looping over something 64 times
300.131582
incrementing by 1 each time from 0
303.040728
now every time it does loop over
306.589415
we want to create a div using an inbuilt method called create element
310.914477
we are creating a div element
313.051810
I'm going to call this square for our HTML file
320.171185
next we need to put that square into a div with a class of grid
327.294497
we do so using another input method called append child
331.197768
we do so by passing through the newly created square into a grid constant like this
336.964747
lastly each time we create a div
339.718934
and add it into a grid
341.168830
I also want to store it in an array for us to work with
344.520725
so let's create an empty array first called squares like this
348.513184
and now as well as put a square
351.451621
and their grid
352.371850
I also want to push that square into my array
355.075142
that I called squares
356.254183
we do that using an inbuilt method called push
358.958662
now that we have done all this
361.040724
let's see if it works by invoking the function like this
363.242579
so save the page
365.818433
go over to our browser
366.767308
and yep it has works
368.776766
if we inspect the page
370.456620
we can now see all our divs happily sitting in our garage
373.205515
ok let's flip back now
377.105494
I'm gonna start off by going an array of all the candy colors I'm gonna work with
381.098869
so I'm going to call those candy colors as they do not change
384.639077
I'm gonna put them in a constant
385.968223
so there we go red yellow orange purple and green
391.664098
now let's go back to our create board function
400.024806
instead of just creating the square after the square has been created
403.485138
I also want to give it a candy color
405.768367
I also wanted to be random
407.746242
to get a random number from our array
409.963575
we need three input methods
411.912783
we use math.random and multiply it by the arrays like this
416.389137
now we want to make sure the number we get back as a full integer
419.835283
for this we're going to use math.floor to round this number down to the nearest full number
425.852033
and there we go we now have a random number from zero to five
431.104095
we are starting at zero
433.622408
as Index start count at zero
435.831303
this is important so if you're not comfortable this yet
438.953428
please make sure a note to research into this later
441.940407
once we have a random number
445.378448
we want to pass that through our candy colors array to get a color
449.571303
and assignor to the square
450.935572
so let's get the square
453.313967
and using style background color like this
456.301238
we want to assign it to that random color here
