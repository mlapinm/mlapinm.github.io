 1.345072 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial  5.357723 in this lesson we're going to
learn the proper way to erase 9.276208  and a way
that we can a nice good way that we can
kind of merge shapes together 15.680942  and create
new interesting shapes  17.492094 without having to
freehand draw things 20.333557  so we see here this
remembered the last settings that we
were using  24.193423 so if we just select this
circle  25.864768 and double click on it and click
this full to complete a full circle  29.440816 and
then I mission to draw a rectangle 32.420785  and
will turn one of them red  33.720469 will keep the
other one blue  34.780524 and they both have a blue
stroke   but that's fine 37.676657  so what we want
to do suppose we want to make a shape
like this  42.688610 that had like a square  44.904753 we want
suppose we want the shape to look like
that  48.464839 the whole outline of this 49.552662  so maybe
we'll make it black let's make both
these black actually 53.624767  alright and then
forget about the stroke but it'll look
kind of like this  56.820570 well what we can do is
we can select both objects  60.804596 and we can go
up to path  62.512426 and we can go to this Union 64.768938 
and that will create a union 66.228798  we see it
gets rid of that blue line the overlap
line  68.505008 and now this is just one object
it's not a group  72.212779 if we hit ctrl shift G
nothing happens 74.884650  we can't break this
apart it's just kind of an object 78.012697  now we
can never get back 79.728663  this Square and this
circle separately this rectangle in
stand circle oval instead it's just this
thing like maybe this is a loaf of bread 87.880758 
and we can color it so it looks like a
loaf of bread  90.150571 that's a way that you can
kind of create some different things
maybe you want to create the Mickey
Mouse ears  95.745256 so we do this  97.749080 then we hit
ctrl D to duplicate it  100.257470 and then we draw
like an even bigger circle to connect
the to make our Mickey Mouse ears like
this 106.002129  but we'll turn them all like blue 108.958200 
so that's pretty cool 110.526675  oh hey that's
matching our stroke color so it looks
really good 112.837109 
so it looks good right now 114.035192  we could just
group ctrl G  115.804209 and now they're all grouped
together  116.922741 but it's different than this 119.266876 
and the reason it's different is if we
were to put a stroke on there 121.731123  you'd
still see those lines  123.442820 and sometimes you
want to have we we might want to do a
stroke on this 128.863017  in fact let's do let's do
it you know 131.434242  a nice
noticeable stroke  134.959717 and we want these
lines to be gone  138.595549 so we don't what we
don't do is take the erase tool  141.959703 and try
and erase those lines like this 144.367594  that's
just gonna not work even if it's
selected  147.669842 it's not going to be oh we're
on there I don't know if I would even
work ctrl shift G if we ungrouped it 153.203652  we
could try and do that  154.335449 so we take this
and now we try and erase it 156.907650 
it'll this is what it does creates all
kinds of craziness  160.707721 and if we turn off
the the fill even 163.211615  it's still not gonna
work the way we wanted to 165.075944  so control so
you control Z control Z  168.307482 what we want to
do is the same thing we did to make this
loaf of bread 170.923316  we select the whole thing 172.459405 
we go to path Union  175.239741 and now this becomes
its own path  178.027432 so it's no longer an object 179.903489 
we can't get in and edit the radius of
each individual circle we can't make the
pac-man anymore like we could before 186.256057  by
doing like this type thing  188.459747 so we can't
do that because this is an object  192.011598 oops
this thing is an object now  194.003872 and this is
a path  195.683913 but what we can do if we double
click we can see we can edit the
different nodes of this path  200.611538 we can kind
of change the arc  202.787627 but we had looking
pretty nice the way before is because
I'm just awesome at drawing Mickey Mouse
ears  207.907536 so now we've got a Mickey Mouse
here  209.743660 we've got a loaf of bread  210.871897 what if
though what if we want to well ok let's
create a bite mark out of this loaf of
bread  217.491792 this is a good example  218.807585 so what if
we want our bite to look kind of like
this 222.915821  let's select some circles  224.499647 let's
make it a full circle  225.812082 so it's not the
pac-man  226.995757 and doesn't matter what color it
is we'll just make it black  229.851721 let's zoom
in here and let's have a nice 231.723647  so let's
get maybe about this size with you one
day I'll have control D to duplicate 239.587660 
we'll do s another one and control D 242.159271 
that looks sort of like a bite mark 244.159563 
maybe we'll bring this one forward a
little bit more  247.991691 so we're trying to
create like that I look like there's
something been bitten out of here 250.843618  so
we'll keep it just like that 253.187632  we'll
select all of these 255.123797  I'm gonna hit
control D and just duplicate this whole
thing  258.447547 we might use it again  259.627715 let's select
all of these  260.651628 and go to path and then we
go to difference  263.327758 and now what it's done 265.563513 
hmm control-z let's say let's select
these three and and create a path out of
all of them a union I mean  273.248120 so it's Union
these just like we did the Mickey Mouse
ears  275.827652 and now let's make that our bite so
now we swept the bread by holding down
shift and selecting the bread  282.751612 and these
three Union circles  285.875678 and now we go to
difference  287.900128 and now we've got a nice
little bite mark out of there  290.139787 and see
that the stroke follows the bite mark
and it looks kind of like a bit of bites
been taken out of there  296.111504 if this doesn't
make sense at first  300.642526 that's completely
normal because this is not this is like
an absent an abstract way this is the
way that you work in Inkscape  307.060818 but it's
kind of counterintuitive to what you
might think to being used to with bitmap
editing where you just grab an eraser 313.612885 
and draw out an edit pixel by pixel 316.305710  and
the reason again that we do this in
Inkscape is because we can scale this
loaf of bread huge  322.297672  and it'll always keep
the same characteristics it'll never
ever get grainy  328.205813 so if we zoom in here 329.545602 
it's always just nice and sharp and it
never gets graining  332.685680 it's it looks really
cool  334.541924 all right so those are the two that
we looked at path  337.401565 we've got Union we've
got difference 338.613848  there's also intersection 340.803109 
intersections   like well what if we want
to keep just the part of the objects
that intersect with each other 348.021148  so I'm
gonna highlight these three circles and
delete them  350.465184 and let's say we want to
keep just the bottom half of a star  354.577503 as
it intersects with this loaf of bread 358.437169 
come on now I've got my you can turn
that off if it's bothering you 363.533414  you can
actually turn off this thing here  364.665285 that
says enable snapping  367.073270 and we'll just
disable snapping then that won't snap
any more  369.460867 with that enabled you see that
was like the corner of the star was
snapping to the top of the bread 375.661330  so if
that bothers you like it just did me we
can change that  379.145445 let's make this
intersection though and let's highlight
this whole thing  382.693382 

let's go to path
intersection  385.406918 so now what that's done is
just done the inside intersection you
can look and see  390.290767 and so it's cut off the
top of the star because that's where the
loaf of bread was intersecting it  394.743717 but
everything else is gone 396.203368 
so now it's like a little object
actually wasn't the best example let's
go back  400.911967 a better example for that one
would have been a path  403.727430 and let's do like
exclusion  406.211387 and so now we have just the
star excluded or actually even if we
drag it to the middle  411.235470 and we want it to
be yeah we go here  path exclusion 416.215617  so now
we have a loaf of bread with a star in
the middle of it  419.183502 but it's not like it's
not a white star  420.899560 it's a star cut out of
it  422.327960 so if we drag it over top of
something  424.380239 it's like a cut out  425.604282 just like
this this bite mark is a cut out  429.103399 only
it's behind if when I raise it we go to
the top level  432.099214 and then we can see it's
in front of there 433.739367  let's take but we're
done now we can't  438.639558 we can't grab this
star back out unless we do undo and hit
ctrl Z 442.391218  we're just done with all of these 443.487313 
we can't these are just paths now  445.455540 we can
go in and edit the nodes of them 447.803218  but we
can't ever go back and change the
properties of this star  452.447347 like we would
just by drawing a store we can't   do this 455.887546 
for example or we can't do this  to this
star  460.512113 because it's no longer an object
it's a path cut into this bread  464.375732 let's
draw one more let's draw another thing
to do an example 468.371724 
oops so one thing in fact with a star 472.171839 
though we'll just use this loaf of bread
that we already have controlled
duplicate  475.324330 I'll delete these circles I
just did 477.356619  let's take this star  478.564099 and see
it's behind we need to get up top  480.740056 so I
can push the page up key on my keyboard 482.760173 
or I could hit this button to raise the
top  484.890681 but let's create something kind of
like this 487.591915  and then what I'm gonna do  490.559735 is
hold down shift and select the bread and
the star at the same time  494.657863 and we'll go
to path  496.358250 and we'll do this will do is it
cut path yeah let's do cut path  506.310121 so that
was a set that'll make it so that we
have all these different parts of this
bread  513.028545 and they're each different paths 514.454071 
so everywhere that star was  516.010260 it's kind of
hard to to see you if we hit ctrl Z  519.438284 it
cut each of these paths into into
different points 522.358079  so now we have just
this path here  524.494310 we would probably do with
a star like that but if ever you want
that you have a path   like this  528.998247 and we
want to cut out just the top part of it 531.070205 
we can do that
cut path 534.122150  and if we do it like this if we
want just the top part of the bread 537.357976  we
go to path and we go to cut path 539.530089  and now
we have just this top part of the bread  
as its own separate path  543.626016 because
otherwise you know naturally you might
just think well  549.733927 let's why don't we just
edit the nodes and 552.153847  then you come in you
start deleting nodes like to get to that
top half and it just doesn't behave the
same way  557.913769 so this top half the bread is
now  560.129564 it's all connected and how do you
break apart 562.953983  so and there are multiple
ways to accomplish this  565.677813 but a good way
to get to have create shapes that you're
wanting to shape to create is gonna be
to use these different things 574.593412  division
exclusion intersection so play with
these  578.342375 and I should have mentioned this
earlier but a good cheat sheet for
everything that you've learned in these
tutorials  582.753557 and honestly like the way that
I've learned in scape is by using the
built-in tutorials  588.333879 so if you go to help
you go to tutorials  590.465741 I believe these ones
are under advanced maybe  593.781841 but it brings
up a new window and it shows you all
this stuff that we've been doing so you
scroll down and it has you know working
with text  603.161652 and somewhere on was it on
this one 605.658444  yeah so it has all the
different it shows an illustration of
what these different things do Union
difference intersection exclusion
division cut path 616.946278  and so you can
practice this the cool thing about this
tutorial 620.582566  the tutorial is built into
Inkscape is that you can actually click
and edit the every part of it even the
text 627.758375  it's really cool because the
tutorial is written on an Inkscape
canvas  631.602402 and so if we want to demonstrate
this union we just go to select both of
them  635.134480 go to path and then we go to Union
and now we have that same shape as this
hit ctrl Z and we can demonstrate each
one of these  643.358328 we can do difference  644.894673 we can
do this division  646.218398 we go to path division
and it creates the same looking thing
here  650.058535 it's like a puzzle piece  651.594565 so that's
really cool 654.506349  so anyway that's why you can
learn and reference a lot of what you've
learned is by going into these different
tutorials 660.410444  under the help and tutorials
section inning scape  663.706438 sorry I should have
mentioned that earlier that's like a
super
valuable resource I don't know why I
didn't just start  667.408576 start that  at the
tutorial one showing you that was there
but  671.585113 anyway hopefully you find that
useful and it opens a separate window
too 676.456670  so we can just close that close
without saving  679.332806 and then we have our old
one up here  680.596910 but practice get used to
those tools because you will use them 684.384882 
thanks for watching  685.600797 we'll see in the
next video 686.628793  686.628793  686.628793
