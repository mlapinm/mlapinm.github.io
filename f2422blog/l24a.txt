 1.599685 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial  5.592739 in this video we're going to be
looking at the rendering engine in
Inkscape  9.944991 and learning how to render
objects and shapes into Inkscape  14.040949 instead
of having to draw them in like we've
done in the past  17.111544 we draw a circle 18.412945  we can
draw different things well now we're
gonna zoom in here 21.208865  we're gonna render 22.376754  so
I'm gonna zoom in right to the middle of
the page here 24.765997  and we go to extensions 25.918554 
and we go down to render  28.210291 so we can
render all kinds of things 29.543208  we can render
like this first one 3d poly heat drawn 33.738333 
okay by default it's a cube which isn't
that amazing  37.594023 but we can get some really
interesting things like this great oh
boy dodecahedron  44.594310 all right we have some
different options for how we can stylize
it  47.846056 and change it 48.889941  we'll just leave
everything default here and hit apply 51.262082 
and then it will create  53.414012 it's behind here
for us so we've created this nice shape
which is like a much more advanced shape 57.758854 
and something we could draw over here  59.614810 we
see it has shading in it 62.653869  and yeah I
don't know if it's up at all yeah it's
all group so I hit ctrl shift G  67.062041 and I
ungrouped it  68.515930 and so now we have all
these different parts  70.239978 it's almost like a
puzzle  71.332016 and look there's even parts
behind that we couldn't even see 73.969020  it's
like a 3d object  75.369035 so a lot of cool stuff
you can do with this 77.841212 
but we're just going to move on and show
some other things we can render 82.336869  so
rendering basically just means 84.525216  we're
letting our computer create something
based on some usually advanced math 89.785047 
let's go to render this alphabet soup 92.053009 
lets us render text 94.020886  so we can click live
preview on a lot of these 96.261022  I don't know
where it's showing the text though 100.012883 
alright let's hit apply  101.033072 it must be up
top here  101.997459 yeah so it's created this this
text  105.190155 but it's actually a randomly
generated text  107.825055 and it's not the fonts
it's a path  111.128849 so we can edit and change
this path 113.369019  but it's sort of I haven't
found like a really good use for this
but  117.465035 every time it creates a different
type of fonts  120.120968 so if we do this if we get
to leave it all  122.368899 and we go to render
extensions render  125.068905 and we go to this
alphabet soup check live preview  131.032916 so we
can just change it if we change the
scale a little bit 133.948920 
it'll update it'll change the size of it
but also change you see the T changes 138.344961 
the just the style of the it's not
really a font 141.432914  but the way that its
drying it changes  143.820950 and we can do
randomized we can type in some other
letters here  147.292949 and I just gets kind of
crazy looking  149.307451 but that's that's bad
that's a zoom out here  154.147205 let's go to see
with render what else I want to show you 156.979528 
so a barcode I have another video I've
made just on showing barcodes and QR
codes  161.095219 but this just creates a bar like a
QR code that you can put on an app  165.043247 or on
a business card or on your website 167.495348  and
whatever Det data you type in here  169.747513 it
will create a barcode a QR code or you
can also do a traditional like a bar
code for a supermarket or like an ISBN
number on the back of a book  177.667312 you can do
that as well 179.103126 
you can render a complete calendar so
check this out we can change all the
different settings of this I'll just
leave it the same  185.215157 and so we have a nice
calendar here  187.231036 that we could print out
 188.351315 and we have a cool calendar 191.068588  and
everything if we ctrl shift G  and
ungroup  194.307191 I think this is all yeah so we
can actually get in and move individual
parts  199.176249 and we can probably even ungroup
this 200.371293  and move individual parts of this
around  203.003099 and so on and so forth  206.291174 yeah
control-z a couple times get rid of all
this  208.802982 let's see what else we can render
extensions render 217.175258  I want to show you
foldable box I'll just do this real
quick so a foldable box is a oh this is
way too big
zoom out but it creates a box  226.599053 that we
can fold 227.863055  so we could print this out and
it's just the instructions it has the
tabs here  234.691051 for how to fold this 236.367134 
yeah it's not gonna show up very well 240.135102 
but it's a foldable box we print this
out and then follow these lines 243.351434  and it
has a little you put glue and you can
fold and make a 3d cube out of paper 247.863085  and
there's lots of different settings for
different ways you can make that box
generate sizes and whatnot  254.066893 where we add
render grids is kind of nice if you want
to just render a grid for whatever
reason  262.031062 all kinds of different settings
but you could render a grid  264.646775 for maybe I
don't know 266.298948 
you might know if a purpose you could
use this for as your background grid
then you can still make it transparent 271.586710 
you can lock it issues as a grid to help
assist you while you're drying 275.510934  or you
can actually print out a grid if you
wanted to print make your own grid paper 278.646815 
or something like that 280.010742  render what else
do we have here Oh gear  284.674931 so we can
actually render like a gear we can
change 286.684431  we do a live preview 288.402493  we can
change like the number of teeth 290.730362  the gear
has  292.086434 we can make like a small little 293.854546 
little beer with some different teeth 296.818423 
then we can change a lot of it from
settings of  299.366589 yeah how that generates so
you can generate a gear  304.538259 what else we do
render  306.914569 I'm just trying to show you these 308.518420 
it's good like like with everything go
through and play with these 

311.522700  and get
familiar with what they what tools 313.006024  they
are that way when you're designing
something 315.454076  you might come up with an idea
for these  318.563655 a lot of these I'm not into 3d
printing yet 320.114219  but I think a lot of these
have applications in 3d printing  322.870614  and
vinyl cutting and things like that  325.434283  so
random tree is probably going to be
pretty cool for us  329.256086 so it's going to
create a tree 330.442367  we have initial size  331.709974 we
have our minimum size 333.186439  and so we can
create just a random looking like tree
thing  336.990147 so with this we hit apply and then
all of a sudden we have a nice little
tree branch 341.366411  and we can come and change
the stroke size 344.458272  and then if we just grab
like look 347.018472  we can grab three little
circles 348.662339  and we this is like the base of
our tree get rid of this  352.768328 stroke on here
and we've got a nice little tree apply
some gradients here  357.780257 and all of a sudden
we have a tree without having to go 359.728285  and
draw like our paths  separately  362.004259 what else
I think that's maybe just about
everything I want to show 367.532372  let's see I
look real quick rendering  369.352413 yeah
oh okay so charts too is kind of cool if
you have chart data on like libera
office or in a spreadsheet program  379.504330 on
your Google Drive somewhere you can
actually import that into here and you
can create like a bar chart 385.364123  or a pie
chart and then you can use all the tools
that Inkscape has to offer and you could
apply like gradients to your to your
chart data  394.740236 and do different things to
make it look awesome 397.224807  so you can stylize
really well so that's part of render
also 400.672236  is rendering in chart data  403.028350 play
with these 405.118654  take a look at them  406.218712 and I'll
catch you in the next video 409.750386  thanks for
watching   410.750021  410.750021  410.750021
