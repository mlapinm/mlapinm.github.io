 1.641102 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial 5.652662  in this video we're going to be
looking at using the freehand drawing
tool  9.876909 and I've told you in past videos
stay away from it
but I just want to show you some of the
different settings of it and if you are
gonna use it actually I show you kind of
some 18.822536  some things that can be nice with
it so  20.002538 I have my freehand tool selected 22.126664 
and this is gonna be a good precursor
into using the bezzie a tool 25.556387  which we'll
cover in the next video  27.250509 also in the past
video we talked about paths   and objects 31.774667 
in just the previous video before this 33.678768 
so if you haven't watched that one yet
go ahead and watch it it'll help this
make a little more sense  37.186407 so if we draw
anything with this sort of pencil tool
this freehand draw tool 42.306467  and then we go
to edit  the nodes of it by using this
tool here 46.696913  we see we've got all these
different nodes  49.270487 and that's because we
had our there's different settings for
this   when we do freehand drawing  55.722575 so by
default it's a very it records
everything we do and it creates it kind
of jagged  61.444811 so we could smooth this out 63.588789 
and what we do is we go to path since
this is a path and not an object 66.872676  we go
to path and then we just go to simplify 70.244223 
and what that's actually gonna do is
remove some of those nodes  73.379303 so now if we
go see there's not nearly as many nodes
as there were before  77.357823 we do the same
thing again you go to path simplify 80.347557  and
it gets rid of some of those nodes and
in the process 83.388215  it smoothes this out a
little bit so it's a little more smooth 86.370405 
another way we can do this is just when
we're drying  90.270278 and this is like a big
difference a lot of people think when
they first start using Inkscape  94.418256 they're
like well illustrator  95.482390 you know does
freehand drawing a lot cleaner  97.960465 but
that's because it's just a setting it's
at under smoothness  101.222240 and Inkscape can do
the same thing so you just turn the
smoothness up to like 50 105.746363  up here  107.310231 under
the settings when you have the freehand
tool selected  109.642200 and now if we draw some
squiggly lines it smoothes it out 112.826462  and we
can make this even more if we do like
yes 282 116.782259  this is gonna be like really
smooth 118.780290 
so it just kind of smoothes it it takes
what we drew  121.762351 and it doesn't do exactly
what we did  123.550280 and it gives it much less
nodes 126.526292  so now we only have one two three
four five six nodes  129.896747 which lets us have a
lot more control  132.584295 so if you're signing
your stick
mature and you have this down to the
default  137.412744 which is five
your signature is gonna look super super
ugly  141.454503 I think and if you go to edit it
you're gonna have a thousand nodes in
here to edit  147.402351 especially if you draw
slowly  149.025421 the slower you draw your
signature 152.409829  this look your the way more
nodes you're gonna get in there I see
look at this 157.608471  but if we turn the
smoothness up to even like turn to 95
which is just way higher than you
probably ever want to do  166.812481 and then we
draw like the letter A  168.864453 it just makes it
look nice and smooth  172.484604 right or look the
letter  174.768410 let's do it T
J yeah so that's just much smoother than
it would have looked if we had our
smoothness down to 5%  183.292435 or five because
with this it's like TJ and it's just a
lot more you can see the difference of
it right 189.653110  and you can really see the
difference when you go in to edit the
notes  193.353351 this one has basically 195.388840  this is two
nodes one two incredibly simple 200.676805  whereas
this one is no not so many but it's
still quite a bit it's like twenty
different nodes maybe 206.897701  these things are
quite you know a lot of different nodes
to create this arc  210.600444 whereas this one is
gonna be just two nodes that's it to
create the arc  214.896476 and that's we're gonna
learn more about in the next tutorial
with our Bezier tool 218.673668 
but these arcs are controlled you have
these handles here  221.991754 so you can control
the steepness of this arc you pull this
handle out  225.995616 or you can control the angle
of it 228.748772  and control the shape that way 229.927949 
anyway let's get into our Bezier tool in
the next video  235.210321 but that's how you can
use the freehand tool  if you want to
just use this smoothness  239.114863 that's gonna
help things out a lot  240.646820 or if ever you
have a really complicated thing like
this J here and you want to smooth it
out  246.290793 you can go to path and then go to
simplify  249.738718 and you can do that a couple
times paths simplify just keep doing
that a few times  254.630826 and eventually you'll
have a really much simpler 257.314489  you'll just
remove the amount of nodes you have 260.199045  and
create a simpler object  262.310772 that you can
edit much easier  263.738759 than having to go in
and edit every single 266.734828 
you have too many nodes  268.622847 and I guess I'll
show you this too you can actually
select multiple nodes  271.890709 so if we select
just these bottom ones 273.746893  then we can move
these bottom ones independent of the
rest of the nodes 276.717969  you can select
multiple nodes and delete them if I
select those three  280.600441 I hit the Delete key
you'll just delete those nodes 282.956334  so that's
just sort of you know touching on
getting started editing nodes  287.956063 and again
these are this is only with paths if you
go to draw like a rectangle  293.240322 and you want
to edit the nodes of it you can't
because it's an object and not a path  298.819544 so
to do that like we learned in our last
video and go to path object to path 302.599844  then
you can edit individual nodes 304.467561  and you
can add in nodes by double clicking you
can add another node in there 308.977902  and create
a kind of a cool shape right  311.939426 and you can
actually click and just create an arc if
you click and drag you can bend a part
of the shape  318.211525 and kind of start to create
really cool-looking things  322.471447 so join me in
the next video where we'll talk about
and be demonstrating using the Bezier
tool  328.538190 go ahead and feel free to ask
questions comment below get involved the
discussion 332.486145  and I'll see you on the next
video 334.470063  336.478007  338.973821
