 1.729808 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial  5.230174 in this video we'll be using
the board games counter sheet extension
to create some cards 12.575817  and I'll show you
just how to use this extension so we
installed it in the last video  16.621676 and this
is actually cards SVG it's an example
file that comes with the with this
extension  25.363189 and so we see we have three
different cards here they're all grouped
together 28.431481  and I'm just going to
demonstrate how this works so if we zoom
out we see here's our page 31.823204  and these
cards are each just a template  34.179040 and so
the way the extension works we click on
extension  37.202915 extensions here go to board
games and create countr sheet  40.082759 and it has
all these different options  41.775205 so the name
is really important right now but what
is very important is where the data file
is  47.178412 so we want to create a number of
cards based off of the information found
in this file this counter sheet dot CSV
or whatever whatever it's called 57.368119  and so
ours is actually going to be called
cards dot CSV because it corresponds
with the cards SVG  65.966294 and so the we can
find this too it's an example so 69.326616  the way
we the place we find it if we go to the
game folder that we created in the last
video  73.845987 and remember we moved over the
examples 76.218443  which is these are the same
examples that Kant got downloaded from
github with this this extension that we
installed  84.494254 so it has all these different
ones and one of them is cards here so
this is the cards SVG file that I have
opened up here  90.398506 but the other one is this
cards dot CSV which I also have opened
up in liber office 96.878474  and what it has is
three different columns telling about
different cards the text of the card the
title of the card and the type of card 104.010355 
so the title would be this part here
that says replace or title and then the
text would be the text inside 112.196285  so we need
to put the location of this 116.650390  the location
which is my desktop  118.710322 we need to put the
location of this cards dot CSV file here
in Inkscape where it says data file 126.771111  and
it has to be an absolute path  129.562234 so if we
just say cards SVG SVG and go apply  133.107251 it's
going to come up with an
and say we don't you know unable to find
that file where is it 137.720917  so we need to give
the absolute file path so to find out
where the path is 141.585997 
and that's why I put it in them to close
a couple of these that's why I put it
directly on my desktop  147.147113 and just named it
game  148.691925 so that it's not too hard to type
out 151.598899  so to find it to find out the
absolute directory of this we just go
right click  156.399146 and go to properties  157.895082 and
then the location is under see users for
me it's called del Optus the name of my
computer and then desktop game examples 167.111239 
so I'm just gonna copy this whole thing
left click and highlight it and go copy 171.187272 
and that's just the that's just the
examples directory that's just the
location of basically this 176.707390  but inside
here it's also going to be called cards 180.011232 
so we'll come in here and we'll just
right-click highlight all of this and
the erase it and then right click and go
paste  186.603015 so now we have an absolute file
path see users del opt desktop game
examples  193.018919 and I'll do one more backslash 196.159011 
and we'll type in or set a forward slash 199.503158 
and we'll type in cards dot c SB 203.339125  so now
if we go apply it's going to run through
we didn't change anything else the only
thing we've changed so far is this data
file CSV  211.166958 so it goes through works and it
creates some nice custom cards for us
over here that we can look at and see 217.727817  so
this says image three two images both
image image two and if we pull up our
spreadsheet  225.135189 we're going to notice we're
gonna see some of these same things 227.475129 
we've got both images down here image
three image two and then the same
information that's being put in there 235.341258 
it's calling a little PNG this.g four to
seven four dot PNG is being called  241.337176 and
so that's this little these little
images here if like a little mouse
rabbit and then we have these little
images here  249.161030 so do you see what's
happening it's kind of calling in this 253.093440 
and so if we close out of this and now
we have these different cards 256.765046  we can see
we can change them there it's all
grouped oh 259.897076  and what it actually did was
like layered because it did there's a
lot of information in this spreadsheet
so it actually created every line here
is a 267.725274 
and so we can find these cards are just
like layered on top of each other 272.137022  they
just did them all  273.609374 and so we can go
through and find all these different
cards and line them up and so it
arranged them in a nice printable sheet
for us  280.169034 and now we have all these cards
and their group if you want to change it
we can go ctrl shift G  284.422613 and ungroup it
was ctrl shift G  287.605231 and under and then we
can ungroup and move around different
elements of the card  290.981279 wow this is getting
this is super messy  293.697028 it's kind of a hard
extension to explain it's not super 298.376868 
there's not as smooth as if it was just
integrated into Inkscape directly 302.305006 
because we have to use this external CSV
file 305.637679  but the nice thing is it's very
extensible so you can create your own
templates too and not have to go off of
these examples 311.472196  let's do another example
though just to kind of drive this home
so I'm going to close this  315.665932 close without
saving  317.293876 I'll go back into here  318.657861 and I'm
gonna go to examples and instead of
cards this time  321.961798 there's one called dice
fold  324.181742 so let's open up dice fold and see
what this looks like 327.205909 
we have our dice fold  329.501735 which looks like
this so far so it just has like what you
would cut out to fold into a paper die 337.925815 
and then if we run our extension with it 340.862074 
we go to extension board games create
counter sheet  344.538095 and now it remembers which
is super nice it remembers of location 348.710105 
so we just go to the end here but it's
looking for card CSV but the
corresponding CSV file for this dice
fold is actually going to be this dice
full dot CSV  360.317644 so we'll open it up in in
the liver office  363.617576 and it only has a
couple different things  365.869730 it just has
basically images one two three four five
six images  370.040561 one for every face of the die 373.445420 
and so what we'll do with this is just
make sure we type in dice fold 378.520766  the IC e
fol d dot csv has to be exactly spelled
the same way as the as the data file  387.065575 so
when we click apply it's going to look
for that data file  390.053843 it's gonna look at
every all the information with it and 393.641498 
see if it can find corresponding images
to put on the those the faces of this
die so 400.449658 
why it found all the images and mapped
them 404.506402  to there so now we could print this
out  405.893735 and fold and we have a we roll to
see a character space  409.890005 but we can go in
and change  411.769804 so all of those clothes so
those images are all here 416.565437  we can see
each one of these 419.213821  if we open it up this
is an image and we can actually see
these images and edit them  424.029580 and/or change
them so if we wanted to die to actually
be like a conventional like a number
fancy looking five or something we can
edit this  431.725518 or just add a new image and
then change the name of the image here
in the data file  437.370320 so that making sense
should we do one more to kind of
illustrate what's happening let's close
this 443.629590 
let's go back into the examples 445.865650  well
okay a good one let's open up this
templates  448.697868 so under template there's a
really cool one prototype cards 452.049541  so we go
here we open up so this is going to look
at all these different types of cards we
have here  457.342738 and then if this is the data
the CSV file let's minimize this let's
open up the prototype cards SVG file the
Inkscape file  468.710008 and see what it looks like 470.057584 
so we see our page is over here to the
right  473.641689 and then we have all these
different types of cards  475.637479 it we have a
card with four images on 479.933538  it do we have a
card with two images on it do we have a
card with an image and some text below 483.817514 
we have a title card with a bunch of
different lines of information 487.781444  we have
this another card or a line card we have
a title card here that has just a bunch
of information on it 493.609569  and so we have one
with little pictures and stuff to the
side so these are just different formats
and we can move all these around 500.457443  so we
could actually move this parts of this
around now the image will be here on the
template every one of these is a
template  508.840817 and so they're kind of grouped
together but if we ungroup them we can
change we can create any kind of
template we want for any kind of card we
want 515.436865  so let's create the cards now we go
to extension  519.360858 and we have to have the
file open if we just go to new like if
we open up a new Inkscape file  and go to
extensions  526.581497 and try to recreate what we
did last time with the dice even though 530.164928 
this is looking for the dice fold CSV if
we try to apply it 534.434504 
it's gonna fail because we're just
opening a blank document  539.971550 and it doesn't
know where that dice we have to actually
open the dice SVG and then run the
extension while that SVG is open 548.908955  so this
one since this is open 550.404874  the card we're
gonna look for is the the file we're
going to look for is this one 555.000773  prototype
under scorecards under Scott underscore
all dot CSV 560.748891 so we go to extensions board
game create counter sheet  564.937067 and then we
just change the name of it  567.352795 so this is
not the dice fold because it doesn't
have the correct information for dice
fold 571.912930  its the proto type underscore cards
and that's where it comes in like to not
have a super long name 579.936957  and then all dot
sv dot CSV is what it was going to be 584.892397  so
we hit apply 586.076172  oh it couldn't find it oh
that's because it's not under examples 589.768459 
this one is actually in a different fold
that remember there's examples and
templates  593.696595 this is actually in the
templates directory  595.680299 so it would change
this instead of this part being called
examples 598.524205  it's gonna be called TEM PLA
tes templates apply  603.672325 and this should work 605.352369 
so something was wrong here  608.428242 oh because i
ungroup this to show you  612.305165 so we need to
regroup this  613.956683 control G you won't have to
do that unless you ungrouped it to I I
was showing you an example and I messed
it up I think now will apply and it
should work  622.844992 so everything has to be in a
group -  625.028873 in order for it to render
properly  627.044347 okay so I actually made some
changes I was having trouble rendering
so I actually modified the CSV file to
just render just these two types of
cards 634.453011  because there was something
causing trouble I don't have time to go
through and figure out what it was but
now if we hit apply 640.009122  you'll just go
through and just render those first two
types of cards  643.665056 and so we see we have the
cards here  645.782969 and and then we can move and
see  649.138950 and so this is just a couple and one
thing I wanted to show -  652.595914 if we change
this we can change the like this out set
distance to like 15 658.048975  oh and then we got
to go control-z and undo this  660.825183 and then
reapply 662.301208  and then that'll just change
sort of this cut line  665.573290 that out set
around so now this is a little bit
fifteen you might not notice the
difference 670.209266  you can also just go we can
actually click this live preview button 674.329315 
then it'll show it then if we make
changes here 677.417403  like changes 15 to 150 680.341422  and
then I'll have just a much larger outset
just thinking about it 684.429265  and now it's like
basically  686.021199 yeah a hundred and fifty
pixels or millimeters  689.373243 for the outset of
that  691.741286 one more thing I want to show you
that I just thought of before I end this
video if we go back into examples and go
to this cards example again  699.841314 so this one
if you remember correctly let's close
this or if we go back into this cards 705.681246  we
see that it has it had quite a few cards
here right I had them  709.737258 I don't know how
many different cards that are here 711.765620  but
if we want to do this one we go to
extensions board games  715.673353 we have to go
back into examples and change this to
cards  719.837309 and then we go apply so remember
it was layered layering those cards on
top of each other so I had all four of
them had just four 730.397373  first of all we can
change the size of the cards  733.969306 so if we
just select this and  735.837477 we are left select
all of them  738.257304 and we just scale them down
like that small  742.437208 whoops and I guess
what's delete all this now we go apply 746.685528 
now the cards will all be that size  748.861117 oh I
gotta undo it do a different way  751.081151 okay
now it'll work  753.169031 so now we take this 754.349152  we
scale them all down here 756.015747  now we hit
apply  757.526655 it'll show these cards very small
and it will just have all of them on one
sheet  760.897332 so now we have all of our cards
right here  764.341379 that on one single printed
page  766.221175 so to change the size of the card
you actually change the size of the
template or at least that's one way to
do  it  771.409153 and if we make it really large 773.733065 
again you have to control Z and undo
that 776.101326  you can't apply twice so that was
the problem  778.773304 so if we do make it really
big and then go apply  781.977136 it'll just go
based off of this size of the card  785.141234 and
so now we're all gonna have like one
card per sheet or something  788.893399 yeah because
it calculates the size of our page and
make sure that we don't put too many
cards on  794.053274 so now that these are all
stacked on top of each other  796.145117 well for
printing  798.361295 let's get rid of all that  799.973314 lets
me
this bet kind of to the size it was
maybe like this 804.237375  so if we're printing if
we check this or if we put in a
directory here 808.721188  copy and we go to PDF
output  811.717118 we can actually put it into this
just this game directory 816.401192  and now if we
hit if we go look at that game directory
real quick we just go back to game
there's nothing in here 822.181350  but if we hit
apply now it will actually create a PDF
file for every printable page of this  830.771116 so
we see it's working right now we've got
two three PDFs for 836.073027  and so it's gonna
actually create we've got four different
sheets here and if we open them up we
see each sheet contains different cards 
that we can print 844.688579   so that's a nice
option to if if we're ready to print and
you don't want to just like render the
two Inkscape  850.204126 you can actually render a
printable PDF page  853.292119 then you just send
all of these pages to your game producer
or the print shop that's printing your
cards  859.856256 and they'll just print them off
cut them box them up  862.221073 and yeah that is it
so that's just a little quick
introduction to using this counter sheet 869.678995 
hopefully that's enough to kind of get
you interested in it  872.755190 again it's open
source software so just play around with
it figure it out 877.355174  you can dive in and
make some changes to the code if you
have that you that ability 881.039248  but really
really useful stuff oh 884.527017  okay I guess
let's do one more thing this video is
kind of long but if you're curious about
how this works  889.879709 if we go take your
template and then go ctrl shift G  895.247343 and so
we'll actually right-click and go to
object properties  899.758126 and so the object of
this card like what it's called is
actually the ID is DVD that's a bad
example because that's not 907.731159  that's not
one of the real ones  909.143425 let's take this one
ctrl shift G  911.616076 and then click on the
actual the largest  914.468151 or which one is it 915.623987 
hold down alt and then click until you
find the right one  918.592213 so this one's called
our card  921.075963 and so if we go to our thing
here we find our card  925.356390 this is the old
one here we have card we have eye card
so the other ones called eye card 931.047322   I
guess maybe there's not an example using
the our card  933.503189 but basically this card
and this eye card is gonna correspond
with the ID of these right tier 941.679314  so this
one is the eye car so this I card here 944.727432 
this is eye card and it corresponds with
eye card here 948.151521  and so if we call this eye
card five 952.843272  it won't be able to find it
because it actually looks this first
column is looking for the ID of the
object here  961.467267 that make sense  964.739410 so you can
create your own templates that way as
long as you name your object  969.375363 something
that is mapped to here maybe I'll make
another video showing how to create
custom templates  975.307532 and using some of this
more custom stuff  977.518832 but for now I think
I'll end this video so I hope you found
that informative actually in the
immediate video  982.875448 I think I'm gonna do
there's another extension for creating a
grid map by the same developer 988.451487  so if you
want to create like a grid of squares
for like an actual board game 992.075539  I'll show
you how to do that 993.431146  and it's also going
to be a board game extension so they'll
be another option here to do that 997.647256  I'll
show you how to install that and get
using that as well  1000.059204 thanks for watching
go ahead  and like comment subscribe and
I'll see you in next video 1003.603377  1003.603377  1003.603377
