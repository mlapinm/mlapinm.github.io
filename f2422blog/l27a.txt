 1.857023 hey guys welcome back to this Inkscape
tutorial series  7.359733 I'm nearing the end of
what I feel like I can teach you I think
that in the future videos  11.938826 I'm just gonna
do with some application-specific
videos teaching you how to create a
certain like a logo or a certain product 18.984950 
but in this video I want to show some of
the things that we've created in the
past my wife and I using Inkscape 24.000709  so
this is actually a book cover this is
the front of the book  27.038108 and the back of a
book that my wife created for a
nonprofit organization that she's
working on called humanity books 33.657497  and I'm
just gonna show some video footage of
some of the real world objects like
these that she's created using Inkscape 41.886881 
really cool stuff 45.153700  and so I just want to
show that you can actually make some
pretty awesome things using Inkscape 48.540530  and
it's not just in theory it's not just
for like web design you can create
really professional-looking end results 54.444686 
here's another shirt that she made this
is the the source file for it 60.465917 
so these fonts I actually don't have the
correct fonts installed because these
were designed on Linux  65.165029 and then I think
she has some special fonts that she used
anyway 69.196405  but this shirt turned out really
well and this is just a screen printing
shirt  74.642936 and then in my business I've
actually used this is this sort the
original file I used when trying to
figure out the logo  82.734339 so these are some of
the different design choices I went I
kind of went through to try and arrive
at my final design  90.200664 and you can kind of
see how it came together  93.564259 and then I got
like just some samples of putting our
logo on t-shirts 98.684201  and bald cap so I using
scape a lot in in branding of my own
business  103.388134  and kind of seeing what it all
what these different logos will look
like you know on vehicles and different
things like that  109.436924 but this is the source
file and I've and I've embroidered this
on jackets and shirts and business cards
and done a lot of things like that  118.562156 so
yeah that's all I wanted to show it show
just a couple of the real-world things
that we've created using Inkscape 125.784770  and
hopefully this kind of piques your
interest and inspires you for the ways
that you can use Inkscape as well 130.629908
