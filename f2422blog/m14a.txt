 1.932112 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial 5.448652  in this video we're going to be
using the spray tool 8.870396  to create multiple
objects and copies of objects on the
screen without having to draw each one
individually 15.381687  so we're gonna be drawing a
starry night scene 17.753860  yes I'll show how
we'll do that first of all 21.929883  let's just
play with this spray tool for a second
and show you what it 25.190135  does if we just
click on it first on a blank canvas it
does nothing 27.762149  because what this actually
does is copy an object so if we draw a
circle 31.464273  we have a black circle like this 33.555752 
and then while it's selected we select
the spray tool 37.437320  now this is the object
that we're going to be spraying  40.027620 and by
default your settings might look a
little more 44.867493  I've changed some of these
settings a little bit but by default it
kind of looks like this when you spray 51.360388 
so what this did was actually drew a
whole bunch of of copies of this  56.620197 and I
have my scale turned on 59.216210  so they're all a
little bit different sizes 60.944082  but you can
make them spray the same copy  62.708487 let's grab
a better example might be let's do like
let's do something with a border so we
have red with a blue border 71.718604  and if we
spray this  73.434737 it look like this 74.679606  so we've
sprayed oh I have my rotation on to
which isn't on by default  78.254511 so these are
all rotated to 79.391239  do so that's what the
spray does it just sprays a bunch of
copies  but every one of these is its own
object that we can move and manipulate
separately  89.005636 alright I mean it controls
you a whole bunch of times you get rid
of all of this  93.761388 and let's do us so what
we can do is if we do a star for example 99.117728 
we can actually make like a starry night
scene 101.994645  so we'll draw a really cool
looking star 104.374718  and then we'll just spray
it to create a starry night scene  108.018605 but to
do that we're gonna change some of the
settings one of the settings we want to
do is come up here 111.238543  and click on prevent
overlapping objects  115.162556 if I hit control Z
now the stars won't overlap with each
other  119.206724 so that's kind of that's a lot
better  122.433733 and then also we can change like
the rotation 124.577068  if your rotation is set to
zero  126.853263 then they'll just all they won't be
rotated they'll all be like this 130.805157  and if
your
if your scale is set to zero 135.741211  then
they'll all just be the same size  138.885263 which
for certain things you might want to do
that if you're doing like an American
flag maybe you should want to do that
too and then you can go in and like
reposition these in fact we could use a
line and distribute like we learned in
the last video  151.257497 to light them up I
control Z a couple times 156.094625  but we're going
to be doing a starry night scene so
we're gonna left click here we'll just
cover a rectangle on our whole page  165.362512 and
then we'll turn it black and I'll get
rid of this stroke by just holding down
the shift key and going to this little X
in the corner to say no stroke  174.886601 all right
then we'll take this star and we'll just
use this one it's on a lower level so we
have to push the page up  181.935022 key to get it
to go up and let's turn it maybe we'll
turn it 185.387556 
let's do white we'll just do white star 191.930763 
and then we'll also turn off the stroke
for it so hold down the shift key and
click here  196.996046 on the no what's this called
none all right and then we will let's
scale this a little bit 204.594558  so I'm gonna
hold down the control key and scale it
uniformly down to about that size
perfect  210.731363 and now this while this is
selected I'll click on my spray tool 215.346475  and
let's take the rotation up -  218.549437 it doesn't
really anywhere above 50% will be good
for us  222.658557 and our scale this just shows the
that how large it will be so if we do
this a hundred percent we'll have some
pretty large stars and some pretty tiny
ones 231.514378  so we'll scale maybe two we want
them roughly to be about that size so
I'll Scout to about 51%  237.082116 let's just try
this and see how it looks awesome 241.625455  this
is maybe too many stars  244.042246 and what we can
do then we can select like well we want
sort of everything so we go select all
of it  253.101856 then we hold down the shift key
and deselect the background if we can
there we go  257.055867 its let's deselect it now
because you can see  259.423874 this it's not
doesn't have a white dotted line around
it if I hold down the shift key and
select it now the background selected  265.503867 if
I deselect it it's not 266.995814 
and then we can apply changes to all
these stars at once 270.191074 
in fact let's group them ctrl G now
they're all grouped and now we can
change the color if we wanted to have
all of them together  278.475868 we could maybe go
in and what I was thinking about maybe
doing was going in to fill and Stroke 285.292914  on
this object fill and Stroke 289.003931  and then we
could I don't know what we can do with
them we can change we can try and do
like see what it looks like if we blur
them a little bit  296.579875 and then maybe we
could apply  300.783151 I don't change your color
just a little bit  a little bit just like
the yellow 309.575745  yeah so anyway I then I
didn't have a real direction for
something to produce so by the end of
this video  317.191933 but I wanted to demonstrate
using the spray tool so that's one thing
you can use the spray tool 321.047982  for and again
you can also also you can draw its
whatever selected 327.424083  so if we went and got
grabbed our Bezier tool  329.976041 or even yeah if
we grab our Bezier tool  and create a
little something we can spray this now
and  337.795935 so we can grab our spray tool with
this selected 340.758557  if we turn our rotation
down to zero our scale to zero so it
won't rotate and scale when we're drying
it  347.635908 and then we turn our oh and scatter
down to 0-2 that'll keep it keep it
always in the same place  358.731761 and then if we
say let it overlap order I think I'll
and then we'll just spray that 369.439783  so then
we're getting like this we're spraying
this object  374.067830 that we did or every time we
click it a loss of your spray once yeah
that's how the spray Tool Works in
Inkscape  381.988084 appreciate you watching catch
you on the next video 384.815840  384.815840  384.815840
