 1.712438  welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial  7.708604 in this video I'll show you how
to install a custom extension to
Inkscape 11.952971  the extension I'm gonna be
installing is here on github it's this
counter   Sheetz extension 16.501325  and what it
lets you do is create card games on my
tabletop board games 21.752918  it's just a really
great extension to Inkscape 26.717498  and so this
is written and developed by paila
Nelson I think that's how you say it and 31.139563 
so huge shout out to him for doing this
that's kind of the beauty of open source
right is that anyone can write
extensions  37.558879 so if you have a niche you
want to use Inkscape to do some kind of
a crazy thing that it can't do yet 42.173975  you
can actually write your own extension 45.489304 
and then have that added functionality 48.297470 
so I'll show us how I'll show you how to
get that in here when we're done with
this video  51.481157 we'll have a new option
between a range and color called board
games 55.019207  that we can go to to create cards
and things very quickly with a nice
printable sheet of cards  62.998982 so once you
have that installed you can go ahead and
watch the next video where 65.785990  I will
actually demonstrate how to use this
extension  68.306606 but in this video it's just
kind of a boring one just how to install
the extension okay  72.529744 so the first thing we
need to do is download it  75.122075 so we'll go
here to this github page  and we'll just
click on this green download button  79.786999 and
go to download zip  81.555096 and so we'll download
this 83.735147  and then that's a zipped file so we
can navigate to it it's in my downloads
folder  87.927853 and actually have it already
extracted but if you don't have it
extracted yet 92.023258  it's called counter sheet
extension - master and you just go to
right click on it  96.606999 and then go to I'm
using 7-zip but you can just go to
extract here  101.163819 or to go to 7-zip extract
here I already have it extracted so I've
already done that but 105.287082  essentially we
need to extract it so it's not all
compressed and so that we can get to the
files individually  110.563047 and then this is what
the files will look like so I'm gonna
open this up so the only files we really
need from here  117.727158 are this counter sheet
INX 119.692013 
and this counter sheet dot pi py 122.027264  that's
a Python file so this is a this is
written in for Python which is what I
guess maybe I'll escape  129.814976 extensions are
written in that  131.435055 so to find out where to
put it and to find out which files when
actually we can just go back here to the
github where we downloaded it from 137.499054  and
it'll tell us on installation it says
copy counter sheet PI  141.970924 and counter sheet
INX to where Inkscape looks for
extensions on mac and linux it's going
to be in the dot config slash Inkscape
slash extension  151.090942 and on windows which is
what i'm using is going to be in Program
Files
Inkscape share extensions  156.683985 so we're gonna
go to see my local disk C and then go to
Program Files not the Program Files x86 162.519060 
actually I guess it depends on what
installation you're using but one of
those two will have an Inkscape
directory  167.595011 so go to Inkscape and then go
to share and then go to extensions 172.250920  so
here's all the extensions we have
already  175.166986 so if we notice of these
correlate with these extensions here we
have like a range and color and some
different things 180.650921  well those are going to
be the same things that we find
corresponding in our extension  we have
this color brighter  186.187155 you know color
darker color a grayscale 190.183797   and so we just
need to add in we need to pull up this
these extensions that we just downloaded 194.980365 
or this extension that we downloaded and
move it to here 198.151134  so here's the ones we
downloaded we're going to left click and
highlight both of these right click and
go to copy or we could just drag and
drop actually  204.895578 left click and drag  206.410987 drag
them over to here and then it'll come up
and say you need administrator
permissions to do this just click
continue it should ask us twice for one
for each file  214.934980 and now they are here
essentially its installed we need to
close out of Inkscape 220.522889  and then open it
up again 221.919079 
and then we will have a new option  226.191845 so
this is open we go to our extensions and
now we have boardgames here   create
counter sheet  232.255227 which was not here before
so we just added a custom extension when
we go to this it had bring up some
options for it  237.896234  and so I will show you
how to do this in the next video  240.734901 well
first of all I'll show you how to get
all set up though 242.838272  so what we're gonna
want to do is take the rest of these
that we can close out of this one now
where we installed  247.342854 that where our
extensions are 249.838032  but the thing that we
downloaded if we go back to our
downloads and go to this counter sheets 253.778047 
that we move the two files out but then
there's also some examples  257.802074 and some
templates 259.482194  so I'm going to keep those I'm
going to create a new folder on my
desktop  262.750043 and I'm gonna call it game 266.502068 
I'm gonna call it something very simple
and you should too 268.941974  and then I'm gonna
drag and drop the templates into there 271.346083 
I'm gonna drag and drop the examples
into there  273.678070 and the rest of these things
we can just leave 275.821897  so now when I go into
game I have the examples and the
templates directories which have a bunch
of some Inkscape folders  281.994898 and some like
some spreadsheets things that we can
open up in like libera office couch 289.286079  291.225878  291.225878
