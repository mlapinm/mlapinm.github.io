1.346003 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial  5.066593 in this video I want to talk a
little bit more deeply about exporting
your artwork 9.610445  and some considerations for
if you're creating artwork for print
design or for web design 16.061515  and some of the
different ways you'd go about exporting
that 18.665893  I had a comment on the YouTube
channel from Jim Carnegie 23.602818  and he was
asking about how to create a nice
smaller file size for uploading to web
pages  29.328364 and so we're gonna talk a little
about that to Jim 32.500361  and so first if we got
a file and go to export PNG  we know what
brings up this dialog here 38.339940  and I also
had another comment there was a lady
asking about this  42.169733 and because if you go
to if you dock it over here  46.357267 you click
this little icon  47.517264 icon if I this dock 48.997668  and
then if we go to file export PNG it
doesn't show up  52.397274 so just be aware and
that's not only with the export tool
it's with any tool our fill and stroke
are align and distribute when we dock if
I something  60.941485 it just appears on this
little dock here and it can be kind of
confusing  63.957309 but that's how we get it to
open if it's already open  66.172533 and again if
it's not open we go to file export PNG
image  69.745483 okay so the settings for how we
export our image or over here 73.008532  we have
our export area if we set up the page it
works off of this black page outline 78.694863 
which isn't shown in our final file  81.139053 but
it's gonna export and this one happens
to be like I think it's 1024 pixels by
1024 pixels  86.202573 and so the actual image
that'll get exported is gonna be this
981 by 981 at 92 dpi 92.902721  so what's going to
affect our file size is going to be the
width and the height and then also this
dpi dots per inch 101.440513 
doesn't matter what units were working
in in fact if we change this to
millimeters change it to centimeters or
pixels it doesn't really matter  108.699217 because
this is always going to be in pixels our
image size our dpi is always pixels and
our width and height there's always in
pixels  116.247306 if we click on drawing this is
going to export whatever is drawn
whether it's within or outside of the
page  123.763325 I push the minus key to zoom out a
little bit  126.542275 I can draw some stars over
here  128.547756 and now when we go to export  130.405644 so if
we export the drawing it's gonna take
every
that's drawn  134.544057 even if there's a
teeny-tiny little star out here  137.115889 and if
we go to export drawing we see our size
now is massive 140.128707  it's four thousand pixels
by four thousand pixels 144.338364  so this is gonna
save to my desktop  146.535403 and it's gonna be
called P PNG I'll hit export  149.421742 and now
that appears over here 151.209608  and we see it's
kind of large  152.581541 it's a little more that's
like a then it's like a third of a
megabyte it's three hundred and
sixty-four kilobytes 158.633746  and we can open
that up and see it's sure enough exports
the penguin down here with all the stars 163.161727 
and this last star here  165.377738 so it'll export
whatever the limits of our drying are 169.385792  as
opposed to page if week this click page
and now we keep everything the same and
hit export 173.822280  and replace 174.855270  well now this is
what it looks like our final image is
like this and it's about half the size 180.509165 
it's a hundred and eighty one kilobytes 182.342117 
because we export just the page 184.147971  even
though look our star over here is
selected  187.400601 we have our star selected 189.836135  but
if we go to export  191.963984 it's going to still
export   193.392409  just this picture of the penguin
that's because it's exporting the page
not the selection  199.524735 if we want to export
that just this star we click on the
selection  203.308658 and it'll export the star 204.972741  now
if I just leave everything the same well
looks like it changed our path  207.976285 so I
might need to go in here and just make
sure that  210.668863   I'm receiving over top of this 212.680645 
and click replace  213.877002 now it's the star and
that star is only twenty point six
kilobytes  218.232820 even though it was roughly I
think it's about roughly the same size
as the penguin  222.012962 see it's a lot smaller
because it just has a lot less detail 225.604701 
and not as many gradients not as many
nodes and different points there  230.228705 and so
that's not to remember to your file size
is gonna depend on how complex your
thing is if we just select all three of
these here  239.604698 and then we go to export
selection 243.765218 
we'll see how large this is  245.524911 so this is
about twice the size to have all these
in here but it's still not very large at
all 44 kilobytes 251.053842  so anything under a
megabyte is gonna be pretty good  254.164645 let me
just tell you as a rule of thumb what I
would recommend if I was exporting this
I'm gonna delete these stars 259.384957  if I was
going to export this penguin for a
webpage  263.321031 I would select the whole thing  265.781053 I
would choose selection for my export
options  269.405369 I would set the pixels to this
92 dpi which is what it is 273.325493  and I would
have the width and height to be no
larger than 1920   in one direction  280.601255 so
this would be 1920 by 1980 that's still
very very large in fact what I'd
probably do is go to 1080 in one
direction  287.897263 and what that's gonna do if I
just come over here  291.457129 and go to save
export replace  294.001031 so now we have a nice
large picture here  296.491015 and we see if we if
we look at it full screen it looks
perfect for our screen because my screen
right here is 1920 pixels wide by 1080
pixels high  308.621104 if we zoom in it'll get a
little bit grainy here but it's not too
bad because no one's really gonna zoom
in this far 314.301040  in a web page in fact look
it can probably get away with being a
lot smaller than this  318.736969 so rather than
selecting it and trying to shrink it
down like this  322.757073 I'll just leave it I
don't care what size it is over here 325.775652 
I'll change the size on the image size
over here 329.289704  the export size if I wanted to
do speed like 512 by 512 or roughly it's
not completely square  335.993325 and I'll change
this to 92 dpi again 339.029337  and now this will
be a smaller file size and a spot a
smaller image without ever having to
resize it over here on my canvas 347.253425  so hit
export replace and now it's half the
size it's kind of hard to see here 351.797280  but
now if we zoom in it gets a little bit
more grainy more quickly  358.141361 does that make
sense let's say I wanted to print this
and this file size right now is 180 3.7
kilobytes  364.538889 so let's say I wanted to print
this  367.125104 I can leave it the same size again
select the whole thing 369.953154  I almost always
do this selection export  373.793757 I don't usually
do drawing drawings  375.925305 and very dangerous
to do I don't usually do custom 378.737243 
sometimes I'll do page  380.469326 but if I wanted
to print this maybe on like a t-shirt or
a business card or something  385.013247 or I want
to import it into another program to
print  388.145246 I would set my dpi
well first I get the size that I want I
change this to well as we put pixels
down here I change it to inches I might
change my 398.353844  my
units two inches over here 399.657485  so maybe I
would resize this here  401.997137 change the units
to inches and maybe I want to print this
on the side of a vehicle  408.632770 and I want it
to be I would lock this and I would I
want it to be a 24 inches high 414.656656  and then
however wide that would make it  417.716319 and I
can move it over here it doesn't matter
if I'm outside of my page bounds 422.280236  doesn't
matter if there's other objects drawn
over here 424.620291  because with all of this
selected  426.416267 then I will go to selection 428.784228  and
now it's it's gonna be about 24 inches
by 24 inches  434.778627 and I will change this to 439.479770 
if you're putting it on your own unlike
your printer at home you do like 300 dpi 443.937192 
if you're having a professional company
printed 445.630104  you do 600 so if I gotta do 600
dpi  448.218107 so this is gonna be quite large 449.681956  if
we export this  451.030188 it was 183 kilobytes
before look how long it's taken to
export this is just massive 456.562066  so I was
taking a huge long time  461.122306 which tells me I
might have done something wrong when we
pause the video   and let this finish
exporting  464.583173 so this file that got created
it took about a minute to create and
it's 9.1 megabytes  470.909575 that's actually not
too bad of a file that's something that
we could send to a printer and even
though it's a little bit large 477.143028  they want
it really large for their printer they
want as much data as they can get 481.654853  so
they can zoom in and of course with the
vector graphics if we zoom in we never
lose clarity while it's here in Inkscape 487.695342 
but once it's exported we could zoom out 490.371143 
and we and we could zoom in and it would
start to get a little bit pixelated   497.249296  we
can see if   we can open this file here 499.504828 
let me open it with a different program 500.992547 
it's open it in darktable 506.274171 
okay so this is open here in darktable 508.170324 
and we can see we can actually come in
here and click on it and look  512.417345 so we can
see this is the actual PNG image 515.294429  and if
we zoom in here it's very sharp 517.331654  this is
not an SVG but it's just so incredibly
sharp when we scale it gets pixelated 521.879295 
but that's just because we're moving
around  523.307555 that's related to a dark table  525.358448 so
we can see here this is very large this
is I think 100% this is this is how far
we can zoom in before it starts to get
pixel 532.632748 
probably larger than you'd need a mess
you're printing on like a billboard
unless your printer asks for a huge huge
huge file 539.336625  so let's just a little bit
about how to keep your file sizes
manageable if you're doing print design
it's okay to have a large file  547.216804 it's just
a little bit cumbersome to work with but
you want that file to be quite large 550.836965  I
recommend doing 600 dpi when you're
printing  553.300646 unless you're printing at home
on your printer in that case do 300 dpi 557.776992 
and then I would recommend doing
like I said 92 for web if you really
want to get kind of like a very small
file you can do 72 between 92 and 72 for
that  569.266557 and then your sizing if it's gonna
be a little icon a common size for icons
is 256 by 256  575.122233 or you can do like 512 by
512 just you know keep it in mind that
the screen size is 1920 by 1080  583.870453 so if
you're designing something for us screen
you know you rarely want to go above
1080i don't think  589.006335 or maybe 1920 but
anyway  590.582507 that's a little bit of
consideration  594.074399 and how to reduce that
file size  595.754503 and I just recommend getting
more comfortable that this confuses a
lot of people what you're exporting 600.886573  and
then the unit's you're exporting in
again changing this here doesn't affect
the unit's down here this is always
going to be in pixels 608.438789  so you don't have
to do a little bit of math on that in
your head to figure things out 612.276424 
that's what I wanted to show you in this
video  614.588363 I realize a lot of that
information is probably a repeat but
just get comfortable with this 618.908427  and
hopefully that clarifies a little bit
about exporting your artwork  622.764478 and getting
it into other programs and/or printing 626.024214 
thanks for watching go ahead and leave
your questions comments below if you
have any  629.044242 and I'll catch you in the next
video 630.736358  630.736358  630.736358
