00:11
Our gardener is so rude
00:14
I am never going to talk to him again
00:17
Maybe you should try to be nicer to him Tofu
00:23
Perhaps he has no friends and feels lonely
00:27
Yes he doesn’t talk to anyone hence he has no friends
00:34
Why would anyone talk to someone who doesn’t talk to them
00:38
That’s not what Heidi did
00:41
Who is Heidi
00:55
There lived a little girl called Heidi
01:01
She lived with her aunt in the village
01:07
Once it happened that Heidi’s aunt had to go to the big city for work
01:14
She would be gone for a long time
01:18
So she decided to leave Heidi with her grandfather who lived alone on the mountain
01:29
Heidi’s grandfather a carpenter named Alm wasn’t a friendly person because of some experience in his past
01:42
He didn’t like to talk to anyone and that is why he lived all the way up in the mountains
01:51
And now Heidi had to live with him
01:56
Bye-bye Heidi Be a good girl
02:00
Bye Aunty
02:04
Hello
02:06
My name is Heidi
02:08
Hmm
02:10
Heidi waited a while hoping that her grandfather would talk to her
02:18
When she realized he wasn’t going to she decided not to disturb him and instead she went out to see the mountainside
02:31
She had never seen such vast lands of green
02:36
She fell in love with her new home immediately
02:42
She lay down next to a bed of daffodils under the open sky and smiled to herself
02:51
That’s when she heard the goats with bells around their neck
02:59
Meh…meh…
03:04
Oh hello Where did you come from
03:09
I brought them here to feed like I do everyday
03:13
Where did you come from
03:15
Hello My name is Heidi
03:18
I have come here to stay with my grandfather
03:22
Hello Heidi My name is Peter
03:25
Old Grandpa Alm is your grandfather
03:30
He often helps us with furniture and maintaining the barn
03:37
In turn my grandmother bakes bread for him
03:42
You live here with your grandma is it
03:46
Can I meet her
03:48
Yes come with me
03:54
And so Heidi went with her new friend to his house to meet his grandmother
04:03
Peter’s grandmother was very loving
04:07
And although she was blind she loved to talk and cook
04:13
She was very happy when Peter told her about Heidi
04:18
Oh that’s wonderful
04:21
Come here dear Heidi and give me a hug
04:30
Are you hungry
04:34
Well come I will make you some of my special soup
04:41
Heidi spent the rest of the day at Peter’s house and learnt how to make special soup from his grandmother
04:51
Heidi asked her if like Peter she too could call her ‘Granny’ and she was delighted when she agreed
05:04
When it was evening she said goodbye to them and went back to her grandfather’s house
05:20
When she reached there he was still working in his workshop
05:27
So Heidi went into the house
05:34
Sometime later Heidi called out to him
05:39
Dinnertime grandfather Come let’s eat together
05:44
Old Alm looked up in surprise
05:48
No one had made dinner for him in decades
05:53
He closed his workshop for the day washed up and went to eat
06:06
Heidi had made the lovely soup she had learnt from Granny
06:13
They ate in silence
06:21
And although her grandfather liked the soup very much he didn’t say anything
06:29
When dinner was done and the kitchen had been cleaned up they both went out in the yard and sat under the stars quietly
06:52
After sometime Heidi started feeling sleepy and so she kissed Alm good night and went to sleep
07:04
Alm had not experienced so much love in many years and so he sat there with tears in his eyes for a long time
07:19
Next morning by the time Heidi got up her grandfather was already in his workshop
07:31
She decided to go and be with him
07:37
Good morning grandfather
07:40
Hmm
07:42
Heidi knew she wouldn’t get an answer so she decided to make herself busy
07:51
She swept the workshop filled fresh water in Alm’s jar and to his surprise kissed him and went out to feed the hen
08:07
When it was about afternoon she served a lunch of mashed potatoes which she had learnt to make from her aunt
08:18
Later she went to Peter’s house to spend time with granny and returned in the evening to serve dinner
08:29
This went on for many days
08:33
Every morning and night she would kiss her grandfather on the cheek and wish him
08:42
She would clean his workshop and fill fresh water in his jar
08:48
All this love and care that Heidi gave him changed Alm’s behavior
08:56
He loved having Heidi around and enjoyed it very much when Peter and Granny came by to visit her
09:11
One day upon Heidi’s insistence he even took her to the village
09:25
They bought a pair of shoes for Heidi
09:30
On the way back they bought candy floss
09:34
Throughout the trip Alm laughed and played with Heidi
09:40
All the villagers were surprised to see this change in the old carpenter
09:48
Two years went by and Heidi and Alm were very happy in each other’s company
09:56
Till one day Heidi’s aunt returned
10:01
She wanted to take Heidi with her to the big city
10:07
The man whose office she worked in had a daughter
10:10
Klara who couldn’t walk
10:14
Klara always needed a wheel chair to go anywhere
10:19
Hence she had no friends
10:26
Klara’s father wanted Heidi to be Klara’s friend
10:32
Grandfather Tell her I do not wish to go
10:37
I want to live here with you
10:40
But Alm didn’t say anything
10:43
He knew that Heidi would have a much better life in the big city
10:52
And so Heidi left her grandfather
10:55
Peter Granny and the mountainside to live in the big city
11:03
She was straightaway taken to the Mansion where Klara lived
11:09
There she met Klara’s father
11:14
He was a very kind and loving gentleman who loved Klara very much but often had to travel a lot for business
11:25
During these times he left Klara in the care of her grandmother and a rather stern housekeeper
11:35
Hello Heidi I am Klara’s father
11:39
I wanted to thank you for coming here
11:44
I am sure you will like living here with Klara
11:49
If you ever need anything please let me know
11:54
Now come I will take you to Klara’s room
12:02
When they entered Klara’s room
12:05
Heidi saw a beautiful girl maybe two years elder to Heidi sitting on a wheelchair
12:14
She was very pretty but she was frail and seemed sad
12:20
The housekeeper pushed the wheelchair forward towards Heidi
12:26
Klara this is Heidi
12:28
She will live with us now
12:31
I will see you both in the evening now
12:34
ByeBye
12:39
Saying so he and Heidi’s aunt left to attend their business
12:46
For a while Heidi didn’t know what to say to Klara
12:50
My friend Peter has many goats
12:54
Sometimes I can’t make out whether he controls the goats or they control him
13:02
Hearing this Klara also broke into giggles
13:06
And Heidi immediately knew that they were going to be very good friends
13:22
She started spending her whole day with Klara
13:29
She would tell her many tales of the mountains while Klara would tell her about the different cities she had stayed in after her mother had passed away
13:42
While the housekeeper was very stern and always stopped the girls from enjoying themselves too much
13:50
Klara’s grandmother was very nice
13:54
She even taught Heidi how to read
13:57
Everybody who met Klara now noted how happy she looked
14:08
One day the girls went out to the market
14:14
As Heidi pushed the wheelchair forward she saw a vendor selling daffodils
14:23
She was immediately reminded of home her grandfather
14:29
Peter and Granny
14:34
When they came back from the market Klara asked Heidi
14:39
Wasn’t today fun Heidi
14:42
What do you think of my new bracelet
14:48
Ya
14:49
Its lovely
14:51
And so it went from that day
14:55
Heidi didn’t want to play or sing with Klara and she wouldn’t read with Klara’s grandmother she wouldn’t even eat unless was forced to
15:08
She would just keep doing her work quietly
15:13
She missed her home terribly and her heart broke every time she looked out of the window and saw buildings and towers instead of mountains and sky
15:30
This went on till one day she fell terribly ill
15:38
Klara’s father called the doctor right away well
15:48
I am afraid she is homesick
15:51
She misses home
15:53
No medicine or treatment can make her better unless she goes back
16:00
I will immediately make arrangements to send her home
16:05
True to his word Klara’s father made sure that Heidi was back in the mountain at her Grandfather’s house in two days
16:17
Just the news of going back home had made Heidi feel better and when she reached her grandfather’s home she ran to him and hugged him
16:30
Even Alm was very happy to have Heidi back
16:36
I am never going away Grandfather
16:39
You don’t have to
16:44
Grandfather this is Klara
16:47
She is my friend from the city
16:50
She has come to stay with us for a few days
16:54
And that is Klara’s father
17:01
As the two men shook hands
17:04
Peter came over
17:07
The children were very excited to see each other
17:12
You must be Peter
17:14
Heidi has told me all about you
17:17
You must take me to your Granny
17:20
Yes yes Come
17:22
I will push your chair
17:24
Granny would love to meet you
17:27
After some time Klara’s father said goodbye to everyone
17:36
He would come back in few weeks to take Klara back to the city
17:41
The children waved him goodbye
17:46
In the next few days the children had a lot of fun
17:50
Peter and Heidi would take Klara along with them everywhere
17:58
Peter would pluck fresh fruits for them and they even showed her how to milk a cow
18:08
With the good air environment of the mountainside Klara grew stronger
18:16
So much that she even learnt to walk by herself
18:26
Soon it was time for Klara’s father to come and take her away
18:33
When he came she surprised him by walking up to his carriage
18:42
Oh my darling I am so happy
18:46
As they left everybody was happy
18:50
There was no sadness in anyone’s heart byebye
18:56
I will visit you soon
18:59
I will too Goodbye Take care
19:04
So you see Tofu when you are kind and loving towards someone you can change their whole life
19:13
Yes Tia Thank you for teaching me this valuable lesson
19:18
Perhaps I will take some chocolates for the gardener
