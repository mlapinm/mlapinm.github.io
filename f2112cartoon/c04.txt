00:13
Look at that girl Tia
00:16
That boy will beat her up easily
00:23
I don't think she should get into a fight with him
00:27
No Tofu
00:28
The boy was wrong to have stolen her bag
00:32
And the girl deserves a chance to get it back
00:36
But she is a girl
00:38
She can't win against a boy like that
00:41
She will get hurt
00:43
Just because she is a girl doesn't mean she has to fear Tofu
00:49
Girls also have a lot of courage and strength
00:53
Do you know of a girl like that
00:55
Yes I do her name is MULAN
01:00
Mulan Who is she
01:19
Mulan lived in Ancient China with her parents
01:25
She was their only child
01:28
Her only companion was her dog called Little Brother
01:34
Mulan's father used to be a great warrior but he had hurt his leg in a war and couldn't fight anymore
01:46
One day a messenger came from the Emperor
01:53
The Huns – China’s army - had attacked and at least one man from each army had been ordered to join the Emperor's Imperial Army
02:07
This was terrible news for Mulan and her family as it meant that her father would have to go back to war
02:25
That night when her parents had slept
02:31
Mulan had an idea
02:36
She took her father's sword and cut her hair off
02:41
Then she put on his warrior's uniform and she looked just like a man
02:58
She took Little Brother and made her way to the Imperial army's campsite
03:12
There she met Captain Li Shang
03:16
What is your name
03:17
Ping Sir
03:19
Very well then Time to begin your training
03:25
Mulan was delighted that everybody had accepted her as a man and started her training
03:36
Sadly she lagged behind all the other warriors
03:43
You are not fit to be in my army
03:46
You are slowing everyone down
03:49
Go back to your village
04:00
Returning to her village would have brought great shame to her family so Mulan came up with another plan
04:12
She wrote a fake letter to the army saying that the Huns have attacked
04:18
Reading the letter Li Shang ordered his army
04:23
Onward with me march to the mountains we shall defeat the Huns forever
04:32
As the army was crossing the pass that lead to the mountains they found themselves surrounded by thousands of Huns
04:41
We've been cheated
04:43
The Huns were supposed to be in the mountains
04:46
Soon the entire Imperial army was under attack
04:56
Mulan had another idea
05:00
She took the last cannon and let it
05:06
There was a huge blast which destroyed most of the Huns
05:11
But it injured Mulan too
05:16
She was rushed to the Doctor's tent
05:22
Bring Ping to this bed
05:24
I will take care of him
05:29
But there was a surprise waiting for the Doctor
05:47
Oh my God Ping is a woman
05:51
Get me Captain Li Shang immediately
05:59
The doctor told the captain what she'd found
06:07
Few days later when the army started moving
06:11
Shang spoke to Mulan
06:15
You have cheated me
06:19
But you also saved the army in the passes
06:22
Hence your punishment is that you can no longer be a part of the army
06:28
You will not come with us
06:34
Mulan was very upset and heart broken
06:40
She needed to do something to save her family's honour
06:46
That's when she heard the Hun's voices
06:54
Oh no the Hun's are still alive
06:57
I must warn the Captain
07:00
And so Mulan raced to Imperial City to warn Shang
07:09
They are alive
07:11
We must prepare for another attack from the Huns
07:15
I cannot trust you anymore
07:17
You have cheated me before
07:20
You are not welcome here leave
07:24
Mulan tried to inform the other leaders but no one would listen to her
07:32
Meanwhile the Hun leader Shan-Yu attacked the city and kidnapped the Emperor
07:48
Li Shang and Mulan freed the Emperor
07:56
Mulan then enticed Shan-Yu to follow her to the rooftop
08:22
There she tricked him and grabbed his sword and pinned his coat to the roof
08:30
As the two armies collided there was a huge explosion and the roof was destroyed taking with it Shan-Yu
08:50
Mulan fell to the ground
08:54
When she sat up she saw that the Imperial Army had won and the Huns had been banished from the city forever
09:05
The Emperor was very happy with Mulan's bravery and gifted her a sword as a token of appreciation
09:19
Mulan went home and presented the sword to her father who was very happy with the honour that his daughter had brought to the family
09:36
Suddenly there was a knock at the door it was captain Li Shang he’d come to return Mulan her helmet that she’s forgotten
09:50
Mulan invited him to stay for dinner and he graciously accepted
09:59
So you see Tofu girls can do anything they put their heart to
10:06
Tofu
10:07
Tofu Are you listening to me
10:09
Yes Tia I am
10:12
I am just thinking how wrong I was to think that girls can't fight
10:19
Well now you know
10:21
So better be very careful before you pick up fight with a girl next time
