00:20
Could you help me with one more thing please
00:24
Sure what is it
00:26
Joe has invited me for the Easter celebration at his home but I feel I don’t know a lot about Easter
00:36
Do you think you could tell me something about it of course Tofu I will
00:55
Easter is the celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion
01:04
About 2000 years ago
01:07
Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey
01:16
There he started preaching the people the right and the wrong they were doing
01:26
He performed many miracles too
01:30
He fed many many people on just a little bit of food he healed the sick and even brought back the dead to life
01:43
He was loved and followed by many many people
01:49
But there were some others who felt threatened by the popularity he was gaining
01:56
These people got together with Judas Iscariot a disciple of Jesus who too was jealous of all the love that he was receiving
02:10
Judas agreed to betray Jesus for 30 pieces of silver
02:18
One night Jesus sat down with his disciples to have a meal
02:25
He told his friends that the next day he would leave them all and join his Father in heaven as one amongst them had already taken money to betray him
02:40
At this point Judas left them all and walked away
02:48
Later Judas came back with the priest’s men who took him away
02:57
The Jewish leaders asked him if he was the Son of God
03:03
When Jesus said yes the Jewish leaders said this was an insult to God and he should be punished
03:14
Eventually on Friday
03:16
Jesus was nailed to a cross through his hands and feet and the cross was raised to stand
03:27
Jesus stayed nailed to the cross till night when he finally died
03:36
This day came to be known as Good Friday
03:41
Friends of Jesus and Mary his mother brought him down from the cross and laid him in a cave and made it his tomb
03:58
They sealed the cave with a rock
04:03
Mary Magdalena a friend of Jesus visited his tomb two days later on a Sunday
04:12
But the tomb was open and Jesus’s body was not there
04:19
When Jesus’s mother found out about it she broke down crying
04:26
A stranger came to her then and told her that her son was now with the Lord
04:33
She asked him how he knew this
04:38
The man told her that he was Jesus he had risen from the dead
04:46
Mary overjoyed to know this she spread the word of Jesus’ resurrection and this day came to be celebrated as Easter Sunday
05:01
Wow Tia Thanks for telling me all this
05:06
All I knew about Easter was that Christians consider this as a very sacred day go to the church and cook good food
05:18
