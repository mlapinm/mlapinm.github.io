It is still early morning and Tia is sneaking around Tofu’s room
00:19
She puts a beautifully wrapped gift box on his desk
00:28
The calendar on the wall says 1st of April
00:34
She sneaks out again hides and waits for Tofu to get up
00:41
Tofu gets up sees the box and gets very excited
00:48
Oh wow What’s that is it a gift for me
01:03
I wonder who it’s from
01:07
Let me open it and see
01:15
Huh
01:17
It’s empty
01:30
Oh sweet Tofu Its so easy to prank you
01:36
Oh
01:38
You did this Tia Why would you do such a mean thing to me
01:44
Oh cheer up Tofu It’s April Fool’s Day
01:48
I can’t cheer up after what you just did to me Tia and also I don’t know what April Fool’s Day is
01:57
Okay let me tell you about it maybe then you won’t feel so bad about my little prank Tofu
02:15
There are so many different stories about how 1st April came to be celebrated as April Fool’s Day
02:25
But the most widespread one is about the calendar
02:32
In the year 1582
02:35
Pope Gregory the XIII introduced a new calendar the Gregorian calendar
02:43
This calendar started the New Year on the 1st of January
02:53
But back then information took time to spread
02:59
Remember there was no Internet or phone back then
03:06
So for a long time many people didn’t know about the change in the calendar and many others who knew about it refused to accept the new calendar
03:21
These people continued to celebrate the New Year’s Day on 1st of April
03:30
The people who had accepted the new calendar now started making fun of these non-believers
03:42
They would lead them to believe in things that did not exist or even send them on fool’s errands errands that didn’t exist
04:02
Eventually the new calendar was accepted worldwide but the pranks stayed on
04:11
Friends siblings relatives and even parents often play tricks on their loved ones on 1st April
04:24
All the pranks are just for harmless fun and never to hurt anyone
04:31
They usually end with the pranksters shouting “April Fool” and peels of laughter from everywhere
04:41
So you see Tofu pranking you was a part of the celebration
04:48
I don’t care I am really upset with what you did with me Tia
04:55
Oh no Tofu I am really sorry
04:58
I didn’t think you would feel so bad
05:01
What can I do to make it up to you
05:05
Just accept that I made a better April Fool of you Tia
05:12
You were pretending to be angry with me
05:16
Yes I was
05:18
I guess I should be more careful around you today then
05:22
Yes…you should
