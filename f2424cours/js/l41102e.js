"Hello, and welcome to the first course in the Django for Everybody specialization.",
"The purpose of this course is to in effect make it so that the only prerequisite you need are Python skills.",
"Like you might have taken the Python for Everybody specialization and finished that, and then you can come here.",
"And so I don't want to put a bunch of prerequisites, like HTML, and CSS, and SQL.",
"And so what I've done is I've just covered all the foundational knowledge that sort of supports the rest of the specialization in this class.",
"We're going to use PythonAnywhere.",
"In this first class, we're going to install Django.",
"We're going to use it for some HTML, CSS, and SQL assignments.",
"And so the idea is to get everybody on the same page when we finish this course so that we can sort of at that point start digging into learning how Python and Django work together.",
