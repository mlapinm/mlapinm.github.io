Angie: Why I love cleaning data1m.
I am Angie.
I'm a program manager of engineering at Google.
I truly believe that cleaning Data is the heart and soul of data.
It's how you get to know your data: its quirks, its flaws, it's mysteries.
I love a good mystery.
I remember one time I found somebody had purchased, I think it was one million dollars worth of chicken sandwiches in one transaction.
This mystery drove me nuts.
I had all these questions.
Could this have really happened?
Or maybe it was a really big birthday party?
How did they make a million dollars worth of chicken sandwiches?
I was cleaning my data and trying to figure out where did it go wrong.
We ended up finding out that we'd been squaring and multiplying all of our transactions for a very specific case.
It took us about three days to figure this out.
I will never forget the moment when it was like, aha!
We got to the bottom of it.
The result is our data was cleaned, and we had this great dataset that we could use for analysis.
But what I loved was just the mystery of it and getting to know all these weird intricacies about my dataset.
It felt like a superpower almost, like I was a detective, and I had gone in there and I had really solved something.
I love cleaning data!
