About the data-analyst hiring process 1m.
Hey there, thanks for stopping by once again.
So earlier we checked out some potential career paths that might open up for you once you complete the program.
You might also have explored the advantages of networking and building an online presence.
And I want to tell you just by being here now, you've shown you're committed.
You're taking a big step in your future career.
Coming up, we'll spend some time building your resume.
You might already have a resume that you've used or been saving and that's great.
There's a good chance you'll still be able to use it even if you're planning to switch careers.
Together we'll find out what kinds of changes to your resume you might want to make.
But before that, we'll figure out what the whole application process is like.
Then we'll explore the best way to write or adjust your resume to make it as professional-looking as possible and ready for your role as a data analyst.
We'll also take a peek at some examples of other resumes.
After that, we'll have you do a little self-analysis as we review the different types of data analyst jobs out there, so you can think about which ones might be best for you.
While I'm definitely not a career counselor, we can still think of this as a kind of career counseling session.
You'll get a better idea of how to build your resume while thinking about your bigger career picture at the same time.
So let's get started!
