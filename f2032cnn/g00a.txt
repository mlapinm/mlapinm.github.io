21:What is the default behavior of a Layer 2 switch when a frame with an unknown destination MAC address is received?
Explanation: When the switch receives a frame dedicated for a particular destination but that destination does not have an entry in the MAC Address Table, the switch has no choice but to flood the frame. The goal of this flood is that the device using the MAC address in the destination of the frame will receive the flood and respond to the message. If that device responds, then the switch can learn their MAC address and map it to the port into which the message arrives.
