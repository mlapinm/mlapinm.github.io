  "for me after making a lot of money i want to live by myself.",
  "and my two cats in a big house.",
  "what kind of big house are you talking about.",
  "i would say a two-story house in the suburbs.",
  "it would be really spacious with a small garden in the front so my cats can sunbathe.",
  "and sometimes i can enjoy my breakfast outdoors.",
  "doesn't it sound lovely.",
  "yes it sounds really nice.",
  "but why the suburbs i thought you liked the city.",
  "not really i like the convenience here.",
  "but there are too many people and the air is too polluted.",
  "the suburb would be a perfect choice.",
  "it's not that far away.",
  "it's quiet and it has fresh air.",
  "what about the interior of your house.",
  "how many rooms will you have.",
  "i want to have two bedrooms.",
  "one for me and one for guests.",
  "there will be a reading room so i can concentrate to read.",
  "and also for me to put my many books.",
  "the kitchen is also really important.",
  "oh there must be a living room too.",
  "what colors will you decorate your house with.",
  "it will be creamy white and silver.",
  "those will be the two main colors of my house.",
  "hey i just realized now.",
  "you are not planning to get married.",
  "your dream house does not have a room for kids.",
  "well that will be another time story.",
  "for now i just want to live with my cats peacefully.",
  "what about you guys.",
  "i think i would like.",
  "to live in a suburb like liz.",
  "but instead of a two-story house it will be a two-story villa.",
  "i want a pool as well so i can have a pool party every week.",
  "as expected from you you party animal.",
  "what about the inside of the villa though.",
  "i bet you want a movie room or something like that.",
  "for sure you know me so well.",
  "nothing can go wrong with a movie room.",
  "i can invite you guys over for our horror friday to watch horror movies.",
  "let me see my house's main colors will be black white and yellow.",
  "yellow would be a nice touch to a monochrome themed house.",
  "oh i also like natural light so there must be many windows as well big ones.",
  "your dream house seems to be very chick what about a garage.",
  "would there be any garage.",
  "of course there would be a big garage.",
  "so i can park my shiny sports car.",
  "you dream a dream too big now jim.",
  "hey no one taxes your dream.",
  "at least it can be a goal for me to work hard for.",
  "what about you anna have you ever thought about your dream house would be like.",
  "oh yes of course i have.",
  "unlike you two i want to live in the city.",
  "so you want a luxurious penthouse in a tall apartment building.",
  "no actually i prefer staying on the ground.",
  "so a small flat would be the best for me.",
  "i don't like anything flashy either an average cozy flat would be nice.",
  "tell us more about it how do you like your flat to be.",
  "i think it can be a two story flat with three bedrooms.",
  "i want to marry my boyfriend and our small family would stay there.",
  "the house let me think.",
  "um i think i will paint it yellow and white.",
  "i like those two colors the most.",
  "they can also brighten up the house as well.",
  "oh i want my house to have spacious balconies.",
  "so we can enjoy the fresh air.",
  "that sounds very lovely but do you want to live in the center of the city.",
  "if so i don't think it's possible though.",
  "there are only tall apartment buildings in the center of the city.",
  "yeah i know about that.",
  "so i'm thinking about a residential area that would be a bit further away from the center of the city.",
  "there will be enough convenience like shopping malls but there will be fewer people and it will be quieter.",
  "that's nice.",
  "thank you.",
  "i think you guys's dream houses are very nice too.",
  "it's just that our lifestyles are different right.",
  "yeah you are right.",
  "i enjoy an active lively life.",
  "you're more family oriented.",
  "and liz loves focusing on herself.",
  "i wonder when can we achieve our dream.",
  "it cannot be too soon.",
  "we still have a long way to go.",
  "but i think eventually we will be able to achieve our goals.",
  "yeah guys let's all work hard together.",
  "thank you guys for the talk it was really fun.",
  "i'm getting back to my class now.",
  "gotta work hard for that dream house right.",
  "okay see you jim.",
  "bye.",
  "hi guys so after our conversation.",
  "what would our dream houses be like.",
  "liz loves to live in a suburb house with her cats.",
  "and she won't get married anytime soon.",
  "about anna she is family oriented.",
  "and wants to build a truly home.",
  "as for me i love flashy things such as a villa pool movie room and shiny sports cars.",
  "what about you guys.",
  "what would your dream house be like.",
  "don't forget to leave a comment to let me know.",
  "in the next video we will have a reunion at liz's house.",
  "and talk about what we want to be in the future.",
  "i know we talked about this several times.",
  "anna you always want to start a business.",
  "but the question is what kind of business my friend.",
