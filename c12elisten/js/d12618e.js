  "so i usually don't go to bed until about three am.",
  "i find it difficult to go to sleep early.",
  "don't you have to go to work.",
  "i am on my summer holiday now.",
  "if i have class from the first period every day.",
  "so i will have to get up about 7 30 or 8 am.",
  "so i will probably sleep earlier.",
  "it is really challenging for me you know.",
  "i tried to go to bed early 10 o'clock 11 30 before midnight and i try to get up early 6 30 7 before 8 but it doesn'talways work.",
  "what about you what time do you often go to bed.",
  "well i usually wake up maybe six or seven in the morning.",
  "but i don't get up straight away.",
  "i stay in bed for a while maybe read a book or something.",
  "check my phone messages and i get up at maybe 7 30 8 o'clock.",
  "on the weekend i often get up at 6 o'clock to go to the park with my father.",
  "we go jogging together.",
  "you are having a very healthy life.",
  "what about during the holiday.",
  "if it's a day off i get up at 9 or 10.",
  "and in the evening i usually go to bed around 10 11 sometimes 12.",
  "do you need an alarm clock to wake you up or you just wake up naturally every day.",
  "i actually have this kind of special mental ability.",
  "i feel it a bit weird i thought that everybody can do this but i found out it's not the case.",
  "but i can wake up exactly the minute i want anytime.",
  "that's amazing even though i wake up kinda easily.",
  "i can't wake up at a routine time.",
  "so i usually set the alarm on my phone and about two alarm clocks as well that will usually get me up.",
  "so like if i have to get up at 6 14 before i go to bed i can say okay get up at 6 14 and i'll wake up at exactly 6 14.",
  "how do you do that tell me please.",
  "yeah i don't know how i guess your brain can just keep time.",
  "when i tell people this sometimes they think oh come on that's not true.",
  "but really ever since i was a kid i could just tell myself what time i want to wake up and i'll wake up exactly at that time.",
  "that's really quite amazing i wish it was that way for me but it's not.",
  "yeah you know what's weird because i don't use alarm clocks.",
  "what do you mean.",
  "i can't like an alarm clock the idea actually i can't have a deep sleep if i know that it's going to ring and wake me up.",
  "an alarm clock is like somebody pouring cold water on you you know.",
  "yeah i'm always paranoid about being late so that's why i set three just in case one doesn't go off.",
  "but i can sleep any time of the day.",
  "wow that's like you do you like sleep.",
  "like it really doesn't matter what occasion or type of day it's very easy for me to fall asleep.",
  "for as long as whenever.",
  "so that's why i need to have many things to wake me up because i could sleep 12 or 14 hours and not wake up.",
  "so do you take naps.",
  "usually an hour.",
  "i find out if i go over an hour then that's the danger zone.",
  "because then if you sleep like two or three hours.",
  "you wake up and you're just groggy for the whole day.",
  "and if i sleep a lot during noon when i wake up i usually have headaches.",
  "so now i am trying not to take naps.",
  "like can you sleep with the light on.",
  "yes i can sleep in any situation light noise standing sitting up never matters to me i can still sleep.",
  "so you're definitely a deep sleeper i'm so jealous of that.",
  "like just a tiny bit of noise or a little bit of light and i can't sleep.",
  "and actually i probably only get an average of five hours a night but.",
  "i do sometimes take naps.",
  "yeah not for two i mean i can't sleep forever but like seven o'clock eight o'clock.",
  "then my body naturally wakes up.",
  "the flat i lived at before was incredibly crazy.",
  "because there was a rooster outside and it didn't do what it was supposed to do like normal when the sun comes up.",
  "the rooster is supposed to go or whatever.",
  "but this thing did it at like one and two in the morning it used to drive me nuts.",
  "so i used to always wake up at two because i'd hear this rooster going and i just wanted to kill that bird.",
  "did you go back to sleep after that.",
  "yeah of course i went back to sleep.",
  "but the bird would wake me up regularly.",
  "yeah no roosters here.",
  "true let's go.",
  "talk about being sick.",
  "a sick classmate.",
  "what's up guys.",
  "nothing much.",
  "have you done the homework mr watson gave us.",
  "it's due tomorrow so i haven't done anything.",
  "oh really what a relief.",
  "but i'm afraid i got bad news.",
  "chris is sick so he won't come to class today.",
  "he is sick with what exactly.",
  "nobody told us.",
  "i hope he is still doing fine.",
  "well i only knew about this minutes ago.",
  "i heard his mother talking with our teacher in the hall she mentioned him catching a cold last night or something.",
  "is he okay.",
  "his mother sounds not so worried about his condition.",
  "so i assume he is fine.",
  "if it's really just a common cold.",
  "he will be fine in a few days.",
  "should we call him to check up on him.",
  "i guess he could use some encouragement.",
  "but it's only seven in the morning.",
  "i think he is still asleep.",
  "let him have his rest.",
  "sick people desperately need sleep to recover.",
  "we can text him though.",
  "he can read it whenever he wakes up.",
  "good idea.",
  "what should we tell him.",
  "just simply explain how we know he is ill and ask him for his condition first.",
  "then tell him we got him covered on schoolwork and other news.",
  "also tell him to take his medication seriously.",
  "there was one time that he was sick but delayed taking medication so it continued for like two weeks.",
  "he got ill more severe than a comet cold.",
  "i can't remember its name though.",
  "i recalled anything else.",
  "should we visit him after school.",
  "okay but let's buy him some fruits along the way.",
  "an apple a day keeps the doctor away.",
  "and some oranges would help out a lot.",
  "i agree then.",
  "i'll tell him in advance.",
  "what else can we do to help him.",
  "mr watson homework.",
  "knowing his nature i doubt he has given it a single thought.",
  "well then to help him is to help ourselves too.",
  "hey guys chris is replying to me.",
  "what did he say.",
  "he thanked us for caring.",
  "and he got the best person around to look after him.",
  "does he mean his mom.",
  "yeah i also assume he was talking about his mom too anyway chris told me that he is going well.",
  "and he had enough fruits to last a week.",
  "he would appreciate a visit from us though.",
  "then we will go straight to his house after school.",
  "i guess so.",
  "tell him that and also mention that tomorrow is the due date for mr watson's homework.",
  "and i'll tell him that we will come over to finish that thing too.",
  "it's for the best.",
  "okay i'll tell him exactly that.",
  "well then we will talk later.",
  "okay.",
  "calling in sick.",
  "dad can you please call mr ronan and tell him i need two days off.",
  "sure son you should use my phone to talk to him.",
  "i saved him as mr ronin on my phone.",

  "just introduce yourself and be brief about my current condition.",
  "hello peter what's up.",
  "hello mr ronan.",

  "do you have something that can prove your son's current condition.",

  "but i haven't seen them before.",
  "oh my alice you're 15 years old.",
  "why do you think they exist in reality.",

  "we cannot see we just believe in it.",
  "in other words they are like ancestors.",
  "i thought i could see them and ask them for help when i'm punished by you.",
  "i really need to learn much more about the vietnamese rituals.",
  "i'm considering myself a silly person.",
  "what a shame unfortunately they don't exist.",
  "so you'll be punished without any help if your naughty little daughter.",

  "please give me a reason mom.",
  "according to vietnamese opinion.",
  "we shouldn't sweep the house.",
  "or empty out rubbish on the first day of the year to avoid luck and benefits going with it.",

  "but at that time you just smiled.",
  "how observant you are.",
  "and you don't need to hide that from me.",
  "you can confide in me i'm really open-minded about that.",

  "well so basically one of the pillars of your way of staying healthy is to have the discipline to exercise regularly.",
  "but it doesn't have to be strenuous just little things.",

  "whether it's walking or whether it's riding your bicycle to work instead of taking the subway or yeah doing some yoga.",

  "i had to leave my school friends relatives known places.",
  "and start living in a place where i had no friends no one to visit and no known place for playing or outing.",
  "that should be a frustrating experience for you.",
  "but i made new friends very quickly.",
  "and my teachers were very helpful as well.",
  "but one problem is that i could not secure even a top 10 position in my new school while i was a top scorer in my previous.",

  "i shrink my time playing games and took part in football.",
  "well those changes helped you study more learn more and remain healthy.",

  "for me i think i am not healthier than i was about 10 years ago.",
  "why do you think so.",
  "lately i have been so busy that i have not been taking enough time to exercise or cook healthy food.",
  "do you think you will have a healthy diet soon.",
  "i am having a plan for it.",
  "i'm going to clean out my fridge all of my favorite unhealthy foods and begin cooking homemade meals.",
  "i think i will also drink two liters of water a day instead of soft drinks.",

  "i rarely got sick and my skin also looked brighter.",
  "i can see that on your face.",
  "i think i regained my self-confidence.",
  "i am now much more comfortable being photographed.",
  "when i was a teenager i mainly subsisted on fast foods such as fried chicken hamburgers or crisps.",
  "i put on weight rapidly so i think now is the time to start my weight loss journey or i will become overweight.",
  "that's true we are older we should be healthier.",
  "right okay.",
  "what about stress are you more stressed now than you were three years ago.",
  "that's a hard question i'm probably about the same.",
  "so i wouldn't say that i'm more stressed now.",
  "but three years ago i was finishing my bachelor's degree so that was also a stressful time.",
  "and lately i've been quite busy with my work so i'm probably at the same stress level as three years ago.",
  "i think i'm now not as stressed as i was in the past actually because i worry less.",
  "so before i was more stressed because i worried about everything.",
  "and now i've learned to let it go.",

  "so how do you usually reduce stress.",
  "actually there are many things that can make me happy.",

  "it refreshes my mind and cheers me up a lot.",
  "besides cooking delicious dishes for the family also helps me feel relaxed after stressful hours at my workplace.",
  "perhaps now we have more stress because of the heavy workload and related responsibilities at the workplace.",
  "some people may have to face problems related to the financial burdens in which they may not have enough money to pay for their increasing house rent.",
  "there's a lot more to think about in the future.",
  "we are older now so.",
  "we are more worried about money.",
  "but maybe in the next 10 years job security things like that.",
  "so sadly i'm a little more worried about that.",
  "right everything will be fine.",
  "how about you are you more worried about your future these days.",
  "i'm quite sure i have a good job and i like the place i live.",
  "so i don't feel too worried about what i will be doing next year or even seven years.",
  "but we should probably plan ahead a bit more.",

  "well this is a healthy attitude to have.",
  "are there any changes in our town.",
  "i think it developed significantly in the last 10 years.",
  "did it become industrialized.",
  "yes it did.",
  "i think industrialization is beneficial to our residents and to the local economy since jobs have been generated.",
  "but it also brings so much pollution.",
  "I think we are paying the price now for converting our agricultural lands to industrial.",
  "the living cost is now undeniably high too.",
  "noise pollution is incredible.",
  "you know now i am getting used to the crowd in the wisdom city.",
  "so basically our city has progressed but there are still underlying issues that need to be improved.",

  "definitely we don't have to think about studying at school anymore.",
  "yes and we are happy with our jobs families and friends.",
  "and i have more free time now so i can spend more time on entertainment too.",
