  "p11 SPEAK ENGLISH FLUENTLY.",
  "Hey in today's English lesson, I'm going to teach you how to speak English fluently, like a native English speaker using the simple rule of threes.",
  "Now, this lesson is going to help you speak English with more confidence, but if you want to continue studying with me on a daily basis, all you have to do is go to www.dailyenglishlessons.com.",
  "These lessons will help you go.",
  "Intermediate English learner all the way to an advanced English learner.",
  "So again, if you want to go to the advanced English level, all you have to do is go to daily English lessons.com.",
  "Now are you ready?.",
  "Well, then I'm teacher, Tiffani let's jump right in.",
  "So the basics of the simple rule of threes, you see, when I was in high school, my English teachers taught me this rule.",
  "And basically it says you need to provide enough support for your thoughts, your ideas and opinions by giving three details.",
  "Three examples or three reasons.",
  "So let's start with the first part of this rule.",
  "The very first part of this rule says, again, dealing with the three details you have to give the important details of the topic subject or a person you are discussing in English.",
  "In other words, you want to help your listener visualize what you are talking.",
  "You see English fluency is not just about the words you use.",
  "It's really about the listeners ability to understand you and to visualize what you are speaking about.",
  "So let's say for example, you were having a conversation with someone and all of a sudden the topic came up.",
  "Of the beach and they asked you, what do you and your friends normally do at the beach?.",
  "Now you can give a simple response.",
  "Ah, we normally play in the water now to be very honest, this is a good response, but it's not an advanced level response.",
  "Instead using the simple rule of threes.",
  "Again, the first part being three details, we can add more information.",
  "So detail number one, big waves, detail.",
  "Number two, frigid water and detail.",
  "Number three, extremely salty.",
  "Now, even though we haven't given our full response, just.",
  "Simply with those three details.",
  "Even you started to imagine the situation a little bit more, right?.",
  "So let's dive into it and see what our response would be using.",
  "The three details we just mentioned.",
  "So here's the response now?.",
  "Not a short response, but a fluent English response.",
  "Ah, my friends and I normally play in the water when we go to the beach.",
  "We love to plunge into the big waves, even though the frigid water usually shocks us.",
  "We love being together in the water.",
  "The water is usually extremely salty as well, but we still love it.",
  "You see what happened?.",
  "Right.",
  "I counted out the three details.",
  "Again, part one of this simple rule of threes is again, three details.",
  "So I gave you the three details in this response of fluent English response.",
  "Now, within the response, you noticed that there are things that are bolded.",
  "I want to teach you some new expressions and words.",
  "So the first one is plunge into, so repeat after me plunge into.",
  "Good again, plunge into excellent.",
  "Last time plunge into.",
  "Great job now, plunge into this just means to push something or into something quickly and forcefully to suddenly start doing something actively or enthusiastically.",
  "So again, to push something into something now, remember from the response we looked.",
  "We love to plunge into the big waves.",
  "We push our bodies, forcefully into the waves in English.",
  "We say plunge into now the next word.",
  "Maybe you've never heard it before.",
  "I want you to repeat after me frigid.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Again, after.",
  "Frigid.",
  "Great job last time after me frigid.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Now this word just means very cold in temperature.",
  "Again, very cold.",
  "Woo.",
  "The frigid water.",
  "You know how, when something is really cold or you walk into a room and it's really cold or the water is really cold.",
  "When you step into a pool, your body normally shakes a little.",
  "Because of the frigid temperature or the frigid water in English, we say frigid.",
  "Excellent.",
  "So now you understand the new word and the new expression, and you also realize that our response.",
  "Was a fluent English response because we used three details.",
  "But remember I said, this simple rule of threes has three parts part, number two of this simple rule of threes deals with examples.",
  "So giving three examples, the second part of this rule, Focuses on examples of the topic subject or a person you are discussing.",
  "So in other words, you want to help your listener understand more by giving them real life examples situations.",
  "So we're gonna check out the same question we just looked at.",
  "So again, talking about you and your friends and remember the topic.",
  "The beach.",
  "What do you and your friends normally do at the beach?.",
  "Our simple response.",
  "Once again was we normally play in the water once again, simple response, the same question, but now we're looking at three examples.",
  "Let's see what happens.",
  "Our first example, surfing in the evening example, two surfing in the morning before work.",
  "And example three surfing every day in the summer.",
  "So once again, we have the question, we have our basic response, but now we're giving three examples, real life examples.",
  "So the listener can connect more.",
  "So let's check out our response again, using the three examples.",
  "Here's our response, right?.",
  "My friends and I really enjoy playing in the water when we go to the beach basic response.",
  "For example, when we have time after work, we normally go surfing in the evening.",
  "We also enjoy getting up at the crack of Dawn to go surfing before work.",
  "And number three, finally, once the summertime comes, we usually end up going surfing every single.",
  "That is a fluent English response.",
  "I gave you three examples and it helped you understand more when my friends and I go to the beach and why we enjoy playing in the water and real life situations, three examples.",
  "Now, in this response, you see that I mentioned a new expression.",
  "Crack of Dawn.",
  "I want you to repeat after me.",
  "Crack of Dawn.",
  "Good job again.",
  "Crack of Dawn.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Last time.",
  "Crack of Dawn.",
  "Great job now, crack of Dawn.",
  "This literally just means a time very early in the morning or day break.",
  "Now I wake.",
  "Very true at the crack of Dawn.",
  "I normally wake up at 4:00 AM and sometimes at 5:00 AM.",
  "I am an early bird.",
  "So I normally wake.",
  "At the crack of Dawn again, very early in the morning.",
  "Maybe you also wake up at the crack of Dawn, but again, you understand using the simple rule of threes.",
  "Part two is again, three examples.",
  "Now let's take a look at part number three.",
  "Of this simple rule.",
  "Here's the simple explanation.",
  "All right.",
  "Again, part number three, understanding the three reasons.",
  "So the third part of this rule focuses on giving specific reasons for your ideas on the topic subject or a person you are discuss.",
  "In other words you want to help your listener understand your thought process and how you developed your idea.",
  "Remember, we are talking about improving your English fluency.",
  "We haven't even dove into grammar or vocabulary words, or many other things we're focusing.",
  "How you think in English, how you organize your ideas.",
  "So again, we're gonna check out the exact same topic again.",
  "Remember, we're talking about the beach.",
  "This beach right here is absolutely beautiful topic.",
  "Beach question.",
  "What do you and your friends normally do at the beach?.",
  "Simple response?.",
  "We normally play in the water, but now we need reasons.",
  "Reason.",
  "Number one, the water is absolutely beautiful.",
  "Reason number two, it's a combination of exercise and relaxation and reason.",
  "Number three, we all swim very well.",
  "Same question, same topic, but now we're using three reasons to support our answer and give a fluent English response.",
  "So how do these three reasons turn into affluent English response?.",
  "Here we go.",
  "Here's the English response right here.",
  "You know, my friends and I really enjoy playing in the water when we go to the beach.",
  "One of the main reasons, uh, we enjoy playing in the water so much is because the water is absolutely.",
  "Beautiful.",
  "Another reason is that playing in the water is a combination of exercise and relaxation.",
  "So it's really a win-win situation for us.",
  "Finally, since we all swim very well, we are able to stay in the water for a long time.",
  "This is a fluent English.",
  "Using three reasons.",
  "Again, the simple rule of threes will transform your English speaking ability.",
  "Now you'll notice there are three things, three words that I want to explain to you.",
  "The first one is absolutely good.",
  "One more time after me.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Last time after me.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Great job now.",
  "Absolutely just means completely or totally with no qualification restriction or limitation or totally.",
  "So in my response, I said, absolutely beautiful.",
  "Meaning listen, totally beautiful.",
  "There's no question about how beautiful it is.",
  "And again, we saw the beach.",
  "It was very beautiful.",
  "So in English you can add absolutely.",
  "When you want to say that something is completely or totally true.",
  "Now the next one is also a very good one.",
  "I said, combination.",
  "Could again after me combination.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Last time after me combination.",
  "Great job.",
  "Now, combination, this word just means adjoin or merging of different parts or qualities in which the component elements are individually distinct.",
  "Right?.",
  "So they both have their own individual characteristics, but then they come together.",
  "Combin.",
  "And remember in my response, I said a combination of exercise and relaxation to separate things that come together when we play in the water at the beach.",
  "Now, the last one I want to explain to you is when win.",
  "That was easy, right?.",
  "Again, after me, when, when.",
  "Excellent last time.",
  "Win, win.",
  "Great job.",
  "Now this literally just means when you're speaking about a situation in which both parties, right?.",
  "Each individual benefits in some way, this is a win, win situation.",
  "You got money and I got money.",
  "You got food.",
  "And I got food in this situation.",
  "We are all very happy.",
  "Now I said in my response that going to the beach and playing in the water is a win-win situation.",
  "We get to exercise and we get to relax and you'll also get to hang out with your friends, a win-win situation.",
  "Makes sense.",
  "Right.",
  "All right.",
  "So again, we were able to give a fluent English response using three again, very good.",
  "Three reasons explaining why we actually enjoy spending time together at the beach.",
  "With our friends.",
  "Now, I really hope this lesson helped you out a lot.",
  "This rule will really change your English, but don't forget if you want to continue studying with me.",
  "Don't forget to go to www.dailyenglishlessons.com.",
  "I have lessons prepared for you that will help you go from the intermediate level all the way to the advanced level.",
  "In one year, I will talk to you next time, but as always remember to speak English.",
  "Do do, do you still there?.",
  "you know what time it is?.",
  "It's story time.",
  "I said story time.",
  "all right.",
  "So I want to tell you a story about something that happened to me in South Korea now.",
  "This situation helped me learn a lot about myself.",
  "So I've told you before that I enjoy hiking.",
  "I love being out in nature.",
  "So one, uh, weekend my friends had actually come to visit me in Korea.",
  "They came from America and they were staying with me.",
  "They were with me for about a week and a half.",
  "And one weekend we decided to go hiking.",
  "We went to Suda mountain, a very popular mountain in Korea, a very beautiful mountain.",
  "It actually is my favorite mountain.",
  "My favorite place to go in South Korea.",
  "Now, the reason I love the mountain so much is because the views are absolutely amazing.",
  "You remember it right?.",
  "Absolutely amazing.",
  "So I remember this, like it was yesterday.",
  "So my best friend and I, we were climbing up the mountain.",
  "Our other two friends were on a different side, walking around and sitting down, but I wanted to go to the very top of the mountain to get a picture.",
  "And my best friend said, okay, TIFF, I'll join you.",
  "So we were walking up the mountain now it was very steep, but I was not scared at all.",
  "And I thought my best friend was just coming along and that she wasn't scared.",
  "So we're going up the mountain.",
  "And I looked behind me and noticed that my best friend was a little further back than I thought she would be.",
  "So I kind of stopped and waited for her.",
  "And she finally caught up to me and I said, are you okay?.",
  "You wanna keep going?.",
  "And I could tell by the look in her eyes, That this was not what she wanted to do.",
  "And I asked her, I said, are you scared?.",
  "And she said, T I'm not gonna lie to you.",
  "Yes, I'm absolutely terrified.",
  "I said, okay, listen.",
  "It's okay.",
  "You don't have to keep going.",
  "You can stay right here and I'll come back and meet you.",
  "Now, remember I said, this situation taught me a lot about myself.",
  "I literally was not afraid at all.",
  "And it was extremely high.",
  "I wanted to get the picture.",
  "So I continued going up the mountain to get to the very top.",
  "It took me about 10 or 15 more minutes to get to where I needed to be.",
  "And I left my friend behind me.",
  "My other friends were down there as well.",
  "So it was okay.",
  "So I got to the very top and it got to a spot.",
  "You couldn't walk anymore.",
  "You had to basically get on your hands and knees to climb to the top.",
  "It didn't stop me.",
  "I put my camera in my pocket and I continued climbing.",
  "And again, remember I said, this situation taught me a lot about myself.",
  "I got to the very top.",
  "Now the wind was blowing.",
  "It was very high.",
  "If you had a, if you made one wrong, You'd basically fall off the mountain.",
  "It was very high.",
  "So I got to the very top and there actually was a couple and they were kind of sitting close to the mountain and they looked at me and I of kin spoken Korean and I said, hi.",
  "I was like, do you mind taking a picture for me?.",
  "And they said, sure.",
  "So I handed them the camera and I was standing and to stand, I had to take my hands off of the mountain.",
  "And when I took my hands off of the mountain and realized where I was, I looked around and I said, this is why my friend was scared.",
  "I still wasn't scared, but it was extremely high and the wind was blowing.",
  "So they took the picture really quickly.",
  "And when I took the camera back from them, I thought to myself, man, this is really how my life has been.",
  "I have to go up many different things.",
  "I have to, uh, basically I have many challenges that I'm trying to overcome.",
  "I'm going through many different trials or many different situations.",
  "And instead of being scared, I focus on the goal.",
  "Now this is something that was instilled in me from my parents.",
  "Things may get hard, but you keep moving forward and focus on the end goal and not what's going on around you.",
  "And I'd say this story to you all.",
  "This is what has made me, who I am today, your English teacher, getting to the point right now, where I am here in front of the camera.",
  "Speaking to you, helping you achieve your goals.",
  "The reason I am so passionate about helping you achieve your goals is because I've had to go through many challenges along my life journey, learning Korean, failing exams, again, failing over and over and trying to do so many things, but always focusing on the.",
  "And I realize the importance of keeping your focus no matter what's going on around you.",
  "If you fall, if you stumble, if there's something dangerous, again, keeping your focus on your goal.",
  "And my goal as your English teacher is to help you focus on your goal.",
  "Don't get discouraged.",
  "Things are going to happen.",
  "You might fail.",
  "You may not pass the aisle L to exam the first time you may not pass the, the other English test.",
  "You have to pass the first time.",
  "But if you focus on your goal, you will achieve your goal.",
  "And when you get there, look around and see how far you've come.",
  "So I want you to say encouraged as you're on this English journey, never, ever give.",
  "Stay encouraged.",
  "Remember that I'm here to help you.",
  "And I hope you enjoyed this story time.",
  "I'll talk to you next time."
