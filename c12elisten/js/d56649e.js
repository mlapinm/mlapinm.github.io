  "have so much trouble living together.",
  "really why.",
  "he is slobby and unorganized.",
  "we just can't get along we have nothing in common.",
  "and his annoying behaviors are driving me crazy.",
  "how bad is he.",
  "for example it's one thing to leave his shoes and socks on his bedroom floor.",
  "that is his own private space after all.",
  "but don't be a slob in shared spaces like the kitchen or living room.",

  "that can be exhausting and overwhelming for me.",
  "you can set up some limits to when you talk to him.",
  "and how long he will be around him.",
  "trust me you feel so much better.",
  "he is also an attention seeker.",
  "he will do anything for attention including talking about me behind my back.",
  "sharing my personal information with others.",
  "you should let him know his behavior is causing a rift.",
  "hopefully he'll hear you out and reevaluate his actions.",
  "i hope so.",
  "roommates can be lifelong friends.",
  "but they can be a nightmare.",
  "so what will you do when you go back to your dorm.",
  "people usually think moving rooms.",
  "or changing roommates will be the magic solution to all their problems.",
  "but learning how to deal with situations you have with your roommate can benefit you your entire life.",
  "i think roommate problems are caused by miscommunications.",
  "and the problem can be solved just by sitting down with a neutral friend and talking things out.",
  "you are going to college next year.",
