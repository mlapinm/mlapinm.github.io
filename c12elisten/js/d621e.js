  "Different climates.",
  "The climate is different in different parts of the world.",
  "People build different homes depending on the climate.",
  "In temperate climates the weather is usually mild.",
  "Homes are often built with bricks.",
  "Bricks keep water out and keep the homes dry.",
  "Homes often have large windows to let the sun in and a chimney so people can light a fire when it's cold.",
  "Where it rains a lot people build houses with sloping roofs so that all the water runs off and doesn't get into their houses."
