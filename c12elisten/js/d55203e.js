  "Why do you need a resume?.",
  "Because there's a lot of competition in the job market.",
  "Jobseekers need to create a resume that really shows their qualifications to an employer.",
  "A great resume is really important for three main reasons.",
  "First, a great resume will get the attention of the employers and show why you are a good match for the job.",
  "Employers will read many resumes from many different applicants.",
  "So you need to make sure that your resume clearly stands out to get the attention of the employer.",
  "Remember that your qualifications should match the job advertisement.",
  "If the company is looking for someone with five years of sales experience, you should have five years, or more, of sales experience, and say that clearly in your resume.",
  "The second reason you need a great resume is that it communicates your strongest skills and accomplishments to a future employer.",
  "Your resume should highlight the skills that employers often look for, such as technology skills and communication skills.",
  "Your resume should also include professional accomplishments or activities.",
  "For example, if you wrote a book that was published, you should put that in your resume.",
  "The third, and most important, reason you need a great resume is that it gets you an interview.",
  "Your resume is your first chance to get the employer attention.",
  "Job seekers want to leave the reader with a positive first impression or a good feeling.",
  "If the employer likes what they read they will contact you to interview for the job.",
  "The interview is your chance to meet the employer in person and give more details about your qualifications.",
  "In summary, a resume is an important document that describes your work experience, education and skills.",
  "There are 3 reasons why you need a great resume.",
  "To get the employer's attention and show you are a good match.",
