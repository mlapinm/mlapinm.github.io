  "Hi guys.",
  "Welcome back to English with Max.",
  "In this video I'm going to teach you some cat-related vocabulary.",
  "This is my cat Monty and he is going to help me throughout this video.",
  "Okay, guys, so I have some treats in my hand so that Monty stays here.",
  "Are you going to be a good model, Monty?.",
  "- (Mum) So he doesn't run away.",
  "So he doesn't run away, yeah.",
  "And Mum's helping me film.",
  "Well, Mom is actually holding the camera.",
  "She is filming.",
  "Okay, so these are Monty's whiskers.",
  "So the bits of... kind of like hair that come out here.",
  "Those are whiskers.",
  "One whisker.",
  "Two whiskers.",
  "Sometimes we do find one whisker on the ground, so sometimes you do say \"one whisker\". Okay, these are paws.",
  "For animals you can say paws or legs.",
  "The paw is... The paw's normally the, like, front part, right?.",
  "Yeah, so... - (Mum) Like the fingers.",
  "A bit like... They're a bit like the hand... The hand with the \"fingers\". We don't say \"hands\" and \"fingers\" for animals, just like we don't say \"arms\" for animals.",
  "We say: \"Mont has four legs.\" Okay, you can have another one.",
  "There you go.",
  "Sometimes we, by accident, say \"Monty's arms\", but you can't actually say that.",
  "This is a collar.",
  "Collar.",
  "Monty has two bells on his collar so that we always know where he is.",
  "He's actually... there you go, there you go... He's an indoor cat.",
  "We keep him inside.",
  "A lot of indoor cats don't have collars, but we want to know where he is, because sometimes you hide, don't you?.",
  "Yeah and it's hard to find you.",
  "And sometimes he hides and then jumps out at us.",
  "Now that is Monty's tail.",
  "Monty likes to chase his tail.",
  "So that's when an animal is running around in circles.",
  "Often it's because they're chasing their tail.",
  "This is Monty's fur.",
  "It's actually more common to say \"cat hair\" than \"cat fur\", but you will hear both.",
  "Fur is the same as hair, but we say it when an animal has lots of hair close together.",
  "Humans, for example, don't have fur.",
  "At least, we don't... we don't say that.",
  "And if you have, you know, bits of... like that... hair... bits of cat hair on your clothes, you wouldn't say \"fur\" either.",
  "You would say \"cat hair\". When animals lose their hair, we say they're shedding.",
  "To shed hair.",
  "At the end of his paws he has claws.",
  "One claw.",
  "Two claws.",
  "They're the sharp, sort of like nails at the end of his feet.",
  "And every now and then we have to cut them.",
  "We have special scissors for... for cutting his claws.",
  "It doesn't hurt, though.",
  "It's just so... It's just so they're not too sharp and he can't scratch us too much.",
  "Another piece of vocabulary: That noise that he is making is called \"purring\". The verb is to purr.",
  "You're purring, aren't you, Monty?.",
  "Another sound that cats make is meowing - to miaow.",
  "So often if we're imitating a cat, we sometimes say \"meow meow\". Did I annoy you?.",
  "I don't want to annoy Monty because he can get a bit... a bit feisty sometimes.",
  "Oh no, he's licking me.",
  "That's because I had food in my hand.",
  "Oh yes, something else.",
  "Monty is a rescue cat.",
  "We got Monty at the RSPCA which is the main organisation in Australia that fights against cruelty towards animals, and where you often go if you want to adopt a pet.",
  "So if you want to adopt a dog or a cat, most of the time.",
  "And you already had a name, didn't you, Monty?.",
  "Yeah, Monty was already Monty so we left it as that.",
  "Yeah.",
  "You were four months old.",
  "Monty was four months old when we got him.",
  "Is he about to bite?.",
  "\"Now Monty's biting.\" No, he's not gonna bite me because he thinks I still have food.",
  "Now I'm going to show you some of Monty's things.",
  "That there is his feeding tower.",
  "Hello Monty.",
  "The reason we put his food in a feeding tower is because otherwise he sometimes eats too quickly and makes himself sick.",
  "But this way he eats slowly.",
  "It also means he has to work for it a little bit and he doesn't eat too much.",
  "So this is cat food.",
  "Some people call this dry cat food and some people call it kibble.",
  "That there is Monty's water bowl.",
  "You gonna have a drink?.",
  "That there is one of Monty's beds, but obviously he just sleeps wherever he feels like.",
  "We're actually in the laundry.",
  "That's the washing machine.",
  "We put Monty in here at night so that he doesn't jump on us while we're sleeping or miaow at our doors.",
  "Isn't that right, Monty?.",
  "He doesn't care.",
  "Okay.",
  "That is another one of Monty's beds and those are Monty's friends.",
  "That's Baby Frank.",
  "Over here we have the kitty litter.",
  "This is where Monty does his business.",
  "Thanks very much for watching, guys.",
  "If you have any questions, just write them in the comments, and also tell me what you think of cats and whether you're more a cat person or a dog person.",
  "Bye guys!.",
  "I'm actually more a dog person, but Monty's technically Mum's cat, so yeah, I didn't have much of a choice.",
  "Okay, let's maybe start again, huh?.",
  "Shall we start again, Monty?.",
  "Do you want the last one, Monty?.",
  "Here you go.",
  "Is that it, do you think?.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueYyxNHM_Ww&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=19\">Is that it, do you think?</a>",
  "Hi guys.",
  "Welcome back to English with Max.",
  "In this video you are going to learn 10 advanced adjectives to help you avoid using the word \"very\". Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with the word \"very\". I know I use it very frequently, but it gets a bit boring if you use it constantly.",
  "Before we begin, if you would like to learn more advanced vocabulary, make sure you sign up for my free advanced English email lessons.",
  "I send them out every two weeks and you can unsubscribe at any time.",
  "You'll find the link in the description.",
  "Let's first look at the words and their meanings.",
  "After that we will practise them in sentences.",
  "I will also give you some time to repeat the sentences after me so you can practise your pronunciation.",
  "The first word is spotless.",
  "Spotless.",
  "This means very clean.",
  "Pay attention to how the T is pronounced in the middle of the word.",
  "It's a very soft T.",
  "We don't usually say \"spoT-less\". We say \"spotless\". Spotless.",
  "The opposite of very clean is obviously very dirty.",
  "Instead of very dirty, you can say filthy.",
  "The kitchen was filthy.",
  "Now let's look at very bad.",
  "You probably already know some words that mean very bad, like horrible or terrible, but a word that many non-natives don't know is atrocious.",
  "Atrocious.",
  "You could say, for example: That movie was atrocious.",
  "Another way to say very painful is excruciating.",
  "Excruciating.",
  "Let's break that down.",
  "Ex-cru-ci-a-ting.",
  "Excruciating.",
  "Number five.",
  "Instead of saying very wet, you can say soaked.",
  "Soaked.",
  "We normally use it for things that absorb water very easily, for example, clothes or towels.",
  "But you can also use it for people.",
  "Like: I forgot my umbrella so I was soaked by the time I got home.",
  "If you want to say that someone has a lot of money, you can say that they are very rich.",
  "Another way to say this is wealthy.",
  "Wealthy.",
  "And now a couple of words to talk about the weather.",
  "Instead of saying very cold, you can say freezing.",
  "It's freezing outside.",
  "The opposite is of course very hot.",
  "Another way to say this is boiling.",
  "It's boiling outside.",
  "We also often put \"hot\" after \"boiling\". Like: It's boiling hot today.",
  "Number nine.",
  "Instead of saying very hungry, we can say ravenous.",
  "Ravenous.",
  "And finally, instead of using very old, we can use ancient.",
  "Ancient.",
  "You can use this for things or for people.",
  "That computer is ancient.",
  "My economics professor is ancient.",
  "Now let's look at all of these words in sentences.",
  "This part is extremely important because it will help you to remember the words and it's a good opportunity for you to practise your pronunciation.",
  "I will pause after each sentence so you have time to repeat it after me.",
  "It might help to watch the movement of my lips.",
  "I hope there's no food in my teeth.",
  "Number one: George's room is always spotless.",
  "Now you say it.",
  "Again: George's room is always spotless.",
  "Number two: Frank's room, on the other hand, is usually filthy.",
  "Again: Frank's room, on the other hand, is usually filthy.",
  "And in case you don't know who Frank and George are... This is George and this is Frank.",
  "Number three: He's a good writer, but his spelling is atrocious.",
  "Did you notice how I said \"but his\"? I didn't pronounce the H.",
  "I actually said \"but-is\". \"But-is\". One more time.",
  "He's a good writer, but his spelling is atrocious.",
  "Number four: When I had appendicitis, the pain was excruciating.",
  "When I had appendicitis, the pain was excruciating.",
  "My shoes were soaked after I walked home in the rain.",
  "My shoes were soaked after I walked home in the rain.",
  "Number six: She's become an incredibly wealthy woman.",
  "Again: She's become an incredibly wealthy woman.",
  "Number seven: Can you turn on the heater?.",
  "It's freezing in here.",
  "Can you turn on the heater?.",
  "It's freezing in here.",
  "Number eight: You should wear light clothes because it's going to be boiling today.",
  "You should wear light clothes because it's going to be boiling today.",
  "Number nine: I haven't eaten all day and I'm ravenous.",
  "I haven't eaten all day and I'm ravenous.",
  "And now the final sentence: Some people say that my phone's ancient because it's now two years old.",
  "Some people say that my phone's ancient because it's now 2 years old.",
  "If you would like to practise using these words, create your own sentences and write them in the comments.",
  "If you are new to my channel, don't forget to subscribe and remember that you can also follow me on social media.",
  "See you next time.",
  "Number nine... My butt hurts... ... don't... If you would like to...",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDKLG5HwBKk&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=18\">Number nine... My butt hurts... ... don't... If you would like to...</a>",
  "Hi guys.",
  "Welcome back to English with Max.",
  "Today we are going to learn some bathroom vocabulary.",
  "This isn't actually my bathroom.",
  "This is my parents' bathroom.",
  "It's the main bathroom in my parents' house.",
  "My bathroom is a little smaller, so I thought this one would be a bit more interesting.",
  "Okay, so we'll start with the mirror.",
  "That's me in the mirror... obviously.",
  "And below we have the bathroom sink.",
  "So this space here is the sink and this is the tap.",
  "That's for the cold water.",
  "That's for the hot water.",
  "That is hand soap, okay?.",
  "So we call this hand soap because it's specifically for our hands (when we wash our hands). I think that's pretty logical.",
  "Okay, here we have some tissues.",
  "In American English they're normally called Kleenex, because Kleenex is a very popular brand of tissue.",
  "There we have a fake plant.",
  "My mum used to have lots of real plants, but she got a bit tired of maintaining them, so now we have some quite realistic-looking fake plants.",
  "Okay, over here we have a brush.",
  "This is a nail brush.",
  "These are... Well, I call them Q-tips, but there are a few different words for these.",
  "Here we have some toothpaste.",
  "I'm sure you know what that is for.",
  "Toothpaste.",
  "Here we have a toothbrush.",
  "It's a regular toothbrush.",
  "And here we have an electric toothbrush.",
  "Some people like to joke about these and they'll say that these can be used for more than one thing because they vibrate.",
  "I'm not passing any judgment, but in case you're wondering mine is just used to clean my teeth.",
  "This is moisturiser for the face.",
  "This is also moisturiser, but this is tinted moisturiser.",
  "It's also called BB cream, okay?.",
  "Now it's called tinted moisturiser because it has some colour in it.",
  "It makes you look like you have a bit of a tan.",
  "This is also moisturiser.",
  "(clears throat) Excuse me.",
  "It's also moisturiser, but it's for the hands and the body.",
  "It's probably very similar to this, but well... I guess they figure they can make more money if they put a different word on the label.",
  "Here we have a night light.",
  "This is quite clever because even though it's plugged in and the power is turned on, it detects that there is light, so it is off.",
  "But when it's dark, it comes back on.",
  "In Australia we normally have switches next to power or on power outlets.",
  "So right at the power point.",
  "It's just an extra safety feature.",
  "So that means there'll be no power and with that the power is on.",
  "What else?.",
  "Here we have a towel.",
  "This is called a hand towel because... da da da da!.",
  "We use it to dry our hands.",
  "And be careful of the pronunciation.",
  "We don't usually say hanD Towel.",
  "We link it and we say hand towel.",
  "Hand towel.",
  "Down there we have a bin.",
  "There's nothing in it at the moment because I just emptied it, but yeah, that's a bin.",
  "Ah yes!.",
  "And down here we have a hairdryer.",
  "Hairdryer.",
  "That down there is a bath mat, okay?.",
  "And on the floor these are tiles.",
  "Tiles.",
  "There're also some tiles on the wall, for example, these.",
  "These are tiles.",
  "Okay and there we have the toilet.",
  "Next to the toilet is the toilet brush, and that is a toilet roll holder.",
  "Okay?.",
  "It holds toilet rolls.",
  "It holds toilet paper.",
  "Okay.",
  "Toilet paper.",
  "Very useful stuff.",
  "Here we have a bath.",
  "So you could call this a bath or you could call it a bathtub.",
  "So bath or bathtub.",
  "That's a soap holder, so normally there's soap in there... This is a plug.",
  "This is what we put in here if you... if we want to have a bath.",
  "This is a hose... So a bit different to the hose... to the types of hoses that we have in gardens, but we would also call this a hose.",
  "Maybe a shower hose or a bath hose.",
  "Okay... This is a regular towel.",
  "So this is... You could just call it a towel or if you want to be specific, you could call it a bath towel.",
  "Here we have the shower... This shower is... Well, it's particularly big.",
  "I think it's a little bit excessive (we don't really need showers this big), but... I don't know, I didn't design the house and neither did my parents.",
  "This is a walk-in shower because you walk into it and it's flat - you can walk around.",
  "Some showers are, like, in bathtubs.",
  "We wouldn't call those walk-in showers.",
  "These are doors.",
  "More specifically they are glass sliding doors 'cos they slide.",
  "It's now apparently illegal to make shower doors with this type of material.",
  "In other words, glass with small pieces of wire because if you fall, it's... it can cause more damage.",
  "Um, yeah.",
  "But this house was built in the 1980s so we still have that.",
  "Okay, what else?.",
  "Okay, hot water, cold water.",
  "We call this the shower head.",
  "Shower head.",
  "Here we have a rack... This here (this brown stuff) is rust, because obviously if you have metal that is exposed to water very frequently, often it will rust.",
  "\"To rust\" and the noun is \"rust\". And the adjective is \"rusty\". Here we have some soap in the soap holder.",
  "This is a face washer.",
  "So we wouldn't call this a face towel, we would call this a washer or a face washer.",
  "I'm sure you know these words.",
  "This is shampoo and this is conditioner.",
  "Be careful of the pronunciation.",
  "It's not con-ditioner.",
  "It's conditioner.",
  "The first vowel is a schwa.",
  "Conditioner.",
  "Conditioner.",
  "And that is some face wash.",
  "And that is another bath mat.",
  "Oh yes, and I forgot about this.",
  "This is a shower cap.",
  "Something you can put over your hair if you don't want it to get wet when you're having a bath or a shower.",
  "That's it, guys.",
  "I hope you found this useful.",
  "If you would like me to do more videos of things around the house, just let me know in the comments.",
  "See you next time, guys!."
