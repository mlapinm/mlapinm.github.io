  "Sometimes, a person writes a  book all about his or her life.",
  "These books are normally very boring.  This is not one of those books. I.",
  "do not want to write everything about me. But some things happened to me in my early life,.",
  "and I did not forget them. They are not important,  but I remember them fifty or sixty years later.",
  "Some things are funny. Some things  are not nice. All of them are true.",
  "CHAPTER ONE The start  My father, Harald Dahl, was Norwegian.  He came from a small town near Oslo.",
  "in Norway. His father - my grandfather  - had a shop in the town. People went.",
  "to the shop to buy food and things for their  houses. The shop had nearly everything!.",
  "At the age of fourteen, my father had  an accident and badly hurt his arm.",
  "A doctor came, but he was not a good doctor.  He hurt my father's arm more, and then.",
  "the arm had to be cut from my father's body. My father had only one arm,.",
  "but he learned to do lots of things with  it. He made one side of a fork into a knife.",
  "because he wanted to cut his own food. He took his  special fork everywhere with him in a little bag.",
  "My father lived in a small town,  but he wanted to see the world.",
  "He finished school and got a job on a ship.  It took him to Calais in France. From there,.",
  "he went to Paris. In Paris, my father met  a young woman called Marie and married her.",
  "At that time, many ships travelled across  the world, and they needed fuel, food.",
  "and thousands of other things. My father  started a company that had all these things.",
  "The ships bought everything they needed from  his company, and my father made a lot of money.",
  "He took his family to Wales because Cardiff  was an important city for ships. My father.",
  "and Marie had two children (a girl  and a boy), but then Marie sadly died.",
  "My father was sad, and he wanted a new  wife. In 1911, he went on holiday to Norway.",
  "There, he met a young Norwegian woman called Sofie  and married her. They had four more children:.",
  "two girls, a boy (me, in 1916) and a third girl.  Now they had a happy family with six children.",
  "We all lived together in a big house in Wales,  in a village eight miles west of Cardiff.",
  "We had chickens, cows and horses. Our big family was very happy. But.",
  "then my sister Astri got an illness, and  she died. She was only seven years old.",
  "My father got a different  illness, and he died, too.",
  "Maybe he did not fight his illness because  he was very sad about Astri. Today,.",
  "these illnesses do not often kill people. Doctors  can give people something to make them better,.",
  "but, in 1920, doctors could not help my family. Now my mother had five children, a new baby and no.",
  "husband. She was a young Norwegian in a strange  country, and her family were all in Norway.",
  "But my mother stayed in the United Kingdom  because my father wanted his children.",
  "to go to school in England. \"English schools are  the best schools in the world,\" he always said.",
  "I do not remember a lot from my earliest  years, but I can remember one thing very well:.",
  "my tricycle. A tricycle is a bike for  small children, but it has three wheels.",
  "My sister and I loved to ride our tricycles  as fast as we could in the middle of the road.",
  "It felt good to go very fast.   We could ride in the road because  there were not many cars in those days.",
  "CHAPTER TWO The sweet shop  In 1923, I was seven years old, and I started  school. Every day, my friends and I walked about.",
  "a mile to school, and we went past a sweet shop.  And, every day, we stopped and looked at all the.",
  "wonderful sweets in their jars. Sometimes  we had money, and we could buy some sweets.",
  "But there was one problem. A bad woman worked  in the shop. Her name was Mrs Pratchett.",
  "Mrs Pratchett was a small, ugly old woman.  She never smiled, and she was never friendly.",
  "She always shouted at us, \"I'm watching you!\" or  \"You have to buy something or you must go away!\".",
  "She was also very dirty. Her clothes always had  egg and bread and tea from her breakfast on them.",
  "Her hands were grey and dirty,  and her fingers were black.",
  "And she put these dirty hands  into the jars of sweets!.",
  "Of course, this did not stop us from buying  the sweets. But we did not like Mrs Pratchett.",
  "At school, my friends and I found a small  place under the floor. We kept our sweets.",
  "and other special things in it. One day,  we found something new there: a dead mouse!.",
  "\"I have a plan,\" I said. \"Let's put it  in one of Mrs Pratchett's sweet jars.",
  "She will put her dirty hand in the  jar, and she will find a dead mouse!\".",
  "\"Yes!\" my friends said. \"We  will do it today You must put.",
  "the mouse in the jar, because it's your plan.\" \"I will ask for some yellow sweets,\" my friend.",
  "Thwaites said. \"They are at the back of the shop.  Mrs Pratchett will turn and get them. Then you.",
  "can quickly put the mouse in the jar with the  pink sweets in it. It's the nearest one to us.\".",
  "That afternoon, we walked into the shop. We were  all very excited. Thwaites asked for his sweets,.",
  "and Mrs Pratchett got them for him. I quickly  put the mouse in the jar with the pink sweets.",
  "Then Mrs Pratchett looked at  us with her ugly little eyes.",
  "\"Only one of you is buying sweets. I don't  want you all in here!\" she shouted. \"Go away!\".",
  "We ran outside. \"Did you put it  in the jar?\" asked my friends.",
  "\"Of course I did!\" I said. I was happy, and my friends were happy, too.",
  "\"You were great,\" they said.  The next morning, we walked past the shop and  saw a message on the door. The shop was closed.",
  "We stopped. The shop was never  closed at this time in the morning.",
  "We looked through the window. The jar was on the  floor, and there was broken glass everywhere.",
  "The mouse was on the floor, too.  But we could not see Mrs Pratchett.",
  "Something was very wrong! \"Mrs Pratchett had a shock,\".",
  "Thwaites said. \"Shocks can hurt old  people. Bad things happen to them.\".",
  "\"What?\" we said. \"What happens to them?\" \"Their bodies stop, and they die,\" Thwaites said.",
  "Then he said to me, \"You killed her.\" \"Me?\" I said. \"Why only me?\".",
  "\"It was your plan,\" Thwaites said.  \"And you put the mouse in the jar.\".",
  "I was a killer! At school, I felt bad.",
  "\"I am only eight years old,\" I thought,  because I wanted to feel better.",
  "\"No little boy of eight kills  anyone. It's not possible.\".",
  "The teachers sent everyone outside. I waited  for the police to come and take me away.",
  "Mr Coombes, the headmaster, came outside with a  woman. It was Mrs Pratchett! She was not dead! I.",
  "was not a killer! The old woman looked at all the  boys, and she pointed a dirty finger at Thwaites.",
  "\"That's him!\" she shouted. \"That's one of them!\" Everyone in the school looked at Thwaites.",
  "\"That's one, too!\" she said.  She pointed a finger at me.",
  "Then she pointed at our three other friends. My four friends and I went to the headmaster's.",
  "room. It smelled of tobacco. Mr Coombes was a  very tall man, and in his hands, he held a long,.",
  "yellow cane. I was very frightened of him and  his cane. Mrs Pratchett was in the room, too,.",
  "because she wanted to watch! \"You,\" said Mr Coombes.",
  "He pointed the cane at Thwaites. \"Come here.\" Thwaites walked very slowly. He put his hands.",
  "on the floor, and the headmaster hit his  bottom with the cane. It made a loud noise.",
  "Little Thwaites flew in the air. \"Ow-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w!\" he shouted.",
  "\"Harder!\" shouted Mrs Pratchett. The headmaster hit Thwaites four times.",
  "We had to watch and wait. After all the other boys, it was me.",
  "I put my hands on the floor. I heard the noise  first and felt nothing. Then I felt the cane.",
  "My bottom was on fire. I breathed out very  hard, and there was no air left in my body.",
  "The second time, the cane hit me in  the same place, and it hurt a lot more.",
  "After four times, it was time to go, but it  was difficult to walk. My bottom was on fire,.",
  "and I held it with my hands. \"Thank you, Headmaster,\".",
  "said Mrs Pratchett, happily. \"There will not  be any more dead mice in my sweet jars now.\".",
  "CHAPTER THREE Summer holidays  Summer holidays! What wonderful words.  Every summer, from the age of four to.",
  "seventeen years old, was wonderful. We  always went to Norway for our holidays.",
  "Norway was home for us because my family was  Norwegian, and we all spoke the language.",
  "We were always a big group of ten or more people.  There were my three sisters and my very old.",
  "half-sister (that is four people). There was my  half-brother and me (that is six). There was my.",
  "mother (seven) and someone to help (eight). Two or  more friends of my very old half-sister came, too.",
  "In those days, there were no planes. It took four  days to go to our holiday in Norway. We went by.",
  "train, taxi, a second train, a second  taxi, ship and then in a small boat.",
  "We always went to Oslo first. We stayed one night  in a hotel and visited our mother's parents.",
  "My grandmother was a very old woman  with white hair. My grandfather.",
  "was very quiet. He always sat in a chair  and smoked tobacco from a very long pipe.",
  "After the visit to my grandparents, we travelled  to a little island. Its name was Tjome, and it was.",
  "the best place on Earth. We went to the beach  there. We swam in the sea and lay in the sun.",
  "We went to other islands in our little boat and  ate fish from the sea. They were wonderful days.",
  "I remember only one bad thing  about our holidays in Norway.",
  "One year, my mother said, \"We are going to the  doctor. He wants to look at your nose and mouth.\".",
  "\"What's wrong with my nose and mouth?\"  I asked. I was about eight years old.",
  "\"Not a lot,\" my mother said.  \"But I think you have adenoids.\".",
  "\"What are adenoids?\" I asked her. \"Don't worry,\" she said. \"It's nothing.\".",
  "The doctor looked up my nose and in  my mouth. I did not worry, because.",
  "I was too young to understand. Someone held a bowl under my face.",
  "The doctor had a very long knife. He put it  in hot water over a fire to make it clean.",
  "\"Open your mouth,\" said the  doctor. But I did not want to.",
  "\"It will be quick,\" he said. I opened my mouth.",
  "The doctor's knife went into my mouth. It  moved very quickly. The doctor turned it.",
  "four or five times. Something red went from  my mouth into the bowl. It was a shock!.",
  "\"Those are your adenoids,\" said the doctor.  He pointed at the red things in the bowl.",
  "The top of my mouth was on fire. I held my  mother's hand. How could someone do this to me?.",
  "\"You will breathe more  easily now,\" said the doctor.",
  "My mother and I walked home. Yes, I  said walk. There was no bus or car.",
  "We walked for thirty minutes. We got home to my  grandparents' house, and someone gave me a chair.",
  "\"He can rest there for a few  minutes,\" my grandparents said.",
  "This was in 1924. It was normal to cut a child's  adenoids with no anaesthetic in those days!.",
  "CHAPTER FOUR Boarding school  In September 1925, I was nine years old, and  it was time for me to go to boarding school.",
  "Children stay the night at boarding school  and live there without their families.",
  "St Peter's School in Somerset was the nearest  English boarding school to our house in Wales,.",
  "but it was across fifteen miles of sea.  This sea was called the Bristol Channel.",
  "For school, my mother gave me a very  special new box. It was called a tuck box.",
  "Every child at boarding school has a tuck  box. They are always closed with a key,.",
  "and no teacher can look inside them. Boys keep  food, toys and other special things in them. At.",
  "St Peter's, one boy kept a frog in his tuck box! My mother travelled to St Peter's School with me.",
  "We went to Cardiff in a taxi and  then across the water by boat.",
  "On the English side, we went in a second taxi  to the school. I had a new school uniform.",
  "All my clothes were new, and  everything had my name on it.",
  "St Peter's School was outside the town.  It had beds for 150 boys and rooms.",
  "for the headmaster's family. There was a  lot of grass outside for playing sport.",
  "On the first day there were  many boys and their families   in front of the school. The very tall headmaster  walked from group to group to meet the parents.",
  "\"Goodbye, Mrs Dahl,\" he said, quickly. \"It's  time to go. Don't worry; we will look after him.\".",
  "My mother understood. She said goodbye  to me and left in a taxi. The headmaster.",
  "went to talk to a different family.  I stood there with my new tuck box.",
  "and began to cry. I was sad because I  did not want to live away from my family.",
  "Life at St Peter's School was difficult.  The teachers were not friendly, and I was.",
  "always frightened of the cane. We had to  wash in cold water, and the food was bad.",
  "I wanted to go home and see my family. At night in bed, I always thought about my family.",
  "and tried not to cry. They were across the  Bristol Channel, and I could see the sea.",
  "from my window. I always went to  sleep with my face towards my family.",
  "I never turned my back towards them in bed. Mothers sent their hungry sons food every.",
  "week. This made the headmaster  happy, because food was expensive.",
  "\"Send food as often as you like! Once a week.  Or twice a week!\" the headmaster always said.",
  "\"Your boy gets good food here, but food from home  is always more special. You can send them things.",
  "like fruit and a big cake. You don't want your  child to be the only boy with an empty tuck box.\".",
  "Every Sunday, every boy at St Peter's wrote  to his family. We never wrote about the bad.",
  "things at school. We only told our parents good  things, because the headmaster read our letters.",
  "He saw our bad spelling, but we  could not change it in the letters.",
  "We had to write the words correctly later.",
  "\"No teacher has read this letter,\" our  parents thought, \"because there is bad.",
  "spelling in it. Everything in this letter  must be true! My child is happy at school.\".",
  "I wrote to my mother that first Sunday, and then  I wrote to her every week for thirty-two years.",
  "Sometimes more than once  a week. In 1957, she died,.",
  "and I found more than 600 of my  letters to her. She kept them all.",
  "CHAPTER FIVE A drive in a car  After three long months at boarding  school, it was time for me to go home.",
  "for the Christmas holidays. How  wonderful to be away from school!.",
  "While I was away at St Peter's, my family bought  a car. I was very happy to be home with my.",
  "family, and I was also excited about the  car! In 1925, anyone could drive a car.",
  "You did not need to learn a lot. My very  old half-sister was twenty-one years old.",
  "She had two thirty-minute lessons, and  then she could drive us in our car.",
  "That day, seven of us sat in the car.  In the car were my very old half-sister,.",
  "my half-brother (eighteen years old), my sister  (twelve years old), my mother (forty years old),.",
  "two small sisters (eight and five years old)  and me (nine years old). We were very excited.",
  "\"How fast will it go?\" we asked our very old  half-sister. \"Will it go at fifty miles an hour?\".",
  "\"It can go at sixty miles an hour!\" she answered. \"Oh, let's make it go at sixty!\" we shouted.",
  "\"We will go faster than that,\" she said.  My very old half-sister started the car,  and we drove slowly through the village.",
  "People in the street were excited to see our car. After five minutes, we left the village.",
  "\"You see! I can do it!\" our  very old half-sister said.",
  "\"Go faster!\" we shouted. \"We're only  going at fifteen miles an hour!\".",
  "My half-sister began to make the car  go at about thirty-five miles an hour.",
  "Then we came to a corner in the road. \"Help!\" she shouted.",
  "The car went into the side of the road.  There was broken glass everywhere.",
  "My family were all OK, but I was badly  hurt. My nose was nearly cut from my face.",
  "My very old half-sister drove  the broken car to the doctor.",
  "very slowly, at about four miles an hour. \"Wow!\" said the doctor. \"Look at his nose!\".",
  "\"It hurts,\" I cried. \"Please help him!\" said my mother.",
  "\"Don't worry,\" said the doctor.  \"He will keep his nose.\".",
  "An hour later, the doctor came to our house.   I lay on a table, and someone put something white  from a bottle on my face. It smelled very strong.",
  "I tried to stand, but strong  hands held me down on the table.",
  "\"Good boy,\" said the doctor.  \"Close your eyes and sleep.\".",
  "After eight hours, I woke up, and my nose was  back in its place. My mother gave me a coin.",
  "British coins always have a picture of  the king or queen on them. In those days,.",
  "the king was George V. \"Well done. This is for you,\" she said.",
  "CHAPTER SIX Goat's tobacco  In 1926, my very old half-sister  chose to marry an English doctor.",
  "He came on holiday with us to Norway. My  family always did everything together,.",
  "but now my half-sister only  wanted to be with this man.",
  "She was always with him, and  they did not want to be with us.",
  "My other sisters and I were young - I was only  nine years old - and we did not understand this.",
  "We did not like the young doctor, because he took  our sister from us. But we also did not like him.",
  "because he smoked a pipe. He always had the  pipe in his mouth, and it smelled very bad.",
  "One day on the beach, the young doctor  went swimming. He left his pipe with us.",
  "and did not take it into the sea with him.  Then I saw some goat droppings on  the ground, and I thought of a plan.",
  "I quickly put some of the goat droppings  in the pipe, under the tobacco. The young.",
  "doctor came back and started smoking his pipe.  My half-brother and sisters and I watched him.",
  "\"Ah-h-h-h,\" he said. \"I  love to smoke after a swim,.",
  "and this English tobacco is the best.  It's much better than Norwegian tobacco.\".",
  "The sea was blue and the sun was  bright. It was a beautiful day.",
  "Then we heard a loud shout and watched the young  doctor fly into the air. His pipe flew out of his.",
  "mouth, and his face was the colour of snow. \"Help! Help! My body is on fire!\".",
  "the doctor shouted. My very old half-sister was very frightened.",
  "\"What's wrong? Where does it hurt?\" she cried.  \"Get the boat! Quickly! We must go to hospital!\".",
  "But the young doctor lay on the  ground and breathed in the clean air.",
  "After five minutes, he started to feel better. \"What happened?\" asked my very old half-sister.",
  "\"I don't know,\" said the doctor. \"I know! I know!\" said my.",
  "little sister, excitedly. \"Tell us!\" said my very old half-sister.",
  "\"It's his pipe!\" shouted my little sister. \"What's wrong with my pipe?\" asked the doctor.",
  "\"It had goat droppings in it!\" said  my little sister, and she laughed.",
  "My very old half-sister and the doctor quickly  understood, and they were very angry. The doctor.",
  "stood up. My half-brother, sisters and I  quickly ran away from him into the sea.",
  "CHAPTER SEVEN Repton  In 1929, my mother asked me, \"Do you  want to go to Marlborough or Repton?\".",
  "They were famous and expensive English schools,  but I knew nothing about them other than that.",
  "\"Repton,\" I answered, because it was an  easier word to say than \"Marlborough\".",
  "\"Very well,\" said my mother.  \"You will go to Repton.\".",
  "Repton was a boarding school  in the middle of England.   Every Repton boy wore the same, very strange,  uniform. I wore it, and my sisters laughed at me.",
  "I felt stupid in the clothes for Repton, but in  the street my mother said, \"You look good in your.",
  "school uniform. People can see it. They think you  are important because you go to a famous school.\".",
  "At the station, I saw many boys,  and they all wore the same uniform.",
  "The train took us all away to  Repton. I was thirteen years old.",
  "Lots of strange things happened at Repton  - they did at all English boarding schools.",
  "Older boys were always more important than  younger boys, and a small group of the.",
  "oldest boys were the most important of all. At Repton, we called these boys \"Boazers\".",
  "Boazers told us what to do, and we had  to do it. We cleaned the Boazers' rooms.",
  "and made their fires. We sometimes cooked  their breakfast. Boazers were always right,.",
  "and younger boys were always wrong. On Sundays, two other boys and I had to clean.",
  "our Boazer's room. We cleaned it for hours. We  washed the floor, the windows and the walls.",
  "But the Boazer often found something wrong  with our cleaning, and he hit us with a cane.",
  "A Boazer could stand in any room of  the school and shout about a job. Then.",
  "every young boy had to run to him.  The slowest boy had to do the job.",
  "One snowy morning, I heard a Boazer shout  about a job. I ran as fast as possible, but.",
  "I was the slowest boy to get there. \"Dahl, come here,\" said the Boazer.",
  "His name was Wilberforce.  \"Go and make my toilet warm.\".",
  "At Repton, all the toilets were outside,  and their little rooms had no doors.",
  "In winter, they were very cold.  My job was to sit on the toilet.",
  "before Wilberforce and make it warm for him. I sat on the toilet for fifteen minutes,.",
  "and then Wilberforce came. \"Is it warm?\" he asked me.",
  "\"It's as warm as possible, Wilberforce.\" \"We will see,\" he said.",
  "He sat on the toilet. \"Very good,\" he said. \"Very,  very good. Some boys have cold bottoms. I only use.",
  "boys with warm bottoms. I will not forget you.\" He did not forget me. I always carried a book.",
  "with me because I often had to sit on  Wilberforce's toilet. It was very boring.",
  "In my first winter at Repton, I read many books  by Charles Dickens on Wilberforce's toilet.",
  "Not everything at school was bad. Sometimes all  the boys got a grey box from a company called.",
  "Cadbury's. Cadbury's made wonderful chocolates. Inside the box were twelve different chocolates.",
  "We always knew one of them well,  but eleven of them were new.",
  "There was also paper in the box. Our  job was to try all the chocolates.",
  "and write the good and bad things  about each one on the paper.",
  "Cadbury's plan to ask us about their new  chocolates was a good one. Boys at Repton.",
  "were some of the best chocolate customers in the  world. Who knew more about chocolate than us?!.",
  "How do companies plan their new  chocolates? I loved to think about this.",
  "Many years later, I needed a story for a new book.  I remembered those little boxes of chocolate at.",
  "Repton, and I started to write my book  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.",
  "Sport is very important at English boarding  schools, and we played a lot of it. Happily,.",
  "I was good at sport, and I enjoyed it. Playing  sport helped to make the long days shorter.",
  "Life at school was easier for good sportsmen,  but it was difficult for bad sportsmen.",
  "My favourite sport was a very fast  game with a ball. It was called Fives.",
  "Because I was one of the best at Fives  at Repton, I travelled to other boarding.",
  "schools and played it with their boys. I also  played football and a ball game called squash.",
  "At school, I loved taking photos.  Today, cameras are very easy to use,.",
  "but in the 1920s they were difficult work.  I had a big, heavy camera with glass plates.",
  "I made a darkroom near the school's music  rooms, and I made many photos there.",
  "\"After school, do you want to study at Oxford or  Cambridge?\" my mother asked me one day. These are.",
  "great and very famous places, and boys from good  public schools normally wanted to study at them.",
  "But I did not want to study more.  I chose to start work at a company.",
  "called Shell because I wanted to see the world. I travelled to many countries with Shell,.",
  "but that is a different story and a  different book. I may tell it one day."
