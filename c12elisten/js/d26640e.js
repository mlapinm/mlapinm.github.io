  "once upon a time in a prosperous town of a kingdom.",
  "there was a poor carpet weaver named jacques.",
  "he lived with his wife brielle in a small house.",
  "jacka was gifted with skillful and meticulous carpet weaving.",
  "so his handworks were so popular among the people there.",
  "the irony was he couldn't make any profit off of the carpets.",
  "so they still had to live in sheer poverty.",
  "although brielle seemed to be happy jacques always felt sorry.",
  "because he couldn't give her a better life.",
  "brielle what a loss for you because of being with a poor weaver like me.",
  "never say that having you by my side is enough for me honey.",
  "look your beautiful rugs will definitely cost much more than before.",
  "your hard work will definitely pay off and our life will be better soon.",
  "no that's never enough one day we will certainly become wealthy and prosperous.",
  "it's the only way for us to be happy.",
  "just like that the desire to become rich bore in jaka's mind all the time even when he slept.",
  "one day when he was busy weaving carpet.",
  "suddenly his loom was broken in half.",
  "this loom is too old it's high time i made a new secure one.",
  "so said so done xhaka came to the jungle with his axe to find a favorable tree.",
  "and then he finally found a large sturdy trunk.",
  "no better tree than this to make a loom.",
  "when jaco was just about to swing his axe to cut the tree down smoke rose.",
  "his axe flew out and he was tied up tightly to the pump.",
  "by what's going on is there anyone here help me.",
  "the smoke slowly dissipated and a jungle lord appeared in front of xhaka with anger.",
  "you insulin destroyer finally i caught you red-handed.",
  "who are you why are you binding me like this.",
  "i did nothing wrong please let me go.",
  "i am the lord of this jungle.",
  "i particularly detest loggers.",
  "what's wrong with my innocent subjects.",
  "why do you treat them partially like that.",
  "wait a second i'm xhaka a carpet weaver.",
  "this is the very first time i have come here.",
  "what the first time what on earth does a carpet weaver do in my jungle.",
  "i just wanted to find a good tree to make a new loom.",
  "because my old one was broken.",
  "i have no intention of destroying your jungle.",
  "please forgive me.",
  "well i'll spare your life this time.",
  "but you will not be allowed to come here to cut trees down again.",
  "if not just see what will happen to you.",
  "but without the new loom i couldn't weave carpets.",
  "my family thus would starve in poverty please help us.",
  "all right to help you i will give you three wishes.",
  "three wishes really.",
  "yes you can get whatever you want.",
  "come back home and discuss it with your wife carefully.",
  "then come here to tell me your wishes.",
  "thank you thank you so much.",
  "joyfully turned back.",
  "on the way he met a crafty friend named weston.",
  "despite also being poor he was so idle and lazy.",
  "hey xhaka what makes you so happy today.",
  "as happy as he was jacka honestly told weston all about his three wishes.",
  "really you did get three wishes from the jungle lord.",
  "yeah and i'm about to confer with my wife before making up my mind.",
  "weston immediately came up with an idea to take advantage of xhaka.",
  "that's really pointless in my point of view being a king is the best.",
  "me a king why not.",
  "you would be blessed with fortune without lifting a finger.",
  "it's so great isn't it.",
  "maybe you are right so i wish that i were a king.",
  "if it comes true don't forget to offer me a good position.",
  "being by your side i would certainly be your supportive mastermind.",
  "all right but i don't know anything about the government.",
  "what seat should i give you.",
  "a chancellor the one who always stands by the king's side.",
  "i will help you rule the kingdom.",
  "okay if i really were a king you'd be the chancellor weston.",
  "that's great jacka my good friend.",
  "right after that jaco went back to find the jungle lord.",
  "you come back much faster than i thought.",
  "what is your first wish.",
  "i want to be a king.",
  "what a king are you sure about it.",
  "if i become a king my wife and i would be wealthy and happy for my entire life.",
  "how could you think everything's so easy.",
  "how a poor carpet weaver could reign over the country.",
  "lord of the jungle all i need as a king is just to give orders.",
  "then my friend will help me rule the country.",
  "your friend it's all his idea right.",
  "i think you should stay away from that person as soon as possible.",
  "he is a cunning and self-interested person who can totally stab you in your back.",
  "no way weston is my good friend.",
  "all right as you wish.",
  "i hope that it will make you happy.",
  "then the forest god did a magic to fulfill jacques first wish.",
  "immediately he faded into the jungle.",
  "when xhaka opened his eyes he found himself a powerful king in a splendid palace.",
  "standing by his side was queen brielle.",
  "shaka what have happened to me and also you.",
  "we have become king and queen already.",
  "and his friend weston turned into a chancellor who was the head of all the officials in the court.",
  "living in the lap of luxury however jacques and briella felt so uncomfortable.",
  "always being scrutinized by everyone.",
  "they could no longer be free to do whatever they want as before.",
  "queen brielle secluded herself in the room all day.",
  "she felt as if she had been trapped in life.",
  "jacques could no longer weave carpets.",
  "instead he had to approve the reports and make decisions to govern the nation.",
  "despite being a king jacques had no idea about the imperial duty.",
  "more than that he didn't know the first thing to deal with crop failure which led to famine everywhere.",
  "jacques also couldn't quash the uprising who came to loot.",
  "eventually weston had the right to decide everything and become the most powerful person in the country.",
  "as a result the kingdom was in complete chaos.",
  "in every corner did people complain about such a puppet monarch.",
  "seeing that the time was right weston along with the army under his command organized a conspiracy to overthrow xhaka thus he would be a king.",
  "we'll take action tonight.",
  "when seeing my sign all of you will come in and capture that weak king xhaka alive.",
  "at that time i will become the new king.",
  "fortunately jacques heard all of this.",
  "being so scared he rushed to find brielle.",
  "the only one he could trust in the palace.",
  "brielle help me weston and the wicked out there are planning to stab me in the back.",
  "what should i do now.",
  "i knew it was a matter of time that this would happen.",
  "although you are king and we live in wealth we are still not happy like before.",
  "you're right i used to be so happy when i made a beautiful carpet.",
  "now i'm nothing different from a puppet.",
  "who does whatever weston and his people order.",
  "chaka we can be happy only when being ourselves.",
  "if only everything could go back like it used to be.",
  "back like before right i still have two more wishes left.",
  "let's go to find him now.",
  "when no one noticed xhaka and brielle rapidly escaped from the palace.",
  "they rushed to the jungle where the lord lived.",
  "fortunately he still recognized xhaka.",
  "what brings the king and queen here.",
  "have you had a good time.",
  "dear lord so stupid i was to believe that being a king will give us a happy life.",
  "however we just feel so suffocated.",
  "now i don't want to be a king anymore.",
  "being the true version of myself is the best.",
  "maybe you've learned the lesson.",
  "then what is your second wish.",
  "i want everything to be back like before.",
  "a magical light was flashed then the gorgeous costumes of jacques and brielle vanished.",
  "finding themselves be back in poverty.",
  "they happily gave each other a tight hug.",
  "and my last wish is a new good loom hence i could be a weaver as before.",
  "definitely your wish has come true.",
  "now you can come back home.",
  "jacques and brielle expressed their gratitude to the lord right before he disappeared.",
  "when they got home they saw a new beautiful loom on the table ever since.",
  "their life was finally back like the way it was before.",
  "every day they wholeheartedly weave carpets and enjoy their own life.",
  "not only they were blooming at their work.",
  "their family was happy as well.",
  "therefore they were soon better off and loved by other people.",
  "weston also turned back into a poor man.",
  "but he never accepted the truth.",
  "one day he pointed to three men on the street and shouted.",
  "those poor people come here and listen to my orders.",
  "he was hit so hard because of his bad manner.",
  "finally he had to left the kingdom forever.",
  "as you can see no need to have a lot of money.",
  "being ourselves is the true key for our happiness isn't  it."
