  "once upon a time the story began in a faraway land which was governed by a young lord named micah.",
  "he was a condescending lord who supposed everything he did is right.",
  "he had a beautiful younger sister named emma.",
  "in a time of darkness a huge famine hit everywhere of this land.",
  "food became precious and was a top concern in any area.",
  "many lords fought in bloody wars to take over the territory.",
  "many young men were embroiled in that unjust war and never turned back.",
  "people in micah's territory thus were gradually aged.",
  "they were weak and old men who needed help everywhere.",
  "those old people are a terrible burden in my kingdom.",
  "look they can't work at all but waste me a lot more food every day.",
  "younger's always had to devote their works for caring and helping them.",
  "how useless they are.",
  "gradually micah despised the old people so much.",
  "even though they had faithfully devoted all their life to serve him.",
  "old useless ones i don't need you anymore.",
  "i need strong young people who can work and fight.",
  "the precious food is for them not for the burdens like you all.",
  "from now on i will enact a new law called eliminating the elderly.",
  "all the over 60 year old people have to move to aldaria canyon to live on their own.",
  "anyone who tries to disassemble or disobey will be punished.",
  "yes just like that the stringent rule was carried out.",
  "then aldaria canyon was also known as the canyon for the old.",
  "when a person turned 60 they would be forced to move to the old canyon and be left there forever.",
  "anywhere people could see the separation and hear the bitter wailing or plaintiff cry.",
  "but they were worthless as it was the order of lord micah.",
  "brother everyone feels that law was too strict and so do i.",
  "don't be too wordy all my decisions are right.",
  "but the old didn't live their lives for chance.",
  "together they did make houses behind the canyon to live in.",
  "the strong people would cultivate food.",
  "and the weaker made delicate and skillful crafts.",
  "time went by the things kept going that way.",
  "one day a farmer turned over the age of 60.",
  "he had a kind and dutiful son named kevin.",
  "he was so weak that he was only able to do odds and ends.",
  "but his experience and wisdom were still there.",
  "so he often taught kevin many good lessons.",
  "kevin as your father is over 60 years old you must take him to old aria canyon tomorrow and leave him there.",
  "if you don't obey you know what will happen to you right.",
  "this is too unreasonable.",
  "well we have to accept the lord's command so as not to be punished.",
  "don't worry there are many old people there and everything is going to be fine.",
  "tomorrow you should drive me to the canyon by horse cart and go back home early son.",
  "father i haven't done anything for you yet.",
  "please let me carry you there.",
  "the next day kevin carried his father on his shoulder and found out the way to aldaria canyon.",
  "along the way the father reached out to break small branches.",
  "then he scattered them on the ground.",
  "father what are you doing.",
  "i mark the way so that you can return without getting lost.",
  "no i can't callously leave him like that.",
  "i will definitely oppose such that a reasonable law at all costs.",
  "no you can't do it son don't try to violate the law.",
  "take me back to that canyon right now.",
  "no i can't please let me take you back home.",
  "kevin took his father home and hid him in the cellar.",
  "every day he brought food and water and talked to bring him relief.",
  "the guards came to inspect the house but they found the father nowhere.",
  "therefore they thought that kevin had left his father in the canyon.",
  "the next day a messenger from the neighboring lord came to visit micah's castle.",
  "as he came from a more powerful territory he seemed to be very arrogant.",
  "my lord has sent you two questions.",
  "if you can solve them then we will establish a good relationship between the two territories.",
  "if not the beautiful emma will go with us to marry our lord.",
  "brother i don't want to marry the lord of the neighboring country.",
  "but they'll attack us immediately if we refuse their condition.",
  "how can we fight against them with our current strength.",
  "okay so you say what are the two questions.",
  "the first question is to find out a way to thread through this snail shell.",
  "the next one we brought a herd of small cows and a herd of mother cows the two groups are completely separated.",
  "how to pair up the calves with their mothers.",
  "how can we thread through such a small snail shell.",
  "the second sentence is even more difficult.",
  "how do you know each pair while they are totally the same.",
  "how's it going sir interesting right.",
  "you'll have three days to give me the answer.",
  "after three days we will turn back to my land.",
  "if you can't answer correctly then.",
  "micah anxiously asked this question to the ministers.",
  "but no one could come up with anything.",
  "people were quickly commanded to help the lord answer the question.",
  "however his territory was only full of young people who had only a little experiences.",
  "so no one knew the correct answer.",
  "news soon reached the ears of kevin.",
  "he also didn't know the answer but suddenly he thought of his father.",
  "my father is really wise maybe he can make it clear.",
  "hmm nothing is difficult tell the lord that all he needs is like this.",
  "he can definitely do it.",
  "he went to the castle and asked to see micah.",
  "the lord hastily told kevin to come in.",
  "emma had complete faith in him while the messenger gave a farmer like him a contemptuous look.",
  "you are kevin who has the answers for the messenger's questions right tell me now.",
  "hope that his answers will be correct.",
  "even the ministers had no idea about them.",
  "does such a farmer really want to be something.",
  "firstly thread through this snail shell.",
  "lord please catch an ant and tie a thread around it.",
  "then drop it on one side of the shell.",
  "after that drip a drop of delicious honey on the end of the shell.",
  "the ant will help us carry the thread through the shell quickly as what kevin had said the ant really carried the thread through the shell at mica surprise and delight.",
  "great good job how smart he is.",
  "even the great ministers can't solve this riddle.",
  "how could a young man.",
  "well even though you solved the first question the next one is on another level.",
  "please distinguish each pair of cows for me.",
  "why do i have to distinguish when they can actually recognize each other.",
  "but how what lord just wait for the cows to be really hungry then release them.",
  "they will find themselves back to their mothers without lifting a finger.",
  "okay do exactly what he has said.",
  "as kevin said when the hungry cows had just been released they ran right towards their mothers.",
  "then the messenger had no choice but to leave.",
  "the two territories agree to build a strong relationship.",
  "thank you kevin do you know that you've saved me your intelligence is admirable.",
  "how can you figure them out.",
  "i promise to reward you generously and agree with whatever you want.",
  "actually my father who was supposed to have been left in the canyon because of your law came up with the two answers.",
  "but how can i leave him like that.",
  "so i hid him in the cellar of my house.",
  "what those amazing ideas were drawn by an old person unbelievable.",
  "all of us have to get old one day but their life experience and wisdom are exactly what we need to learn.",
  "please repeal that unreasonable law.",
  "i agree that your father is indeed a learned and experienced man.",
  "but that doesn't mean the same old are wise and useful too.",
  "lord so can you please go with me to visit the canyon of the old.",
  "perhaps they will make you think again reaching the valley behind the canyon.",
  "micah was amazed to see many beautiful houses and desirable fields.",
  "the lord really admired the exquisite crafts made by the old people together they still lived a good life even though no one was young there anymore.",
  "unbelievable i thought that they were all useless and then abandoned them.",
  "i really made a terrible mistake.",
  "they have much life experience that is precious to our life.",
  "the old are always helpful.",
  "i really hope that you will repeal that law.",
  "in the end micah admitted his mistake and sincerely apologized to all people in his territory.",
  "the lord has dismissed his unreasonable law.",
  "so all the elderly could happily reunite with their families.",
  "since then the canyon of the old disappeared forever.",
  "no longer despised the old micah turned to be much more modest than ever.",
  "kevin and emma had a wonderful feeling for each other.",
  "they became more and more intimate.",
  "not long after the lord held the biggest marriage ever for both of them.",
  "undoubtedly they would live in the love of other people.",
  "and had a happy life now and evermore."
