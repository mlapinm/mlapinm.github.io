  "children this is hope she's joining your class.",
  "in the middle of the Year.",
  "yes now please move a bit so she may sit in the empty place next to you.",
  "Tia a new girl joined a class today.",
  "oh in the middle of the Year.",
  "yes and can you believe it.",
  "the teacher made her sit next to me.",
  "well that's good she'll need friends in a new school.",
  "you can be that friend.",
  "and make sure she doesn't feel lonely or scared.",
  "also this will give you a chance to make a new friend.",
  "yes maybe I could.",
  "but I don't have the time right now.",
  "maybe after few days.",
  "okay just remember tofu.",
  "what you do today will affect your tomorrow.",
  "what do you mean.",
  "the trees and the ACT.",
  "once upon a time a Woodcutter reached the forest.",
  "but noticed that his axes handle had broken.",
  "oh no I will not be able to do any work today.",
  "my access handle has broken.",
  "I will have to go back home.",
  "don't worry if you really need help.",
  "then you can take one of my branches.",
  "and make a handle for your axe with it.",
  "that's a very good idea.",
  "really you would let me do that.",
  "of course why not.",
  "thank you.",
  "thankful for the help that he had been offered.",
  "The Woodcutter gently cut off a part of the tree's branch.",
  "with care and skilled craftsmanship.",
  "he made a beautiful handle for it.",
  "once his axe was ready.",
  "he started chopping larger portions of the trees.",
  "one by one he chopped off most of the trees.",
  "I cannot believe what he has done.",
  "yes one by one he has cut down all our friends.",
  "what fools we have been handing over a weapon of our destruction to our enemy.",
  "yes true we should have thought all those days ago before helping him fix his axe.",
  "yes our actions on that day are the reason why we have the situation today.",
  "that's a good story Tia.",
  "and it helps me thinking if I wait before becoming friends with hope.",
  "I may not be of any help to her.",
  "or I might miss the chance of being friends with hope completely.",
  "yes that's right tofu.",
  "well tomorrow.",
  "when we come back to school.",
  "I will make sure that.",
  "that does not happen that's good."
