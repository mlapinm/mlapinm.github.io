  "Tia, Today I am very happy.",
  "I met one of my friends who was acting all greedy and selfish in class.",
  "So I told him the story.",
  "of \"THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN\".",
  "and he soon understood the lesson.",
  "Really Tofu?.",
  "I haven't heard this one.",
  "I would love to hear it from you.",
  "Once upon a time, there was a town named Hamelin.",
  "The town was beautiful.",
  "bustling with energy and wealth.",
  "But no sooner.",
  "the happiness of the town was ruined by a plague.",
  "Plague of rats.",
  "There were rats everywhere.",
  "so much so that the people of the town.",
  "didn't even have a place to keep a step without tripping over the rats.",
  "There were rats of every size, shape.",
  "every age and color.",
  "Nothing worked as a remedy.",
  "Not even the cats were able to control the plague of rats.",
  "Giving up, the authorities decided to announce a reward of 10 bags of gold.",
  "to anyone who could help to get rid of the rats.",
  "One day, a strange looking man came to the town.",
  "He was dressed in their traditional dress but all red in color.",
  "With a long peculiar nose and big wide eyes.",
  "he adorned his head with a feather in his hat.",
  "He went to the authorities and said.",
  "I have a solution for your problem.",
  "I assure you, that not a single rat would live in this beautiful town.",
  "but i want the 10 gold bags that you have promised as prize.",
  "The authorities were not very sure of his commitment.",
  "but still allowed him to give it a try as they had no other option.",
  "Soon the strange looking man took out a Pied Piper.",
  "from his pocket and started playing a very strange tune.",
  "with in no time, all the rats started coming out and following him.",
  "From every nook and corner of the town, so many rats came out.",
  "that the whole street was filled with them.",
  "Very strangely the rats started following the pied piper.",
  "who was playing the strangest tune ever heard.",
  "The Pied piper took them to the town's river and entered into it.",
  "In no time all the rats mesmerized by his tune.",
  "fell into the river and drowned.",
  "There were rejoices in the town.",
  "Celebrations all over.",
  "Soon the Pied Piper went to the authorities, to claim his prize money.",
  "But since their work was done.",
  "and they thought that this plague would never return.",
  "they shun him off and asked him to leave.",
  "without giving him a single penny.",
  "What selfish people are these?.",
  "I did them a favor freed them from such a bad epidemic.",
  "and all that they could care was to be greedy and ungrateful?.",
  "Now look how i will teach these selfish people a lesson.",
  "The pied piper took out his pipe once again.",
  "and started playing another strange tune.",
  "A tune that no one has ever heard before.",
  "In no time all the children of the town mesmerized by the music.",
  "started following the Pied Piper.",
  "The children were so lost in his tune.",
  "that they didnâ€™t realise that they have come out.",
  "to the outskirts of the town.",
  "The pied piper took them to a cave.",
  "and led them in.",
  "He kept playing the tune till all the children were inside the cave.",
  "He then closed the cave with a huge stone.",
  "Only two kids were left in the entire town.",
  "A boy who was hard of hearing and a girl who had hurt her leg so badly.",
  "that she couldn't keep up the pace with the rest of the kids.",
  "These two kids went back.",
  "and told their parents about the Pied Piper.",
  "and how he lured all the children into the cave.",
  "Soon the authorities went begging to the pied piper.",
  "and requested him to let their children out.",
  "This time they promised to reward him with 20 gold bags.",
  "I don't trust you any longer. I want my prize money before hand.",
  "Soon he was handed over his prize money.",
  "and he left never to be seen again.",
  "The children were freed from the cave.",
  "and the parents hugged them and cried.",
  "Watching this the authorities said.",
  "We surely have learnt a lesson.",
  "This man came out of no where and saved us from an epidemic.",
  "All that we did in return was to be selfish and ungrateful.",
  "He surely taught us a lesson of not to be greedy and selfish.",
  "That night the town rejoiced and celebrated like a festival.",
  "It's still said that in the town of Hamelin if you ever go, and listen carefully.",
  "you might hear the beautiful sound of the Pied Piper.",
  "Tofu! I am so proud of you.",
  "You must be a little naughty but you surely are a good boy!.",
  "Hahahahaha!."
