  "once upon a time in a kingdom there was a prince named william.",
  "because.",
  "the prince did not agree to marry the witch's niece.",
  "the witch used magic to lock him in an iron box.",
  "after casting a curse on william to make him forget who would rescue him the witch left.",
  "many years passed and still there was no one to free him.",
  "one day a princess named carol from a different kingdom went to a walk in the forest.",
  "but she got lost because she was too attracted to the beautiful scenery in the forest.",
  "carol had been wandering in the forest for 9 days without knowing the way out.",
  "she did not know that she was approaching an iron box.",
  "in the confusion she suddenly heard a voice.",
  "where are you from and where do you want to go next.",
  "carol was turtle then looking around she saw an iron box.",
  "i got lost in the forest and now i don't know the way home.",
  "i will show you the way back home.",
  "but you must promise to do everything i say.",
  "i am the prince of a big kingdom.",
  "i want to marry you and live with you forever.",
  "i don't know how to live with a box.",
  "however she really wanted to return home.",
  "so she accepted to do everything the iron box requested.",
  "follow this butterfly it will lead you home.",
  "then from inside of the box i flew a butterfly.",
  "carol followed the butterfly and it led her out of the forest.",
  "right to the front of her father's palace.",
  "yay i'm harmed now.",
  "after that the butterfly flew high and went back to the forest.",
  "the king was deeply moved when carol returned to the palace.",
  "dear father i got lost in the forest.",
  "fortunately i met an iron box.",
  "it was the one to lead me home.",
  "i also promised to go back there to free the iron box and marry it.",
  "hearing that the king was very shocked because carol was his only child.",
  "the princess was also very sad about her fate.",
  "the king immediately discussed this and sought out someone to replace the princess.",
  "the miller's daughter was the chosen one.",
  "the next morning she went to the iron box with a knife to replace the princess.",
  "even though she had been stabbing the iron box for 24 hours.",
  "the box still remained the same unbroken.",
  "when the sun just dawned there was a voice from the inside of the iron box.",
  "i think the sky is turning bright again.",
  "maybe i just heard the sound of the running windmill.",
  "oh so you're the miller's daughter.",
  "you can go right now and ask the princess to come here.",
  "the miller's daughter went back and told the king that the ironbox didn't like her and just wanted the princess.",
  "hearing that the king became scared.",
  "and the princess could just complain about her fate.",
  "in the palace there was another pretty girl.",
  "who was even more beautiful than the girl in the milling family.",
  "it was the daughter of the family who raises pigs.",
  "the king next told her to replace the princess.",
  "come on call the girl the pig raising family here.",
  "the next day the girl in the pig raising family came to the iron box's place.",
  "she stabbed her knife into the iron box for 24 hours.",
  "and the box still remained unchanged without any damage.",
  "in the early morning a voice came from the iron box.",
  "i think the sky is turning bright again.",
  "um maybe i just heard the sound of my father's horn.",
  "ah you are the girl who races pigs.",
  "you can go away and ask the princess to come here.",
  "and tell the princess that if she does not keep her promise.",
  "her palace will collapse and everything will be broken.",
  "the girl who raised pigs immediately went back and reported to the king and the princess what the ironbox had said.",
  "hearing that the princess was really depressed.",
  "but since there were no other choice the princess had to bring a chisel to go to the forest.",
  "when she arrived the princess started chiseling and after two hours the princess wore a small hole looking into that hole.",
  "under the sparking light of gold and diamonds.",
  "the princess saw a tiny person.",
  "her heart suddenly fluttered.",
  "she continued chiseling non-stop until the hole became bigger.",
  "a man walked outside it was prince william he was locked in the iron box by the witch.",
  "you were the one to rescue me you are my fiance.",
  "come back with me to the castle.",
  "but i want to go back to say goodbye to my father first.",
  "he must be looking forward to seeing me back.",
  "okay go back and say goodbye to your father.",
  "but only say three sentences and come back right away.",
  "thanks darling however when she got home.",
  "because she was too involved in the conversation with her father.",
  "she forgot what william had said.",
  "waiting for a time for her to return.",
  "prince william was slowly possessed by the witch's curse.",
  "prince william forgot the princess and he tried to find his way home.",
  "soon he went through the glass mountains the waving river.",
  "and finally arrived at his magnificent castle.",
  "it was not until midnight that the princess remembered william's words.",
  "carol hurriedly said goodbye to her father and returned to the forest.",
  "but when she arrived the ironbox as well as the prince were not there anymore.",
  "she kept walking for nine days with a hungry stomach.",
  "and decided to climb up a tree and sit there.",
  "the sky was really dark and she was sitting there with the fear of being eaten by wild beasts.",
  "she could only sit and pray for the morning to come as soon as possible.",
  "suddenly she saw a little bright light from a distance so far.",
  "hopefully i can escape she climbed down the tree and followed the direction of the fire.",
  "and then she saw a tiny house.",
  "how can i get inside the house.",
  "she moved closer to the window and looked inside.",
  "there was a table full of special food and a little fairy was cooking.",
  "it was the fairy sophia she held her breath.",
  "and knocked on the door.",
  "when's the plum girl please hurry up come to the door see who that is.",
  "a fairy with a plump body shape ran out to open the door.",
  "it was the fairy aurora.",
  "fairy aurora smiled and looked at the princess.",
  "then used her wand to make the princess a tiny girl.",
  "princess carol sat on the table with the two fairies.",
  "fairy sophia asked the princess.",
  "where are you from girl and where are you going.",
  "the princess told them the whole story.",
  "and how she broke the promise with william.",
  "she said she would search everywhere until she could see him again.",
  "aurora please go to the room and bring the box out here.",
  "fairy aurora ran into the room to get the box.",
  "miss sophia took two plowshares one chopsticks and three chestnuts out from the box.",
  "princess please remember to bring these two plushies and chopsticks.",
  "when you go to the glass mountain and a river use those things as your friend.",

  "early the next morning princess carol said goodbye to the two little fairies.",
  "and set out thanks to the kids from the fairies.",
  "carol could pass the glass mountains and river easily.",
  "right on the riverbank stood a big palace.",
  "she asked for a job as a mate there.",
  "because she knew that her lover was the prince of this castle.",
  "however the prince was cursed to forget his lover.",
  "so after he returned to the palace he was always sad.",
  "and could not be happy.",
  "he told people to spread a message throughout the whole kingdom to say that he would marry the girl.",
  "who rescued him from the witch's iron box.",
  "there was a girl who came and claimed that she was the one who rescued him.",
  "and she could explain everything that had happened.",
