  "The Pebble Shooter.",
  "Once Upon a Time in the Glorious land of Laos the land of a million elephants.",
  "there lived a little boy by the name of Mance.",
  "he had no parents and was lame in one leg.",
  "but mansei was a very happy child.",
  "who was well looked after by the villagers.",
  "I brought you fresh vegetables from my garden.",
  "oh Leia.",
  "vegetables.",
  "I've brought him something better.",
  "a sugary sweet pie.",
  "that'll rot all his teeth.",
  "The Village children would always play with him.",
  "but in one particular game he was the best.",
  "wow how'd you hit that tree.",
  "that's Mandy for you.",
  "he can aim at anything no matter how far it is.",
  "well.",
  "the truth was Mance would spend a lot of time practicing flicking pebbles at far away objects.",
  "he could even hit at leaves in the top most parts of tall trees.",
  "one day as he was sitting alone under a large bunion tree.",
  "he started flicking pebbles at the leaves.",
  "oh wow the sunlight that came through the leaf made an image on the ground.",
  "looks like a boy dancing.",
  "and so it did when the leaves fluttered.",
  "and the sun rays moved with them.",
  "the image on the ground would move beautifully.",
  "as his friends came to find him.",
  "they were delighted with the show.",
  "oh what is this.",
  "it's beautiful.",
  "let's make something else eh.",
  "soon he had created an elephant on one leaf.",
  "and then a baby elephant like a baby elephant.",
  "but the children were enjoying the show.",
  "and almost didn't see the king and his soldiers approaching that way.",
  "but they turned as they heard the sounds.",
  "oh no the king quick let's hide.",
  "come on man say.",
  "the kids hid behind the bushes.",
  "and the King and his troops soon came over to rest.",
  "but as soon as the wind blew and moved the leaves around.",
  "the elephants showed up near the king and surprised him.",
  "what's this.",
  "it it looks like magic.",
  "it's beautiful.",
  "guards find the person.",
  "who has created this art.",
  "oh no they'll come to find us.",
  "run run.",
  "wait wait for me.",
  "but the children ran away leaving Mance behind.",
  "even though the King was a good man to Little Children.",
  "he was still someone great and fearsome.",
  "I found a boy here.",
  "let's bring him to the king.",
  "and so poor scared Mance was brought before the king trembling.",
  "is it you who made these images.",
  "yes your highness.",
  "prove it make another one for us.",
  "man say picked a pebble.",
  "but just then a songbird perched itself on a branch.",
  "seeing it manse had an idea.",
  "he flicked the pebbles at one broken leaf.",
  "and formed the image of the bird's body on another Leaf.",
  "he created the bird's head.",
  "and when the leaves moved everyone watched in amazement.",
  "amazing it looks like the bird is singing the song.",
  "The King and his men enjoyed and clapped to the song of the sunlit bird.",
  "my boy you have a remarkable talent.",
  "I would like to bring you back to my castle.",
  "you would be able to help me a great deal.",
  "and so mansei sat in the very Carriage as the king.",
  "and rode all the way to the Royal Palace.",
  "there manse was impressed at being inside.",
  "now listen carefully to what I have to say.",
  "I will soon be holding a meeting with my ministers.",
  "one of which doesn't stop talking.",
  "oh I mean the man just keeps on with the blah blah blah.",
  "I want to teach him how to listen to others too.",
  "so how can I help.",
  "you must hide between the curtains.",
  "and shoot bitter orange peels into his mouth.",
  "Mansay was very amused and agreed to the king's plan.",
  "he stepped behind a curtain opposite to the minister Eric's side.",
  "soon the meeting started.",
  "oh no I didn't ask the King which minister.",
  "now then.",
  "I've called you all to discuss the thefts in the Kingdom.",
  "does anyone have anything to say about it.",
  "where's Sia I was wondering.",
  "I was thinking maybe we should just ask the victims.",
  "I do know that some of them saw the thief at some points.",
  "it's amazing.",
  "then we can.",
  "but I do feel.",
  "it will take some time to find the man.",
  "after all it is a huge Kingdom.",
  "and we do have such nice people.",
  "Eric I think he wants to say Sam.",
  "but we do have many soldiers in the kingdom.",
  "it may not take as much time as I fear.",
  "so that's the man.",
  "well time to take a break Mr talkative.",
  "he shot the peel straight into Eric's mouth.",
  "who is very surprised.",
  "but soon turned pale.",
  "what's wrong Eric is everything fine.",
  "in my mouth.",
  "Eric you're in front of the king.",
  "it's all right.",
  "well what were you going to say.",
  "who will your highness.",
  "uh I was saying.",
  "that the people of this there may be a thief in the midst of our people I mean.",
  "we can never be too sure.",
  "oh dear I guess Eric's a little tongue-tied at this time.",
  "we're at your highness.",
  "if you'll hear me out.",
  "I'm sorry for that but I only wanted to say that.",
  "why is this happening.",
  "every time I open my mouth something horrible drops in.",
  "and so this time he swallowed the peel.",
  "and decided to stay quiet for fear of something else being shot into his mouth.",
  "well should I speak now.",
  "finally your majesty.",
  "what I wanted to say.",
  "was that there's a traveling circus Caravan in our kingdom.",
  "and at every stop it makes a nearby house is always robbed.",
  "that is rather interesting.",
  "so do you want to visit the next place it stops at.",
  "exactly your majesty.",
  "that is a very good idea.",
  "what do you think Eric.",
  "Eric was quite impressed at the idea.",
  "yes go on.",
  "will I quite agree with what he said.",
  "excellent it really is nice to hear many different opinions isn't it.",
  "oh uh yes it is.",
  "in this way whenever Eric spoke too much.",
  "men say would shoot appeal into his mouth.",
  "so Eric remained quiet for the whole time.",
  "and had no other choice but to listen to the others.",
  "I can't remember ever having heard their opinions before.",
  "do I really talk that much.",
  "after the meeting was over the king came up to Eric.",
  "well now do you realize that giving others a chance to speak.",
  "and voice their opinions is an important thing.",
  "yes I'm sorry for the way I've behaved.",
  "I'll try hard to change from now on.",
  "ah mission accomplished.",
  "the King was.",
  "very pleased with men say.",
  "and allowed him to stay in the palace.",
  "he was well fed and looked after.",
  "and lived a very happy life.",
  "displaying his talent to others.",
  "and as for Eric well.",
  "he was true to his word.",
  "and tried hard to allow others the chance to speak.",
  "because listening to others opinions is a very important thing.",
  "we must always care and value other people's thoughts too.",
