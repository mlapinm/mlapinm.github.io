  "once upon a time in a peaceful village of a prosperous kingdom.",
  "there lived two best friends named kevin and stefan.",
  "they had been together since they were children.",
  "kevin was a hard-working and gentle man.",
  "he went to the jungle every day to cut woods and hunt animals.",
  "on contrary stefan was a greedy and lazy man.",
  "however his family was so wealthy that he could be the owner of a tavern in town.",
  "at that time there was a fire dragon who lived in the high mountain of this kingdom.",
  "he would destroy the whole kingdom if they didn't give him one person as a tribute for each month.",
  "tomorrow is the tribute day of that lame kingdom.",
  "it will be a delicious meal for me.",
  "kevin usually went to the jungle from early in the morning to late at night.",
  "so he never cared about the information of this dragon.",
  "that night it was stefan's turn to be the tribute for the dragon.",
  "then he sat there thought about a way to trick kevin to redeem him.",
  "that afternoon when stefan was informed.",
  "that he would be the one who had to be the tribute for the dragon he was really shocked.",
  "that's right i have to trick kevin.",
  "he's so foolish so he'll come and see the dragon and redeem me that's a perfect plan.",
  "at that very moment kevin stepped inside the tavern.",
  "then they joyfully talked to each other.",
  "kevin started his coming plan.",
  "kevin my friend today is my turn to watch out the treasure of the king in.",
  "that high mountain.",
  "but i'm too busy with the tavern could you please help me do that.",
  "it's okay my friend anyway i cannot go to the jungle at night.",
  "i can help you.",
  "that night kevin went to the cave to protect the imaginative treasure that stefan made out.",
  "however he could only see a giant dragon in the middle of the cave.",
  "he was waiting for kevin.",
  "haha poor human it's your turn to give me your life.",
  "that will be your last honor.",
  "what do you want why are you here don't threaten me i'm not scared of you.",
  "the dragon breathed fire to destroy kevin.",
  "but with the response and the experience of a hunter kevin fought back.",
  "and defeated the dragon by his axe.",
  "and stefan stood in front of his tavern.",
  "he was really joyful after tricking his friend to redeem himself.",
  "the foolish kevin should have died now.",
  "just blame yourself for being too trusting.",
  "after defeating the dragon kevin quickly came back to inform stefan.",
  "but he started to doubt stefan.",
  "stefan why did you tell me that i will be the one who will protect the treasure of the king.",
  "but there was only a fierce dragon inside that cave.",
  "he even tried to kill me.",
  "what why on earth could have a dragon there.",
  "it's the place for the king to hide his treasure.",
  "i don't know i just went inside the cave and there was a dragon standing there.",
  "he tried to kill me but with my skills i defeated him.",
  "it's not good kevin i've remembered it's the dragon that the king raised.",
  "he had the responsibility to watch that mountain.",
  "you will be executed if the king knows that you killed him.",
  "i'll take care of everything here please go somewhere to hide.",
  "really so unlucky i'll have to go to the jungle to hide.",
  "please take care of everything for me.",
  "kevin quickly said goodbye to his friend.",
  "and went to the jungle to avoid the punishment of the king.",
  "stefan immediately took the chance.",
  "he went to the palace to inform the king.",
  "that he had defeated the fire dragon and brought peace to the kingdom.",
  "that's great you have saved our kingdom.",
  "i will ordain you unto the general position.",
  "you will command the army of our kingdom.",
  "thank you your majesty.",
  "one day when the princess was walking around in the garden an eagle suddenly swooped down and grabbed her.",
  "talking about kevin after defeating the fire dragon.",
  "he had to hide in a cave deep inside the jungle.",
  "that was a beautiful morning when he was standing in front of the cave.",
  "kevin heard a strange voice from above.",
  "help me help me please.",
  "seeing that a girl was being grabbed by an eagle.",
  "kevin immediately used his bow to shot.",
  "getting wounded in his left wings the eagle gnawed the arrow to take it out.",
  "and continue to fly back to his hideaway.",
  "kevin followed the blood traces and found a cave.",
  "however the cave was so deep that he would not be able to climb up after entering.",
  "this cave is too deep.",
  "even when i can save the girl i will never be able to climb up.",
  "what should i do now.",
  "that's right stefan.",
  "i have to come back and ask for his help.",
  "after the princess was kidnapped the king was very angry.",
  "he ordered stefan to come and meet him.",
  "stefan the princess has been kidnapped by an eagle.",
  "you have to bring her back by all means if not you will have to resign.",
  "stefan was really worried.",
  "he didn't know how to bring the princess back.",

  "kevin why are you here the king is looking for you why don't you hide.",
  "stefan go to the jungle with me.",
  "i found the hideaway of an eagle and kidnapped a girl.",
  "go with me i need your help.",
  "if there is any problem call someone to help.",
  "if i can save the girl you just need to throw the rope down and pull me and the girl up.",
  "an eagle a girl is that.",
  "when i didn't know what to do then the foolish kevin came here and helped me.",
  "god is helping me.",

  "when they reached the entrance of the cave kevin climbed down to fight against the eagle.",
  "and stefan stood there and watched.",
  "stefan you will stay here and pay attention throw the rope down when i call.",
  "if there's nothing happening until the evening you will have to call the others to come here and support us.",
  "kevin don't worry i will always be here to watch.",
  "after climbing down kevin saw that the princess was trapped in an iron cage.",
  "and the eagle was standing there to watch her.",
  "kevin immediately went there to fight against the eagle.",
  "after a while the eagle was finally defeated.",
  "after that kevin quickly used his axe to break the lock and freed the princess.",
  "hello how are you don't be scared i'm here to rescue you.",
  "but it seemed like after being caught by the eagle the princess was too shocked.",
  "she couldn't say anything but she looked appreciatively at kevin.",
  "stefan i have saved the girl just pull her up first.",
  "stefan heard that then he threw the rope down.",
  "kevin tied the rope around her waist.",
  "then told stefan to pull her up.",
  "stefan everything is all right now pull her up then throw the rope down here and pull me up.",

  "really thank you so much.",
  "i don't know what to do without your help.",
  "although the princess was rescued.",
  "but she was sad all the time.",
  "she didn't even say anything making the king so worried.",
  "stefan had to go everywhere to find a doctor which was able to cure her.",
  "but it was useless.",
  "no one could cure her.",
  "the king then informed the whole kingdom that if anyone could cure the princess would be able to get great reward.",
  "after escaping the cave kevin came back to the kingdom.",
  "and he could read the notice of the king.",
  "then he finally understood everything.",
  "it turns out that stefan is a traitor.",
  "he wanted to lock me in the cave and take credit for my work.",
  "to get away of stefan spies kevin disguised himself into a poor old man asking for permission to enter the palace to cure the princess.",

  "stephen you insolent how dare you fooled me servant bring him out to execute.",
  "please spare me my life your majesty my greed blinded me.",
  "with the kind heart kevin could never stand there and send his friend to death.",
  "so he asked the king to spare stefan's life.",
  "your majesty even stefan made a big mistake.",
  "but please give him a chance.",
  "i believe that he will change.",
  "no matter what happened kevin and stefan had been best friends since they were kids.",
  "and they also had a wonderful time together.",
