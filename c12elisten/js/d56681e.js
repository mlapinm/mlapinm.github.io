  "Merlin was right.",
  "The Sword and the stone had revealed that Tim indeed was Arthur Pendragon.",
  "but it was now up to him to live his Destiny of the one true king.",
  "Arthur lived his years being the one true king.",
  "for The Sword in the Stone was only the first legendary story on his realm.",
  "soon he was going to have his Knights of the Round Table.",

  "your highness.",
  "the neighboring Kingdom has offered a truce.",
  "this will bring peace to both the kingdoms.",
  "of course they offer the truce.",
  "they must have gotten scared of my never-ending success.",
  "I have built this all by myself.",
  "of course mother you have single-handedly won so many battles.",
  "yes my dear Audrey.",
  "General tell them we will decide a place and time for the truce.",
  "and they will have to be there if they want it.",
  "mother you have been brave and defied all.",
  "and there is no doubt about that.",
  "but to believe that you have single-handedly won the battles is wrong.",
  "you have a massive Army at your disposal.",
  "you are destined to be a great leader and you are.",
  "but it is fate that guides us all.",
  "not our bravery alone.",
  "princess Samantha was the younger princess of the kingdom and unlike the Elder.",
  "princess Audrey she always spoke her mind and sought to have humility in her mother.",
  "only weaklings believe in fate.",

  "he is cast.",
  "ah oh my you're without a doubt the most.",
  "oh oh horrible.",
  "I am.",

  "your highness the strange man seems to be cursed by the Warlock.",
  "he can neither sleep nor eat.",
  "that notorious warlock has troubled many kingdoms.",
  "but mother what are the mountains of eclectus.",
  "a Cletus is home to many magical beings.",
  "and like the Warlock not all of them are friendly.",
  "over the years many good soldiers have lost themselves in pursuit of this Warlock.",
  "I'm afraid we cannot help the strange man.",
  "he may be cursed.",
  "but at least he is breathing.",
  "the mountains of eclectus is not a place he should be.",
  "your highness the mountains respect a complete soul in the olden times it was said that when two people are in unison.",
  "the two Souls become one whole.",
  "one way for two people to be in unison is marriage.",
  "if that strange man is married to somebody.",
  "then he and his partner can enter the mountains.",
  "and reach the Warlock without being lost.",
  "that's a silly suggestion.",
  "I cannot expect anybody from my kingdom.",
  "to marry the strange man and enter the forest.",
  "it's dangerous.",
  "I will marry him.",
  "mother I am the princess of this Kingdom.",
  "this warlock must be defeated.",
  "and it is only right for me to step up.",
  "I am trained for battle.",
  "I can protect the man.",
  "and defeat the Warlock.",
  "this is my fate.",
  "oh you and your fate Samantha.",
  "Queen Trinity and Princess Audrey tried everything they could to convince her.",
  "but the younger princess had made up her mind.",
  "the ceremony was short and simple.",
  "the marriage forged a union of Samantha and Sullivan.",
  "to the Queen's dismay.",
  "the younger princess immediately left for the mountains of eclectus.",
  "with her newly wedded husband.",
  "yes yes we are in the forest.",
  "tell me my princess how is it that you don't need a torch.",
  "you don't stop biting me.",
  "I will sneeze so hard enough to throw you to the other.",
  "end of the forest.",
  "so where were we.",
  "yes how don't you need a torch.",
  "um because you're glowing enough.",
  "of course you are a princess and quite intelligent.",
  "thanks.",
  "no I didn't mean it that way.",
  "stop biting.",
  "one night when the princess returned from a nearby pond with water.",
  "she was astonished to see that Sullivan was in a deep sleep.",
  "and strange yet.",
  "she saw that the light of her husband was leaving through the palm of his hands.",
  "oh my his nose is not a great place to stay.",
  "I was sure he was going to sneeze.",
  "get away from my husband.",
  "princess please.",
  "we are not going to hurt King Sullivan.",
  "King Sullivan.",
  "yes princess.",
  "he is the king of the new lands.",
  "the kingdom of Newlands is far away Beyond The Valleys.",
  "it is near our home that Lake of the Pixies.",
  "we were being troubled by a warlock.",
  "who lives in these fairy mountains.",
  "we get our energy from our queen.",
  "as she gets it from the Wonderstone.",
  "it has immense power.",
  "but the Warlock stole it from our very home.",
  "and since then the queen has been sick.",
  "we went to King Sullivan for help.",
  "and as kind as he is he readily agreed.",
  "the Wonderstone is passed by our ancestors.",
  "and only we can get it back.",
  "so we had to travel with the King.",
  "our energy is reducing and we need a source to survive.",
  "the king offered us to stay on him.",
  "once we reached the warlock's Cave.",
  "the king will fight the Warlock.",
  "and we will retrieve the Wonderstone.",
  "and how will he fight the Warlock.",
  "if he isn't sleeping or eating.",
  "the Pixies had no answer.",
  "I am proud of him.",
  "everybody kept thinking that he is madman Sullivan.",
  "and he didn't care for any of that.",
  "he indeed is a strong and brave King.",
  "he will defeat the Warlock but he cannot survive like this.",
  "wait I can help.",
  "Samantha had a secret friend of her own.",
  "the Fairy of the ponds.",
  "she called for the fairy and asked for her help in this odd situation.",
  "the fairy thought for a while.",
  "went back in the water and came back with some magical mud.",
  "Samantha made a pot out of the mud.",
  "and asked all the Pixies to sit inside.",
  "the magic of the pot gave strength to the Pixies.",
  "and they didn't have to sit on the king anymore.",
  "remember my dear princess.",
  "the one way to defeat the Warlock is to expose him to Pure light.",
  "it was almost afternoon the next day when Sullivan woke up.",
  "oh wow it feels like the sleep of Ages.",
  "wait I can blink.",
  "did I defeat the Warlock in sleep.",
  "the Pixies got their Stone.",
  "just what I thought my husband is an intelligent and wise man.",
  "you had to say something like that.",
  "we are yet to reach the cave King.",
  "The Pixies got tired of your sneezing threats.",
  "and found themselves another home.",
  "I know all about the Pixies and how you offered to help.",
  "I'm proud of you.",
  "I knew I married the white woman.",
  "in a short while they reached the Cape of the Warlock.",
  "it was afternoon for sure.",
  "but the force was so thick.",
  "that it looked like midnight in there.",
  "why is it so dark.",
  "well the forest is too thick.",
  "and the Pixies have suddenly lost their light.",
  "I will have to go in alone.",
  "the Pixies are vulnerable without their light.",
  "look who's here.",
  "what a pleasure to have Royals at my doorstep.",
  "good that you were out of your dungeon yourself warlock.",
  "give the Wonderstone back to these Pixies and you shall be pardoned.",
  "I am so scared.",
  "oh no help help.",
  "aren't you cute King Sullivan.",
  "King Sullivan took out his lasso.",
  "and attempted to capture the Warlock.",
  "but the Warlock kept dodging him.",
  "the fairy had said that the way to defeat this pose him to Pure light.",
  "it means the Sun.",
  "but the forest is too thick.",
  "wait it is not just the light of the Sun.",
  "the Pixies Beam with Purity too.",
  "you all are much more powerful than he is.",
  "because you are pure at heart believe in yourselves Pixies.",
  "and let your heart Shine the brightest light.",
  "on the other hand warlock was overpowering the king.",

  "enough games.",
  "now it's time to say goodbye.",
  "don't you dare.",
  "you use your powers for your selfish gains.",
  "and we will never let you win.",
