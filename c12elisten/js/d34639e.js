  "For Porkpie.",
  "He needs to pay his TV licence.",
  "After all the money I paid out for him and he walked out.",
  "Now he wants me to give him £40 for a TV licence?.",
  "- No way.",
  "- No, he doesn't know.",
  "Gloria, Louise and me are doing it for a surprise.",
  "No. Not after the way he treated me in front of all those people.",
  "And he hadn't even apologised.",
  "He didn't ask for the party.",
  "That was your idea.",
  "- No.",
  "- He would've really liked a TV licence.",
  "- No!.",
  "- All we need is another 40.",
  "Probably a weekly rent on that phone of yours.",
  "So?.",
  "OK. What about making an investment?.",
  "- Ah. What in?.",
  "- Me.",
  "- Good job.",
  "- I had some business to take care of.",
  "- I've got my £13.",

  "I've got my five. Plus my 10% increase, making a grand total of 5.50.",

  "- Where did you get that from?.",
  "- Michael.",
  "- Michael?.",
  "Yeah, man, me and bro are like this.",
  "- How did you get that out of him?.",
  "- You don't know how to talk to him.",
  "There's a language between a man and bank manager.",
  "- What did you say?.",
  "- I'd wash his car the next six months.",
  "- You get a kiss.",
  "- Keep those lips to yourself.",
  "Now, if Louise wants to give me a kiss...",
  "Mwah!.",
  "- How are you, Desmond? Shirley?.",
  "- You know how we is.",
  "We'll feel better when that silly old fool Porkpie come out of hiding.",
  "Name that tune.",
  "- What kind of tune is that?.",
  "- That is music from Senegal.",
  "Well, you can send it back.",
  "I'm not in the mood.",
  "I went to see him last night. No answer.",
  "- What do you think we should do?.",
  "- We should wait till he come back.",
  "- He's gone round there.",
  "- Afternoon all. How goes it?.",
  "- Yes, what's happened? Who's died?.",
  "- Nobody's seen Porkpie since the party.",
  "Ah. That's very interesting.",
  "I gave Sean £40 to go round to help pay for his TV licence.",
  "- Did you?.",
  "- I hope he's all right.",
  "- Sean's run off with the money.",
  "- Michael.",
  "How you could say a thing like that about your brother, hm?.",
  "If Sean say he wanted the money for Porkpie licence, that's what he's done.",
  "You tell him, Mum.",
  "Anyway, he didn't give me the money.",
  "I've got to clean your car for six months, remember?.",
  "Michael, how could you?.",
  "Easily, he's a capitalist.",
  "A face of capitalism has no heart.",
  "It's all right to be a capitalist when you need money.",
  "That's the only good reason to have a capitalist in the house.",
  "- You have the money, we spend it.",
  "- Stop arguing.",
  "Louise, you seen Porkpie today?.",
  "- No.",
  "- What have you done with the money?.",
  "- Spent it.",
  "- On what?.",
  "Look, we put it in an envelope and popped it through his letter box.",
  "Porkpie!.",
  "I don't really know how to say this because I don't like charity.",
  "But I want to thank you all for helping me.",
  "It made me realise that sometimes you can't fight alone and you have to ask for help.",
  "So, I want to thank you for your help and your friendship.",
  "I know it's a bit late but I'd like to give this to you, Shirley.",
  "And say, \"Happy birthday.\".",
  "Aw, thank you, Porkpie. Mwah.",
  "They're very nice.",
  "But these must've cost the earth.",
  "I can't accept them.",
  "I didn't pay that much for them.",
  "I got them from Lee.",
  "Oh, really? Well, if you don't mind me asking, Porkpie,.",
  "- how much you pay for them?.",
  "- You can't ask a man a thing like that.",
  "- How much?.",
  "- Excellent value, rolled gold, a pound.",
  "Well, it's the thought that counts, eh, Porkpie?.",
  "Yes, it's a nice present, Porkpie.",
  "Hm.",
  "No matter how much they cost.",
  "But for you, cheapskate, it's the cost that counts."
