  "once upon a time there lived the king and his wife who ruled the mezzaland kingdom in peace and prosperity.",
  "the queen was pregnant and both of them were expecting their little angel to be born.",
  "that was a boy named logan.",
  "however he had an extra big and long nose which covered half of his face.",
  "what's going on why did this happen to our kid.",
  "that was because three years ago when the king had just been crowned.",
  "he fell in love with the queen who was still a beautiful princess at that time.",
  "she lived in an old castle thanks to the support of an old fairy.",
  "the king knew that the princess had been hexed and detained in this castle by a witch.",
  "the witch cast a spell to conjure a big snake.",
  "which watched the princess day and night.",
  "to save her you should enter the castle when the snake is sleeping.",
  "if you are able to kill it the princess will be free.",
  "that night the young king snuck into the bedroom of the princess.",
  "where a big snake was rolling and sound asleep.",
  "however the princess was really worried for him.",
  "the young king swung the sword at the snake it immediately vanished into dust.",
  "the young king happily held the hand of the princess.",
  "he said get out of here with me.",
  "the princess happily accepted.",
  "they escaped the castle together.",
  "however while they were on the run.",
  "everything was detected by the witch.",
  "the princess was too scared.",
  "she screamed out loud and fainted.",
  "how dare you high my beloved snake.",
  "i curse your child he will have to bring a long and big nose and he will never know what is happiness.",
  "back at the palace the young king was so worried.",
  "however because of the happiness he was having with the princess.",
  "he quickly forgot all the threats of the witch.",
  "then they celebrated their wedding.",
  "the queen listened to the full story of the king.",
  "then they discussed to find out the best way to help their kid have a happy life.",
  "we will never say that logan's big nose is ugly.",
  "it will only make him feel embarrassed.",
  "let the little prince believe that his big nose is perfect.",
  "you're right if so our little logan will be happy forever after.",
  "then the king and queen ordered all the servants to ignore the flaw on logan's face.",
  "they replaced all the pictures in the palace by the portraits of ones who had a big and long nose.",
  "when logan was a kid.",
  "he had been taught about the famous and beautiful persons the royal heroes all of them had long and big noses.",
  "all of logan's friends also had their roses.",
  "in order to be the friend of logan they had to wear fake noses which made their nose look bigger and longer than usual.",
  "in front of logan everyone always complimented his long and big nose.",
  "logan prince your nose is so wonderful it's the standard of beauty.",
  "i wish i had a nose like yours.",
  "but when logan was out of their sight.",
  "they gossiped and made fun of his nose.",
  "just like that the prince grew up and he always proudly thought that his big and long nose was the standard of beauty.",
  "logan had always looked down and despised people with small noses small nosed.",
  "servant you're just an ugly poor man.",
  "you will never be able to serve me.",
  "a wonderful prince everything kept going until one day logan was introduced to some princesses for marrying one of them.",
  "everyone had a long and big nose they.",
  "all met the royal standard.",
  "but roger's instinct told him to leave it aside.",
  "until he saw the picture of mia.",
  "wow a princess from the neighboring rentford kingdom.",
  "although she had a small nose.",
  "roger immediately fell in love with her at first sight.",
  "she had a small nose but that doesn't matter i love her and accept all of her imperfections.",
  "that's what a real man should do.",
  "so he determined to ask for the permission of his parents to propose to princess mia.",
  "this made the king and queen so delicate.",
  "i'm not sure whether she will agree to marry roger or not.",
  "and if she agrees then one day she will probably ridicule his nose.",
  "and her son will not be happy anymore.",
  "they had not yet decided but the news.",
  "about the sudden disappearance of princess mia had been transmitted to the palace.",
  "logan made up his mind.",
  "so the king and the queen had no choice.",
  "but to allow logan to go find and rescue princess mia.",
  "this was also the first time logan went out without the protection of his parents.",
  "he was quickly lost to an abandoned savannah.",
  "loken was exhausted and hungry.",
  "he suddenly saw a beautiful house in front of his eyes.",
  "he was so glad that he stepped closer to the house and knocked on the door.",
  "there was a noble old woman with a small nose welcoming him.",
  "hello oh why do your nose look so strange.",
  "it is the biggest nose that i have ever seen.",
  "oh i'm sorry i didn't intend to make fun of you.",
  "but it is really funny.",
  "she dared to make fun of my perfect nose.",
  "isn't her nose too small.",
  "if i weren't hungry i would definitely teach her a lesson.",
  "he said.",
  "madame i am prince logan from the mezzaland kingdom.",
  "and i'm really hungry right now.",
  "instead of talking about my nose i hope you have something for me to eat.",
  "oh you are the son of my good friends.",
  "the king and the queen of mensa land.",
  "come in son however i still love to talk more about your nose.",
  "maybe you don't know but i'm your parents close friend.",
  "did they tell you anything about a giant snake.",
  "however that snake was not as big as your nose.",
  "she is so impolite and she even talks too much.",
  "why doesn't she realize her own imperfection.",
  "yeah her flattering servants have hidden the truth.",
  "made her believe that she is gentle.",
  "if that were me i would never be fooled like that.",
  "because i know myself well or to be exact.",
  "i have no flaws.",
  "the prince would never think that he was the one who was being fooled.",
  "everyone made fun of him behind his back.",
  "like he had done to the old woman.",
  "logan this nose really doesn't make you sad or bother you every day.",
  "madam has anyone told you that you talk too much.",
  "and that you are so rude you have a small nose.",
  "it's ugly my nose is the standard of beauty and i'm proud of it.",
  "thanks for the meal but i cannot stand.",
  "it anymore.",
  "i will leave here and go find my beloved princess mia.",
  "come on son i just want to help you.",
  "mia princess are stuck in the crystal palace.",
  "which is not far from here the only way to rescue her.",
  "is that you should kiss on her hand.",
  "and then you will probably feel something.",
  "a country person with a small nose like her.",
  "how can she understand that a respectable king should have a big and long nose.",
  "anyway she has done a good job when she showed me the way to rescue mia.",
  "on his way logan met a few villagers.",
  "they all had small noses.",
  "they giggled and pointed to gossip about logan's big and long nose.",
  "look a guy with a creepy giant nose.",
  "his nose is even longer than the face of his horse.",
  "that's too funny the doubt started to creep into logan's mind.",
  "it's weird the people in this kingdom all have a small nose.",
  "but why do they all look so confident.",
  "logan remembered again all the girls with big noses were rejected by him.",
  "and he only cared about the beautiful princess mia with a small nose.",
  "but logan had yet to admit that his nose was too big.",
  "he got used to the compliments about his nose.",
  "that's because the people in this country all have such small noses.",
  "they are completely different from the standards in our country.",
  "finally logan reached the crystal palace.",
  "it was covered by a garden full of tangled vines.",
  "logan tried to squeeze himself.",
  "he crept through thorny bushes and vines wrapped around.",
  "because of an extra big nose.",
  "sometimes logan was stuck.",
  "the vines wrapped around his nose.",
  "along with the thorns piercing his flesh.",
  "causing him great pain and discomfort.",
  "does that hurt why can't i slip through but my nose cannot.",
  "was it because was it too big impossible.",
  "but because of his love for princess mia.",
  "logan was still trying to overcome this challenge.",
  "he even got a rope made of vine.",
  "the prince threw the rope onto the balcony.",
  "then clung to it and began to climb up.",
  "princess mia i'm here to rescue you.",
  "you are here my prince.",
  "don't worry i know how to save you believe me.",
  "but when logan intended to kiss mia's hand.",
  "he realized that his lips couldn't touch her hand.",
  "because of his extra big and long nose.",
  "this happened so many times.",
  "and this was when logan realized that his nose had been a burden.",
  "mia i am sorry but i cannot do it.",
  "i have to admit that my nose is too big.",
  "i have never been disappointed with it before.",
  "all of the kingdom had hidden the truth.",
  "and fooled me that my nose was the standard of beauty.",
  "and all the nobles also had that kind of nose.",
  "i ignored the frank words and assumed myself.",
  "that my nose is truly perfect.",
  "i also despised and made fun of people with small noses.",
  "without knowing that it was me who had been so funny and pitiful.",
  "now i have to admit that this nose is really a flaw of mine.",
  "and i have to live with it for the rest of my life.",
  "princess mia i don't deserve to be with you anymore.",
  "anyone who are able to overcome difficulties to save me will totally be deserved with my love.",
  "right after that an old fairy appeared beside them.",
  "with a kind smile.",
  "you are the woman in the house at the savannah.",
  "you kept reminding me of my nose why are you here.",
  "logan i am your fairy godmother.",
  "you had been cursed and had to live with this big nose.",
  "only when you realized yourself that it is your flaw then the curse will be dissolved.",
  "oh my nose now it's getting back to normal great.",
  "my son anyone will have his own imperfection.",
  "and you should realize it and learn how to accept it to become a better person.",
  "then prince logan was able to kiss princess mia on the hand to express his love.",
  "mia was really happy and accepted.",
  "they went back to mexican and presented the king and the queen.",
  "we have been totally wrong for a long time.",
  "we shouldn't have covered the truth and deceived him like that.",
  "that was really unfair for him.",
  "we should let him realize this sooner.",
  "since then logan and mia lived happily ever after with a precious lesson that they would never forget."
