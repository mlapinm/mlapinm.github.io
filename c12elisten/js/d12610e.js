  "it seems that this speaker doesn't have good quality.",
  "for example the bluetooth connection is worse.",

  "yes of course.",
  "how were you using the speaker when you tried to connect to the headphone.",
  "what kind of question is that.",
  "i understand your upset miss i'm just trying to understand the problem.",
  "i'm afraid it's not our policy to replace the speaker because of glitches.",
  "i just connected it to the phone according to instructions.",
  "i have two phones and all of them can't connect to the speaker.",
  "usually the bluetooth can't connect because the bluetooth speaker connects to other devices.",
  "for this case you have two phones maybe both of the bluetooth on your phones is on so that the speaker can't detect it.",
  "to overcome this you can turn off the speaker and turn it on again.",
  "before that you must make sure there is.",
  "only one bluetooth on.",
  "ok but what about the switch on button that doesn't work properly.",
  "we are sorry that you've had a problem with this speaker.",
  "we'll check the switch on button with our technicians and get back to you immediately.",
  "okay that will work for me.",
  "but i think you also have to check the connection too.",
  "of course i will make sure about the connection too.",
  "could you leave your contact and address.",
  "we will contact you soon.",
  "sure here it is we'll do our best.",
  "to get your speaker working as soon as possible.",
  "dialogue with a coworker on the solution for the said complaint.",
  "hey rio how's your morning going so far.",
  "hey deara it's fine until you came here.",
  "so what's the problem this time.",
  "bingo there is one customer who complains about this bluetooth speaker.",
  "what's happened.",
  "she claims this speaker has a worse connection than it should be.",
  "and then the switch on button doesn't work properly.",
  "okay i'll check it for a while.",
  "it seems the wire in the speaker is broken.",
  "it will affect the switch on button so i will repair the wire.",
  "okay what about the connection.",
  "meanwhile for the connection you can tell the customer to check if there is another bluetooth connection that connects to the speaker.",
  "if it still doesn't give any effect.",
  "try to turn off and turn it on again after a few minutes.",
  "i tried to explain to the customer but she told me to check it again.",
  "and didn't listen to me.",
  "so i don't know how to explain this when i see her again.",
  "of course you are confused but seeing this speaker reminds me of another way.",
  "you can take the brochure on the table between the two cabinets.",
  "oh what is this.",
  "this brochure contains pictures and.",
  "instructions on how to connect this bluetooth speaker to the headphone.",
  "i make this for customers who are not familiar with current technology.",
  "after they see the picture in the brochure they can practice it directly.",
  "so they can immediately understand how to use it without many questions coming up.",
