  "Hey in today's English lesson, I'm going to teach you how to answer any English question in three easy ways.",
  "Using the simple rule of threes.",
  "Well, then I am teacher Tiffani.",
  "Let's jump right in.",
  "So let me explain first what the rule of threes actually is.",
  "You see, it basically says provide enough support for your thoughts, ideas, and opinions by giving three details.",
  "Three examples or three reasons.",
  "This is the simple rule of threes that my English teachers actually taught me.",
  "So let me explain the first part part number one, three details.",
  "Now the first part of this rule focuses on the important details of the topic, subject or person you are discussing.",
  "In other words, you want to help your list.",
  "Visualize what you are talking about now, remember, I'm showing you three different ways to answer any question.",
  "So let's take a look at the question and the first way you can answer this question.",
  "So it's actually about American culture.",
  "Here's the question greeting.",
  "How do people in your country normally greet each other?.",
  "Simple response.",
  "We normally wave our hands back and forth, but using the first part of the rule of threes, I can give three details.",
  "Waving that's a detail.",
  "Second big smiles.",
  "And third, ask a question.",
  "Now, what I'm doing right now is using the first part of the simple rule of threes, giving three details.",
  "So the question, now, let me show you how this will turn into a natural English response.",
  "Here we go.",
  "Here's the response now, including each of my three details, many people know that Americans normally greet each other by waving their hands back and forth.",
  "But to be honest, our greetings involve much more than just waving our hands.",
  "We usually weigh bat each other.",
  "Give a big smile and then ask each other a question.",
  "You see, I gave the three details.",
  "The questions can vary, but usually they are related to how the other person has been doing since we last saw them.",
  "This is a fluent English response to the question about, Hey, how do people usually greet each other in your country?.",
  "Now you'll notice there are two things bolded.",
  "The first thing is to be honest.",
  "So let me explain this to you very quickly, what it means, to be honest as you're seeing in the response.",
  "So to be honest, this just means it's.",
  "Before, or after a statement to indicate that you are telling the truth about your own opinions or feelings, especially if you think these will disappoint this person or the person you are speaking to.",
  "So right here, I said, but to be honest, Our greetings involve much more than just waving hands.",
  "So I said to be honest, because many people not living in America assume that this is all we do just waving our hands, but I continued supporting my answer by giving three details, the waving, the smiling, and then the asking of a question.",
  "So again, to be honest, this is used when you're indicating that, Hey, I am telling the truth about my feelings or my thoughts on this topic.",
  "We say to be honest, now the other one is right here.",
  "Very, very V a R Y.",
  "Now this means to change in form appearance, nature, substance, et cetera, or to alter or modify, or to make different from one another.",
  "Now in my response, I said, the questions can vary.",
  "Meaning there can be different questions.",
  "How was your day?.",
  "How have you been, Hey, I haven't seen you in a long time.",
  "What have you been doing for the last 10 years?.",
  "So again, the questions can be different.",
  "So for part one, the question again, Hey, TIFF.",
  "In your country, how do people normally greet each.",
  "I gave three details.",
  "We wave, we give big smiles and then we ask a question.",
  "Now that's the first way to answer the question, but what if we have the same question and we want to use part two of this simple rule of threes.",
  "Let's look at the exact same question and how to answer it in a different way.",
  "And remember part two involves giving three examples.",
  "So the second part of this rule focuses on examples of the topic, subject or person you are discussing.",
  "In other words, you want to help your listener understand more by giving them real life examples situations.",
  "Remember in part one, we just gave three details.",
  "We didn't give any examples or examples situations.",
  "We were using part one.",
  "Now, part two.",
  "How can we answer the same question with three examples?.",
  "So remember the question the.",
  "Greeting.",
  "How do people in your country normally greet each other response?.",
  "We normally wave our hands back and forth.",
  "Now, remember, this is the same response from the first part, right?.",
  "But now the supports are going to be different instead of supporting details.",
  "We're going to give supporting examples.",
  "So watch this example, number one.",
  "Students greet their teacher during a virtual lecture example, number two, friends, greet each other during a video call and example.",
  "Friends greet another friend's parents.",
  "So now we have three examples to support our response.",
  "Remember, remember the simple rule of threes.",
  "It's all about supporting your response in three different ways.",
  "So three examples.",
  "Now, what will our response look like to the exact same question here?.",
  "Here's our response in my country.",
  "People normally wave their hands back and forth when they greet each other.",
  "For example, students sometimes greet their teachers by waving their hands during a virtual.",
  "My students do that as well.",
  "After our class, you can also see friends waving to each other during video calls, as they shoot the breeze at the mall.",
  "Finally, it is common to see friends waving their hands.",
  "As they greet their other friends, parents, you see what happened, same response.",
  "People normally wave to each other.",
  "In my country, but now my support for the same response is in the form of examples, you can do the exact same thing to speak English fluently, like a native English speaker.",
  "Now I want to explain one thing to you.",
  "Shoot the breeze.",
  "Now shoot.",
  "The breeze just means to relax and, or talk to someone about things that are not very serious or important.",
  "My friends and I, we were on the phone.",
  "Hey girl, what you do?.",
  "Nothing.",
  "I'm just sitting here looking at TV.",
  "What you doing?.",
  "We're just shooting the breeze, relaxing and talking on the phone.",
  "Maybe you do the same thing with your.",
  "So in English we say, shoot the breeze.",
  "So we understand now following part two, we have examples that are supporting our response, the exact same response from part one, but now we're using different supports.",
  "So what about part three of the simple rule of threes?.",
  "Again, the exact same question.",
  "But now we're going to use part three.",
  "Now, part three, as a reminder, three reasons.",
  "The third part of this rule focuses on giving specific reasons for your ideas on the topic, subject or person you are discussing.",
  "In other words, you want to help your listener understand your thought process and how you developed your idea.",
  "All of these things.",
  "There are part of speaking English fluently, like a native English speaker, things that I learned when I was in high school.",
  "And now you're learning that you can sound like a native English speaker.",
  "So again, the exact same topic, the question once again, greeting, how do people in your country normally greet each.",
  "Response.",
  "We normally wave our hands back and forth, but now we're going to support that same response with three reasons.",
  "Check out my reasons.",
  "Here we go.",
  "My reason, reason, number one, it grabs the attention of the other person.",
  "Reason.",
  "Number two, big waves imply that you are genuinely happy to see the.",
  "And reason three it's more welcoming and inviting.",
  "So now as you're listening to my response, you're probably like, wow, that does make sense.",
  "So let me give you my response, including my three reasons.",
  "Here's what the response would be in my country.",
  "It is very common to see people waving their hands back and forth when they greet.",
  "One of the main reasons people wave is because it grabs the attention of the other person.",
  "Another reason is that when you spread your fingers out and wave, it shows that you are genuinely happy to see the other person finally waving is common because it's more welcoming and inviting.",
  "The other person feels like you are encouraging them to have a conversation with you.",
  "Think about this.",
  "Look at me right now.",
  "I'm going to say hi.",
  "Hey, how are you now?.",
  "Tell me think about this now.",
  "Hey, how are you suddenly the feeling is different, right?.",
  "It seems a bit more welcoming and invite.",
  "Just proved my reason, one of my reasons to support my answers.",
  "So again, I have my three reasons to support my response right here in this response.",
  "Now I do want to go over two of the expressions and words from this response, actually three, the first one is grabs the attention.",
  "Now this just means to cause one to be.",
  "Interested in something.",
  "Think about it a few moments ago.",
  "I said, hello.",
  "And then I waved my hand and I said, hello, I got your attention.",
  "Right?.",
  "Again, grabs the attention causing you to be more interested, right?.",
  "The next one is genuinely, genuinely.",
  "Now this just means really and sincerely, and to explain this one, I said, this wave is very different.",
  "From this wave.",
  "When I spread my fingers, it seems more inviting like, Hey, this is more genuine right now.",
  "If someone ways that you like this, it's not bad, but this is a lot more genuine.",
  "All right.",
  "Again, sincere.",
  "Now the last one is welcoming, friendly, or making you feel welcome again.",
  "Hey, come on.",
  "How are you?.",
  "I want to talk to you a bit more again, I gave you three reasons to support my response.",
  "So once again, I want you to use this simple rule of threes.",
  "Part one.",
  "Just simply giving three details, part to simply giving three examples and part three, simply giving three reasons.",
  "You can answer any question in English using the simple rule of threes.",
  "Hope you enjoyed the lesson.",
  "Remember to keep speaking English.",
  "You still there?.",
  "Ah, you know what time it is?.",
  "Come on, sing it with me.",
  "It's story time.",
  "I said it's story time.",
  "All right.",
  "For today's story.",
  "I want to tell you something that happened to me when I was in the sixth grade, my niece, one of my nieces is actually in the sixth grade right now.",
  "And I was telling her this story a few weeks ago.",
  "So when I was in the sixth grade, my school classes started.",
  "I think 8:00 AM, but we were allowed to get to the school between seven, 15 and seven 30 in the morning, because many of our parents had to get to work early.",
  "So the school allowed parents to drop kids off early and there would be a teacher there to kind of supervise.",
  "So I was one of the students that would arrive at school early because my dad had to go to work very early.",
  "At that time, he worked at IBM with.",
  "So anyways, I would get to school early and a few other friends and we'd just talk and, you know, have fun.",
  "But one day we got a new game.",
  "It was tabletop pool.",
  "It was a pool table that you could sit on top of desks, but instead of balls, they were these little circles with holes in them and they were flat.",
  "So we would have the cue stick and we would hit them the same way you would hit a pool.",
  "So my friends and I, we started playing in the morning, but as time went on, our other friends started hearing how much fun we were having in the morning before school started.",
  "So it started off with three of us being the early bird students.",
  "Then another student came and there were four of us.",
  "And there were five of us then were seven.",
  "Then there were 10.",
  "Then there were 11.",
  "Everyone wanted to get to score early so that they could play tabletop pool with their class members.",
  "By the end of that school year, almost our entire class, about 20, 20, 2 of us at that time.",
  "Would come together every morning and play tabletop pool.",
  "Now I want you to think about this.",
  "We were in sixth grade, we were only about 11 or 12 years old and we would bag our parents.",
  "Please take me to school early.",
  "Take me to school.",
  "Mommy and daddy.",
  "I want to get there early now.",
  "Now in 2022, when I'm recording.",
  "How many of you have children that are begging you to take them to school early times have definitely changed, but that will always be one of my most precious memories having fun in the morning before school started playing with my friends and it was very healthy competition.",
  "We'd play two at a time and then we'd take turns and we had so much.",
  "So I hope later in life when I have kids, my kids also make memories like that with their friends.",
  "I hope you enjoy this story guys.",
  "And I'll talk to you next time."
