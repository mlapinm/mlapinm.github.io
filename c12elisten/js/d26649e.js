  "once upon a time in a peaceful village there lived a kind farmer named dominic.",
  "his parents passed away prematurely left him a small garden with a hovel in the corner of the garden.",
  "dominic was really hard working.",
  "he worked from early in the morning to late at night.",
  "day after day of trying to take care of his garden.",
  "finally dominic could have a wonderful and green garden.",
  "every day after taking care of the garden dominic brought vegetables and fruits to the market to sell them.",
  "his vegetables and fruits were all fresh.",
  "therefore his stall was always full of customers.",
  "until one day when he sold his goods out.",
  "and was about to go back home.",
  "he noticed an old woman who was in rags in the corner of the market.",
  "she was selling something but no one cared and of course no one bought her goods.",
  "they even chased her away because they thought that the old woman would bring bad luck to them.",
  "with her ragged appearance.",
  "hey the ragged old woman stay away from me and my stall.",
  "i haven't been able to sell anything because of you.",
  "feeling sorry for her dominic came closer to ask after the old woman.",
  "then he gave her some gold coins to help.",
  "how long have you been sitting there.",
  "you haven't been able to sell anything right.",
  "i don't want to buy anything but you can keep this money to get something to eat.",
  "thank you kind guy i have this tinderbox for you.",
  "it can help you whenever you have difficulties.",
  "dominic was surprised but he still took.",
  "the tinderbox that the old woman gave him.",
  "it's a beautiful tinderbox in gold color.",
  "after that he put the tinderbox in his pocket.",
  "then he thanked the old woman and quickly left.",
  "everything kept going peacefully.",
  "dominic's business ran smoothly.",
  "he finally could afford a better house for himself.",
  "in replacement for the hovel before.",
  "and he totally forgot about the existence of the tinderbox.",
  "but things would never be peaceful forever.",
  "when everything was about to support dominic.",
  "then one day a flood came and swept out the village.",
  "all the properties of the villagers had gone.",
  "and the garden and the house of dominic were not the exceptions.",
  "dominic sat there with a stone face.",
  "he knew nothing to do and he could only gather all the broken pieces left.",
  "suddenly he saw something was glowing in one corner of the mess.",
  "that was the light from the gold tinderbox of the old woman.",
  "he recalled all the things the old woman had told him.",
  "he immediately used that tinderbox.",
  "a smoke rose then a man appeared.",
  "hello i'm the one who have lived in that tinder box for such a long time.",
  "waiting for someone to comment free me.",
  "and now you are my master i can fulfill any of your wish.",
  "really that's great.",
  "can you bring my house and my garden back like before.",
  "i really don't know what to do.",
  "the god confidently said.",
  "it's really simple to me.",
  "he swung his hand to cast a spell.",
  "in the second the house and the garden were back to normal like nothing had happened.",
  "dominic was really delighted.",
  "he exclaimed.",
  "thank you thank you so much.",
  "although dominic could get all the things back.",
  "he would never forget all of his neighbors.",
  "he used much of his properties to help the villagers who had to suffer from the consequences of the flood.",
  "and everything was gradually back to normal.",
  "dominic brought vegetables and fruits to sell at the market again.",
  "one day suddenly dominic saw people were gathering together to see the notice on the wall.",
  "he was so curious that he came closer to sea.",
  "it turned out that the king wanted to select the husband for the princess.",
  "but he only allowed the princess of the neighbor kingdoms to take part in.",
  "and normal people would not have a chance to attend.",
  "as soon as dominic saw the notice.",
  "he knew that he was falling in love with the beautiful princess.",
  "from that day he dreamed about the princess every day.",
  "he suddenly remembered that he could ask for help of the god in the tinderbox.",
  "when he immediately used it to summon the god.",
  "the god said my master you have something to ask me.",
  "sir i want to meet and talk to the princess every day.",
  "no sooner had he finished his last words the god casted a spell again and in just a second the princess appeared right in front of him.",
  "the princess was startled while seeing dominic.",
  "she asked where am i and who are you.",
  "your highness i'm the one who sells fruits and vegetables at the market.",
  "i really admire your beauty and intelligence so i asked my guardian angel to bring you here to have an opportunity to talk with you.",
  "the princess was really surprised at first.",
  "but after a while she felt more comfortable and they kept on talking to each other until the next morning.",
  "and things kept going that way every evening the princess was brought to dominic's room by the god to meet him.",
  "then before the sun rose the princess would be sent back to the palace.",
  "the two young people gradually fell in love with each other.",
  "the princess became happier than ever her maid asked her when seeing that.",
  "your highness what makes you happy these days.",
  "i can see you smile all the day.",
  "with her honesty the princess told the whole story to the maid.",
  "recently there has been a god who came here and brought me to the house of dominic a kind man who sells fruit at the market.",
  "i feel really comfortable when talking to him.",
  "but the princess didn't expect that the maids had reported this story to the king.",
  "the king was really angry he ordered the soldier to find dominic.",
  "so jeff go to dominic's house and bring him to execution place.",
  "yes sir the villagers rumored while seeing dominic was transferred to the execution place.",
  "they didn't understand why such a good man as dominic could be treated like that.",
  "why can't dominic be executed it's weird.",
  "it's really strange what did he do to become an executing prisoner.",
  "before being executed he wished very much to smoke a pipe.",
  "as it would be the last pipe he should ever smoke in the world.",
  "it was an innocent request was often granted to a poor criminal before he suffered death.",
  "do you want to say something before you die.",
  "i want to smoke the last pipe in this world.",
  "all right he can do this.",
  "dominic just waited for that he used the tinderbox the smoke rose then the god appeared as usual.",
  "no one will be able to harm my master when i'm here.",
  "my master is a good man he helped all the villagers after the flood.",
  "why could you do that with such a kind man like my master.",
  "then he swung his hand the executor was blown off the gallow.",
  "that's right dominic is our benefactor.",
  "he is not a bad man.",
  "citizens below also insisted on supporting dominic.",
  "right after that dominic also explained why the princess still went to his place every day.",
  "your majesty i'm just a farmer who has really admired the princess.",
  "so i asked this god to bring her to my place to have the opportunity to approach her.",
  "but i didn't force her and never had the intention to kidnap her.",
  "after the first meeting i can feel that we were good together and i also asked for her permission before bringing her there the next times.",
  "right father dominic is a kind guy.",
  "and i voluntarily went to his house to gossip every day.",
  "i feel really comfortable being with him.",
  "getting to know about dominic and what he did to the villagers.",
  "the king could understand why he could get support of everyone.",
  "even the princess also supported him.",
  "dominic now i know that you're a really good man who is favored by everyone.",
  "and it seems like my daughter also loves you by all her heart.",
  "alright i agreed to marry her to you.",
  "their wedding took place in the palace of the king with the presence and blessings of everyone.",
  "some time later the king passed away.",
  "dominic and the princess lived happily and ruled the kingdom in peace and prosperity.",
  "once upon a time in a far away kingdom.",
  "there lived a talented and wise magician named noah who lived on a majestic mountain.",
  "he had a young student named jacob who was an extremely lazy and playful boy.",
  "that's right run run away.",
  "goodness my precious medicinal plants.",
  "whenever his master put him in charge.",
  "he would immediately try to get evasion and go back to noah's word.",
  "jacob go into the woods to cut down a bundle of firewood and bring back to me.",
  "master i'm going through so much pain so i can't go far at all.",
  "also this is out of my duty isn't it.",
  "all right i will have the trees cut.",
  "what you need to do is fetch the water in the garden.",
  "having carried only two bottles of water but i feel tired to death.",
  "it's time to take a rest under this tree.",
  "jacob forgot all his works and slept like a log under the tree.",
  "when noah came back he felt really discontented.",
  "and decided to chastise jacob.",
  "pretending to be contrite and let everything pass.",
  "jacob put all his master's lessons behind.",
  "then he kept behaving like that for many times which made the magician very upset.",
  "until a spring afternoon when many trees and flowers had come into bloom.",
  "jacob was engrossed in playing in a garden in the mountain.",
  "he looked away and saw that the shades of delicious and riped berries emitted a brilliant bread.",
  "i want to taste them but it was late afternoon and the route was also very far away.",
  "maybe i should come home and ask for my master's permission first.",
  "then i might prepare to set out early tomorrow.",
  "master by tomorrow could you let me go to the forest under the mountain to gather some berries.",
  "don't ever think about it.",
  "there is a witch taking refuge in that forest if you unluckily met her you would be hexed and detained for the rest of your life.",
  "maybe my master has been so senile that his thoughts have become erratic or illogical.",
  "but what if it's not true.",
  "i think that someone made up that story.",
  "tomorrow when i come back in the evening you will know it's a complete fabrication.",
  "this boy is so rebellious no matter what i say.",
  "he will still set out tomorrow.",
  "okay as my amulets will protect him.",
  "i will teach him a lesson this time.",
  "okay i agree to let you go.",
  "keep these three amulets if there is any danger on the way they can save your life.",
  "yeah thank you very much.",
  "the next morning jacob crossed a long distance to reach that beautiful forest.",
  "being engrossed in the beautiful forest and gathering delicious wild red berries he forgot the way back.",
  "only when it was already dark jacob realized in panic that he had lost his way.",
  "i got lost this is so scary here at night what would happen if the witch appeared right now.",
  "oh hello young man.",
  "who is that.",
  "he saw an old woman with a gentle kind appearance smiling at him she.",
  "smiled and moved toward jacob don't be scared i live in this forest.",
  "what are you doing here at night.",
  "i come here to pick wild fruits.",
  "however i was engrossed in playing i forgot the way to get back.",
  "and then got stuck here.",
  "poor you.",
  "let's come to my house to take a rest and eat something.",
  "how lucky i am to meet such a kind and gentle old woman.",
  "thank you so much.",
  "however jacob did not know that she was the cruel witch disguising herself as an old woman.",
  "bringing him to her house the witch fed jacob the food with sleeping medication inside to make him fall asleep.",
  "just put him in this room first pour this little naive lamb.",
  "how on earth could he think that i'm a kind old lady.",
  "when the witch left.",
  "the three amulets in his body glowed to counteract the sleeping medications effect.",
  "when jacob woke up he found himself in a small room.",
  "where am i where is the old woman.",
  "oh why does my head ache in the way like this.",
  "feeling so strange he went around the house to look for the old woman.",
  "when he reached a room with the light on.",
  "he cracked open the door slightly and looked inside.",
  "seeing the woman nowhere.",
  "he just saw a witch making strange potions.",
  "how lucky i am today to catch such a healthy prey.",
  "tomorrow is the full moon day it's time the portion i've prepared for so long did it work.",
  "he will be the first one to test it.",
  "so she is a witch i have to escape here now.",
  "who's that she caught jacob immediately.",
  "so it's you how could you wake up so quickly.",
  "are you you are are you a witch.",
  "probably because my sleeping medications are not strong enough.",
  "you're right i'm standing which you can never escape from here.",
  "the witch imprisoned jacob in the other room and locked it carefully.",
  "at midnight while sani was guarding outside she saw the light was still on.",
  "have you slept yet.",
  "i'm so scared so i can't sleep.",
  "boy try to make your last night count.",
  "time flew jacob was really frightened and regretful.",
  "it's all my fault i disobeyed my master when going to the forest.",
  "and don't know how to get back.",
  "so now i was trapped by the cruel witch.",
  "if only i had listened to his advice.",
  "wait what about masters three amulets.",
  "please fake my voice to answer the witch.",
  "the amulet lighted up and jacob's wish had been fulfilled.",
  "so happy he was he hurriedly found a way to climb up to the roof and escaped in the night.",
  "meanwhile the witch was still watching outside.",
  "seeing that the light in the room was still on she asked suspiciously again.",
  "boy are you still there why are you not sleeping.",
  "i'm so scared so i can't sleep.",
  "seeing that the witch was relieved.",
  "then she slept until dawn.",
  "that all night jacob had been wandering to find the way to get out.",
  "it was not until dawn that he escaped the forest.",
  "then he rushed to the mountain without daring to take a rest.",
  "when the witch woke up she opened the door and ordered.",
  "wake up and go with me it's morning already.",
  "she looked around the room in shock.",
  "there was only a amulet on the table.",
  "i'm so scared so i can't sleep.",
  "how dare a boy like you trick me.",
  "let me see where on earth can you run.",
  "sani caught up with jacob very soon because of her magic.",
  "no matter how fast he ran the witch could quickly chase after him.",
  "stop you can never run away.",
  "jacob took out another amulet while running.",
  "my amulet please turn into a river to prevent the witch from catching me.",
  "it immediately turned into a large river blocking the way.",
  "stanley was rushing forward she slipped and fell into the river.",
  "happy as he was jacob didn't dare to stop.",
  "he kept running.",
  "however the witch drained dry the river quickly and test chasing after jacob.",
  "stop there it's nonsense you will not be able to escape.",
  "jacob quickly took out the last amulet and said.",
  "my amulet please turn into a flame to stop her.",
  "the amulet rapidly turned into a sea of flame and surrounded the witch.",
  "you insolent boy i will catch you by all means.",
  "fanny sprayed all the water that had just been absorbed from the river to put out the sea of flame.",
  "after that she continued to chase after jacob.",
  "luckily his master's house was in front of him.",
  "he quickly ran toward him.",
  "master please help me.",
  "sanny the witch is chased after me here.",
  "no i won't it's none of my business.",
  "jacob was stunned to realize that he was so selfish and lazy.",
  "please forgive me for my rebellion i have bothered you so much.",
  "from now on i promise you that i will never behave like that again.",
  "i will change.",
  "never forget this lesson.",
  "hey magician hand him over so that i will not harm you.",
  "he is my student how could i hand my student to you.",
  "you think that i'm afraid of you.",
  "i just don't want to get into trouble if not even you would be in trouble too.",
  "what about having a transformation competition.",
  "if you win do whatever you want.",
  "how ridiculous i can change into any form in this world.",
  "how could i lose to a mere magician like you.",
  "the magician chanted incantations so that he turned into such a giant person.",
  "see can you do this.",
  "as a piece of cake.",
  "salmon was not inferior at all.",
  "she even could disappear without reciting the amulet.",
  "good job but i bet that you won't be able to turn into something small like a pot of water.",
  "even i cannot do so.",
  "you lame watch and see.",
  "she immediately turned into a pot of water.",
  "just waiting for that the magician quickly trampled the pot.",
  "the talented sanny was easily defeated due to her own.",
  "since then the country had become peaceful without the cruel witch.",
  "the forest had been more flourish and lusher than before.",
  "jacob also received a lesson for himself.",
  "no longer being lazy and selfish.",
  "jacob started listening to his master's words.",
  "listening to the right advice is always a good thing isn't it."
