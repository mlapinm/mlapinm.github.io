  "what would you like to discuss.",
  "well do you think a dress code is necessary in our school.",
  "i don't think so.",
  "i want our teachers staff and students to have freedom in choosing outfits.",
  "i mean i think it's important for the teachers to have a dress code.",
  "to make us more professional and help students focus.",
  "why do you have that idea.",
  "specifically i wanna talk about miss linda.",
  "well everyone can see that she's a great teacher right.",
  "but uh-huh do you mean you want to talk about her clothes.",
  "yes i don't think short skirts and crop tops she wears to school are appropriate.",
  "i mean her teaching is amazing but i don't think every student will pay attention to it.",
  "instead they will chit-chat during the lessons about her outfit.",
  "is that so.",
  "every morning i can hear some male students talking about her outfit in a really weird way.",
  "it's not a funny topic to discuss every day like that.",
  "i think i know what you mean.",
  "i can recognize it too.",
  "but since linda you are a woman.",
  "it would be better if you talk to her rather than me about this.",
  "well i tried to bring it up but it seemed like she didn't get what i mean sir.",
  "i see.",
  "okay let's have a meeting tomorrow to talk about dress code.",
  "thank you so much for listening to my sharing.",
  "you're welcome.",
  "you did a great job sally.",
  "career choice.",
  "hey andy.",
  "what's up tim.",

  "wow wait young man.",
  "first of all congratulations but why don't you choose creative rather than.",
  "watson why should i choose creative.",
  "watson offers me 25 higher salary than my old company.",
  "and i believe they are a really professional environment.",
  "i can get promoted easily if i work well.",
  "yeah but i heard that watson's environment is really toxic.",
  "also employees here are not so friendly but really competitive.",
  "don't you think that you will be under stress man.",
  "well i think the stress i'm gonna have equals the salary i will receive.",
  "it's worth a try right.",
  "wait think about creative.",
  "they are a diverse environment with people from everywhere.",
  "you can work with full potential while enjoying a friendly and open workplace.",
  "i think that notion is quite naive you know.",
  "there will be no friendly and creative workplace like this in reality.",
  "maybe people just make it up.",
  "how about the pollution that watson has created recently.",
  "have you read the news about watson dumping chemicals into the ocean recently.",
  "if i were you i would work for an environmentally friendly company like creative.",
  "bro really how can you believe such nonsense news like that.",
  "come on i think choosing watson will be a big mistake.",
  "wait for me bro.",
  "i will drive you around america with my mercedes soon.",

  "actually not even though in my mind i knew i brought it because i knew it was out of battery.",
  "yeah.",
  "but at the same time i thought oh maybe i didn't bring it.",
  "maybe i'm drunk and it was just a dream.",
  "keep going.",
  "and then we stopped finding it.",

  "sorry but.",
  "i'm not quite keen on those kinds of games.",
  "oh really that's fine.",
  "do you have any suggestions.",
  "i don't know but i'd love to do something with.",

  "oh i see.",
  "but it's not good to scroll on your phone for a long time.",
  "can you suggest anything to me.",
  "i just don't want to go outside in this hot weather.",
  "i've read the newspaper recently.",
  "and it recommends playing chess or any kind of board game when you're at home.",
  "moreover you can exercise with yoga it's good for your health tom.",
  "but we need more than one participant to play those games you've mentioned.",
  "and yoga is definitely not my cup of tea mom.",
  "i think we might go on a picnic in the afternoon tom.",
  "what do you think.",
  "where should we go on such a scorching hot day mom.",
  "well i know a place with a lot of trees.",
  "i think we could be harmonious with nature once.",

  "where is that place mom.",
  "is it in the forest.",
  "well not really but i bet you will love it.",
  "all right.",
  "which clothes should i wear for this afternoon mom.",
  "i suggest t-shirts and shorts.",
  "i think it's a good idea mom.",
  "they're suitable in this weather.",
  "oh there's also a lake which is safe for swimming.",
  "would you like to bring your swimsuit as well.",
  "i think i will mom.",
  "it would be great to swim on a hot day.",

  "how about nature.",
  "what.",
  "do you want to enjoy some activities with nature.",
  "that would be great.",
  "will we go hunting or something.",

  "of course this activity is suitable for people like you and me.",
  "we prefer something peaceful and alone i guess.",
  "you got me bro.",
  "great so after the fishing should we cook every fish that we catch.",
  "that's okay.",
  "why not bring a few of them for our families or relatives.",
  "definitely.",
  "we can even sell them.",
  "but i think it'd be better to grill them and eat near the place we go fishing.",
  "that's exactly what's on my mind.",
  "fantastic.",
  "what else should we do after that.",
  "well how about we camp overnight.",
  "oh i'm quite scared when i have to live in the dark so.",
  "that's okay that idea is not really suitable anyway.",
