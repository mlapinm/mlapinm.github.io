  "Hi guys.",
  "Welcome back to English with Max.",
  "I know it's been a couple of weeks since I last uploaded a video.",
  "One of the reasons is that it's been really hot in my region.",
  "I did try to film a video the other day but there was literally sweat dripping off my face and I didn't think that would look very good on camera.",
  "Anyway, today I am going to talk to you about euphemisms.",
  "\"What is a euphemism?\" you may ask.",
  "A euphemism is simply a word or an expression that is used to replace other words or expressions that might be considered a bit rude, or too direct, blunt, or unpleasant.",
  "Today I'm going to give you five examples.",
  "The first one is: between jobs.",
  "This simply means unemployed.",
  "Obviously it sounds a little bit nicer to say, \"I am between jobs\" than to say \"I'm unemployed\". Some people also say: \"I am keeping my options open.\" The second one is a relatively modern euphemism and it's one that is quite often used by hipsters.",
  "It is saying \"vintage\" instead of \"old\". Something isn't old anymore.",
  "No, no, no, it is \"vintage\". Vintage.",
  "Number three: five-finger discount.",
  "This one means shoplifting.",
  "What is shoplifting?.",
  "Shoplifting is when you go into a shop and you steal.",
  "It's not going to the cash register and threatening the person behind the counter with a weapon.",
  "It is simply putting something in your pocket or your bag without paying for it.",
  "Now, five-finger discount makes sense because we have five fingers on our hand.",
  "Number four: privates.",
  "Another variation of this is \"private parts\". This simply means genitals.",
  "Male or female.",
  "There are actually quite a lot of euphemisms for genitals, but I don't want to overwhelm you with too much today.",
  "The last one is: to be in one's birthday suit.",
  "This means to be naked, because when you were born you weren't wearing any clothes.",
  "It's very logical.",
  "That's all for today, guys.",
  "I'm pretty sure that euphemisms exist in most languages, but I'm not a hundred per cent sure.",
  "So if euphemisms are used a lot in your native language, please let me know in the comments below.",
  "It would also be great if you could provide an example, as well as the literal translation in English.",
  "I hope you enjoyed the video.",
  "If you did, please remember to share it with your friends and also remember that you can follow me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
  "I'll put the links in the info box below.",
  "See ya next time.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jymvAyl-f-s&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=34\">See ya next time.</a>",
  "Hi guys.",
  "Welcome back to English with Max.",
  "In this video I'm going to talk about five very common English idioms.",
  "If someone asked me what my favorite idiom was, I wouldn't be able to answer because I like quite a lot of them.",
  "So for this video I've chosen five that I like a lot and that are also very common - native speakers use these a lot.",
  "They also very current.",
  "I don't want to teach you old-fashioned ones that only our grandparents might use.",
  "Maybe I'll do that in another video.",
  "OK, let's get started.",
  "The first one is: you can't have your cake and eat it too.",
  "Literally this might not make sense to some people because some people think: \"Well, if you are having your cake, you are eating it as well.",
  "It's the same thing.\" But the idea behind this idiom is that you cannot eat your cake and still have it in front of you.",
  "The figurative meaning is that you cannot have two things that are incompatible.",
  "Another way to express this is: you can't have it both ways.",
  "Here is an example: Frank wants to go play with George, but Frank has an exam tomorrow and needs to study, otherwise he will fail.",
  "So I could say to Frank: \"You can't have your cake and eat it too.\" Another example is someone saying: \"I want to go to Paris when it's hot, but I don't want to go when there are lots of tourists.\" Well, when it's hot there are lots of tourists.",
  "So yeah, you cannot have your cake and eat it too.",
  "Many languages have an equivalent for this expression.",
  "I'm going to give you some examples and I will put the literal translations of these in the subtitles.",
  "In French the expression is: On ne peut pas avoir le beurre et l'argent du beurre.",
  "(One can't have the butter and the money from the butter.) In German a close equivalent is: Mann kann nicht auf zwei Hochzeiten tanzen.",
  "(One can't dance at two weddings.) And in Spanish you can say: No se puede estar en misa y repicando.",
  "(You can't be at mass and ringing the bell.) The R is really hard for me in Spanish.",
  "For the other idioms in this video I'm not going to give you any translations or equivalents, because what I would like you to do, is try to think of idioms in your own language which express the same ideas.",
  "Sometimes there isn't an equivalent in another language, but often there is.",
  "Please write it in the comments below, if you can think of it, and it would also be great if you could put the literal English translation.",
  "The second one is also related to cake and it is: It's a piece of cake.",
  "Of course native speakers often say: It's a piece-a-cake.",
  "This simply means that something is very easy to do.",
  "For example, cooking pasta is a piece of cake.",
  "For most people anyway, I hope.",
  "Or, watching reality TV is a piece of cake; learning a language is not.",
  "You should also be aware that in the UK and Australia we have a more vulgar form of this expression.",
  "And that is: It's a piece of piss.",
  "I'm not suggesting that you use this expression because you could very easily offend people, but it is good if you understand it.",
  "On a side note, I know that the word \"pis\" in Spanish is something that you often use with children, but that is not the case with \"piss\" in English.",
  "\"Piss\" is quite vulgar and it's definitely not a word that you use with children.",
  "Number three: nothing to write home about.",
  "This means mediocre, nothing spectacular nothing special.",
  "The idea behind this is that you would not sit down and write a letter to your family about something.",
  "It can apply to many things: food, movies places, events.",
  "For example, I could say to you: \"How was the movie?\" \"Nothing to write home about.\" Or: \"How was the Justin Bieber concert?\" \"Nothing to write home about.\" The fourth one is: to bite off more than you can chew.",
  "This means to try to do more than you are able to do.",
  "I'm pretty sure most of you know the word \"bite\". It's that.",
  "But some of you might not know the word \"chew\". \"Chew\" is what you do to food when it's in your mouth.",
  "We do have the word \"masticate\" in English.",
  "I know that in some Romance languages the word is similar: \"mastiquer\" in French, \"masticar\" in Spanish.",
  "But we don't use \"masticate\" very often.",
  "Firstly it's quite formal, and possibly also because it sounds like another word which starts with \"m-a-s-t\" and ends in \"a-t-e\". Yes, I know, I really need to grow up.",
  "When would you use this?.",
  "Well, for example, you're at work and your boss comes to you and says: \"Can you please send these emails, research this topic, file these documents and then look at those accounts?\" And you say: \"Yes, yes, no problem.\" But then at one o'clock in the morning when you're still in the office working, you might say to yourself: \"I think I've bitten off more than I can chew.\" The last one for today is: to add insult to injury.",
  "This means to make a bad situation worse.",
  "I used this in my train travel video, which you can watch by clicking right here or clicking on the white box above.",
  "I was complaining because I had to get up early, and to add insult to injury it was also raining.",
  "What a hard life.",
  "But this can be used in many situations.",
  "For example, the flight wasn't very pleasant because there was a lot of turbulence, and to add insult to injury there was a baby sitting behind me.",
  "Or: my boyfriend left me and to add insult to injury he announced it on Facebook.",
  "Bastard.",
  "That wouldn't be very nice would it, Frank?.",
  "We have come to the end, guys.",
  "I hope you enjoyed this video.",
  "If you did, please share it with your friends.",
  "And remember to try to think of idioms in your own languages that express the same ideas.",
  "You can write those in the comments section, and it would be great if you could put the English translation.",
  "You can also follow me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
  "I'll put the links in the info box below.",
  "See you next time.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3_en3IcIas&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=33\">See you next time.</a>",
  "Hi guys, welcome back to English with Max.",
  "It's been quite a while since I last filmed a video, but anyway, I am back and today I have a video for you on the difference between the words \"client\" and \"customer\". Most of you watching this probably have an intermediate to advanced level, so I'm guessing you have heard the words “customer” and “client”. But lots of people learning English don't know the difference.",
  "This is partly because in many languages, there's just one word.",
  "In Spanish, for example, it's \"cliente\", and it's very similar in Italian.",
  "In French it's \"client\" and in German it's \"Kunde\". What makes it more confusing is that sometimes you can use the words interchangeably, and even native speakers sometimes don't know which word to use.",
  "However, and this is the good news, there are some general rules which work most of the time.",
  "Let's first look at the word “customer”. A customer is a person or a group of people who buy goods from a shop or a business, or who pays for services from a big company.",
  "You have customers in supermarkets, in electronic stores, bookshops, clothing stores, and even in cafés and restaurants.",
  "Sometimes people use the word “diner” for a person who eats in a restaurant, but you can also use the word \"customer\". An example of a customer paying for a service is the case of phone and internet companies.",
  "For example, you, yes you, are a customer of the company that provides your mobile phone service.",
  "You are also a customer of your electricity company.",
  "A client, on the other hand, is a person or a group who pays for professional, individualised advice or services.",
  "Lawyers have clients, so do accountants, therapists, financial advisors, interior decorators, etc.",
  "As I said earlier, sometimes you can probably use either, that is, you can use them interchangeably.",
  "For example, does a person who creates websites have clients or customers?.",
  "Is it a good or a service they're providing?.",
  "I'm not sure.",
  "In my opinion you could say either in that case.",
  "You should also be aware that nowadays some businesses refer to their customers as “clients” because “client” somehow sounds a little more formal or important.",
  "But that's just marketing bullshit.",
  "It's very silly, isn't it, Frank?.",
  "In summary, normally if what is being provided is a good, you say “customer”, and if it's a service, you say “client”. The exception is if the service comes from a big company (like telephone or electricity companies) and the service is not specifically adapted to your needs – thousands of other people are receiving the same service as you.",
  "I'd also like to point out that sometimes you say neither “customer” nor “client”. If you see a doctor, you aren't a customer or a client, you are a patient.",
  "And if you are paying a teacher for lessons, you are a student.",
  "I hope that was clear.",
  "If you still have any doubts about this, you can leave me a comment.",
  "Or if you just want to practise your writing, you can leave a different comment.",
  "I do have a challenge for you: leave a comment stating a type of business that I haven't mentioned in this video and whether they would have customers or clients.",
  "I would also like to know if there are two words for this concept in your language (like in English), or if you just have one word.",
  "Remember you can follow me on social media.",
  "I have Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.",
  "The links are in the info box.",
  "And if you liked the video, let me know by giving me a thumbs up, and share it with your friends.",
  "Bye bye!.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lqddu-OnqM&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=32\">Bye bye!</a>",
  "Hi guys, welcome back to English with Max.",
  "This is just a very short video on the two main meanings of the phrase “I'm afraid.” First let's look at the obvious meaning, which most of you probably know.",
  "“Afraid” can simply be a synonym of “scared” or “frightened”. You can just say: “I'm afraid.” Or you can be afraid of something.",
  "For example, lots of people are afraid of the dark.",
  "I'm afraid of frogs.",
  "But I'm not afraid of spiders.",
  "Considering I live in Australia, that's not very logical.",
  "We can also use this phrase to express a sense of regret, and it's often used to soften or lessen the effect of an unpleasant statement.",
  "People often use it in an apology.",
  "For example, you might say: \"I'm sorry, I'd love to come to the party, but I'm afraid I'm busy that day.\" Doctors often use it to deliver bad news.",
  "Like: I've looked at the results, and I'm afraid you have chlamydia.",
  "Normally when people use it, it's used sincerely I think, but occasionally it is used sarcastically.",
  "For example, I'd love to come to the football match, but I'm afraid I'd rather watch paint dry.",
  "I hope you liked this video.",
  "If you did, please give me a thumbs up.",
  "If you want to practise using this phrase right now, you can go to the comments section and write one sentence telling me something that you're afraid of.",
  "And another sentence in which you express a sense of regret.",
  "Remember that you can follow me on social media.",
  "I'll put the links in the info box.",
  "And don't forget to subscribe.",
  "See you next time.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGgPedAkp_c&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=31\">See you next time.</a>",
  "Hello everyone.",
  "Welcome back to English with Max.",
  "Today I have a tip for you that will not only help you sound more like a native speaker, but will also help you in those moments when you can't find the precise word to describe something in English.",
  "It's something that native speakers use all the time, but for some reason I've never seen it in an English textbook.",
  "Are you ready for it?.",
  "It's using the suffix \"-ish\". Now some of you might be thinking: \"What's a suffix?\" A suffix is simply a letter or a group of letters added to the end of an existing word.",
  "For example, you can add \"-ful\" to the word \"help\" to make \"helpful\". Or you can add the suffix \"-less\" to the end of \"taste\" to form \"tasteless\", which means something has no taste.",
  "It's probably not a good word to use if your boyfriend or girlfriend cooks you dinner.",
  "Piece of advice.",
  "Anyhow, \"-ish\" is a suffix that can be added to nouns or adjectives.",
  "If you add it to a noun, it can mean \"being like\" or \"having the characteristics of\". For example, \"babyish\" means like a baby.",
  "Babyish.",
  "\"Apish\" means like an ape.",
  "Apish.",
  "You can also add it to numbers and then it has the sense of \"close to\" or \"approximately\". For example, you could say: \"I don't know how old my teacher is, but I would say seventyish.\" That means that you think your teacher is about 70 years old.",
  "No, Frank, I'm not seventyish.",
  "The number starts with a \"T\". As I said before, you can also add it to adjectives.",
  "If you add \"-ish\" to an adjective, it has the sense of \"somewhat\" or \"kind of\" or \"rather\". For example, \"smallish\" means somewhat small.",
  "\"Longish\" means somewhat long.",
  "\"Blackish\" means somewhat black.",
  "It's very common to add \"-ish\" to adjectives that have one syllable, and normally those are the ones that you find in the dictionary because nowadays they are just accepted as standard words.",
  "However, in casual spoken English, native speakers often add \"-ish\" to any adjective they want.",
  "For example: \"There's a funny-ish smell coming from my refrigerator.\" That means there is a somewhat funny or strange smell coming from my fridge.",
  "Knowing how to use \"-ish\" is very useful when you can't think of a precise word.",
  "When we speak a foreign language this happens quite frequently because we don't have the same range of vocabulary as we do in our native language.",
  "Let's take the example of colours.",
  "Normally in our native language we know more than just the basic red, yellow, green, blue, white, etc.",
  "Look at some women when they shop for wedding dresses.",
  "Suddenly dresses are no longer just white.",
  "No, no.",
  "They are ivory, cream, off-white, eggshell.",
  "I think you get the point.",
  "Anyhow, if you don't know all those different words for white, but you know something isn't pure white, then you can say \"whitish\". I think the equivalent in French is \"blanchâtre\" and in Spanish it's \"blanquecino\". You can also sometimes use \"ish\" to answer certain questions.",
  "Then it just means kind of or somewhat.",
  "But be careful, this is very colloquial when used in this way.",
  "Here are some examples: \"Did your exam go well?\" You could answer: \"Hmm... ish.\" That means that it went okay.",
  "Another example: \"Is your new flatmate nice?\" You could say: \"Mmm... ish.\" And we all know what that means.",
  "That is all for today, folks.",
  "If you would like to practise using this, you can write me a sentence in the comments below using a word with \"-ish\". Alternatively, you can write a question that can be answered with \"ish\" by itself.",
  "Thanks very much for watching, everyone.",
  "As usual, don't forget to like and subscribe.",
  "You can follow me on social media.",
  "Yes, I'm cool... And I'll see you next time.",
  "Bye bye!.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFH4IDXaMO0&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=30\">Bye bye!</a>",
  "Hi guys, welcome back to English with Max.",
  "I am doing this video because I received a request from Letizia, who is one of my Italian viewers, to talk about the words \"factory\" and \"firm\". So I thought I could do a short video on places of work.",
  "We'll look at the words \"factory\", \"business\", \"company\" and \"firm\". Firstly, the word \"factory\". This is very easy.",
  "A factory is simply a building or a group of buildings where large quantities of goods are made by machines.",
  "Obviously, there are also people working in factories, but a large part of the work is done by machines.",
  "Unless you live in a cave, and if you're watching this, then you probably don't, unless it's a cave with really good Wi-Fi... Anyway, unless you live in a cave, I'm guessing most of the objects in your home were made in a factory.",
  "Frank was probably made in a factory.",
  "Just like George.",
  "Although I don't think they like hearing that.",
  "They probably weren't made in Australia either.",
  "Yeah, just as I expected: China.",
  "In French \"factory\" normally translates as \"usine\", in Spanish it's \"fábrica\", in Italian it's very similar to that (\"fabbrica\"), and in German it's \"Fabrik\". The word \"fabric\" does exist in English, but be careful, it is a false friend.",
  "Normally \"fabric\" means \"cloth\" in English.",
  "\"Cloth\" is the stuff that clothes are made of.",
  "Now let's look at these words: business, company and firm.",
  "These words can be a bit confusing and even native speakers often struggle to define them.",
  "The word \"business\" is the most general term.",
  "If you look it up in the dictionary, you will see many many definitions, and obviously I'm not going to go through all of those.",
  "But normally, if we say \"a business\" we are talking about an operation that provides goods or services in order to make a profit.",
  "A business may be very small, employing just one person, or it may be very large, employing thousands of people around the world, like Coca-Cola or Apple.",
  "Many people use the words \"business\" and \"company\" interchangeably, but normally when we say \"company\" we are referring to something a little bigger than the bakery across the street.",
  "A company also usually has a very specific legal structure and that will vary from country to country.",
  "Some are huge, like \"Coca-Cola\" or \"Apple\", but a company might just employ about 50 people.",
  "And remember the pronunciation: it's \"cAHmpany\" not \"cOmpany\". And finally the word \"firm\". This word is also rather general and technically you can use it interchangeably with the word \"business\". However, in reality when native speakers hear the word \"firm\", they normally think of businesses that are made up of partners.",
  "For example, a law firm or an accounting firm.",
  "I've also heard advertising firm and architectural firm.",
  "But apart from those four examples you won't hear this word very often.",
  "Except if you study economics.",
  "I studied a bit of economics at university and economists often use the word \"firms\" to refer to businesses in general.",
  "Thanks very much for watching, everyone.",
  "Feel free to leave a comment in the comments section down below.",
  "Don't be shy.",
  "I really like getting comments.",
  "Maybe you can use one of these words in a sentence.",
  "Hit the thumbs up if you liked the video.",
  "Don't forget to subscribe, and remember you can follow me on social media... if you want.",
  "See you next time!."
