  "it's a type of virus.",
  "viruses are tiny particles that we can't see with our naked eyes.",
  "they're not visible to us but can make us sick.",
  "it can stick to our lungs and our lungs help us breathe.",
  "so people who get the monster virus might experience difficulty in breathing.",
  "they might also experience tiredness constant fever body pain or cuff.",
  "oh my god that sounds painful.",
  "what happens when we get the monster virus.",
  "well generally young people and children are able to recover because mostly the immune system is strong enough to fight the virus.",

  "that is why we need to take care of ourselves and everybody around us to stop the monster virus from spreading.",
  "yes we need to be responsible to protect ourselves and everybody around us.",
  "but tia how does the virus get to us.",
  "does it have legs to walk to us or does it have wings.",
  "oh no tofu thankfully the virus can't walk or fly to us.",
  "the virus needs our help to get into our body.",
  "suppose someone with the monster virus sneezed into their hands.",
  "and touched this railing.",
  "the virus can get from their hands to the railing.",
  "another person comes in and touches the railing on the same place.",
  "and gets the virus on their hands.",
  "that is why it is important to continuously wash or sanitize our hands.",
  "after touching anything especially in a public place.",
  "that's how the virus spreads from one person to the other.",
  "if we are not careful enough.",
  "then i must not touch anything.",
  "and if i do i'll sanitize or wash my hands.",
  "correct tia.",
  "that's right tofu.",
  "what is the gatekeeper doing tia.",
  "he's checking our temperature to see if we have fever.",
  "we should stay home if we experience any such symptoms.",
  "hmm okay.",
  "what's on the floor.",
  "these are labels to keep distance.",
  "social distancing is very important.",
  "we should avoid being in close spaces.",
  "and we should always keep a distance of at least six feet or two arms length from people while we're in a public place.",
  "that's why i stopped you from hugging grandma as she just traveled on a public transport.",
  "and there might be a chance of getting infected with the virus.",
  "the virus takes maximum 14 days to start attacking our body.",
  "hence grandma will be under quarantine for at least 14 days before we can meet her freely.",
  "okay.",
  "i will maintain social distancing.",
  "why are we doing that.",
  "because i exchanged money at the grocery store.",
  "exchanging money can be a big source for the spread of the monster virus.",
  "after all prevention is better than cure.",
  "yes tia.",
  "prevention is definitely better than cure.",
  "you must not touch your face tofu.",
  "the virus gets into your body through your eyes nose or mouth.",
