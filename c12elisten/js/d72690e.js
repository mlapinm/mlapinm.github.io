  "Tip 1 - Standing outside.",
  "before you do anything you need to know.",
  "how to stand outside because the problem.",
  "with outside is that there's all these.",
  "little ups and downs that you might not.",
  "notice when you're walking but your.",
  "wheels will find them all i'm standing.",
  "in a t position so this is helping me to.",
  "stop gravity because if i stand like.",
  "this.",
  "i'm gonna go.",
  "so i'm standing in a t position you.",
  "could also use a v.",
  "anything that puts your wheels against.",
  "gravity will stop you from rolling if.",
  "you're more comfortable you can do it.",
  "like that like this.",
  "but not straight.",
  "when you skate outside it's always safer.",
  "Tip 2 - Staggered Stance.",
  "to keep as many feet on the floor as.",
  "possible.",
  "so what i use is what's called the.",
  "staggered stance now this is what ramp.",
  "skaters use because it helps you keep.",
  "your balance going up and down when.",
  "you're outside you never know when.",
  "you're going to find an up or a down.",
  "so it's good to always be prepared the.",
  "staggered stance is like this you can.",
  "choose whichever foot you'd like to have.",
  "in front whichever feels the most.",
  "comfortable you want to put all the.",
  "weight on the back leg and this is.",
  "what's going to hold you up so this is.",
  "your suspension here this front leg.",
  "hasn't got a lot of weight on it but.",
  "it's there for stability so if you get a.",
  "wobble you can shift the weight and you.",
  "can save it hopefully.",
  "how do we actually use the staggered.",
  "stance when we're skating.",
  "so.",
  "you can do some bubbles or some pushes.",
  "to get some speed and then hit the.",
  "staggered stance.",
  "so once you're in the stacker position.",
  "what i tend to do is a one foot bubble.",
  "because you very quickly lose momentum.",
  "let me just avoid this twig.",
  "so i hit this and then what i actually.",
  "do is i like to do it with my right foot.",
  "so i'll then swap my staggered stance.",
  "and i'll use this foot to keep my.",
  "momentum.",
  "and this works really well so i'm.",
  "finding oh i'm getting a bit fast i'm.",
  "going to hit my stagger again.",
  "and you lose some of your speed and then.",
  "tweak bubbles are great for twigs.",
  "i do them all the time.",
  "there we go.",
  "bit of momentum bit fast slow it down.",
  "bit faster again.",
  "now this is really really good because.",
  "it means that i've got both feet on the.",
  "ground so if i do hit a stone or i.",
  "misjudge one of my twigs.",
  "hopefully i can save it we've got to.",
  "Tip 3 - Controlling Your Speed.",
  "talk about controlling your speed.",
  "outside now you may notice that i've now.",
  "got a toe stop down this is because i.",
  "want to definitely not go anywhere.",
  "because i'm standing at the top of quite.",
  "a large hill.",
  "you need to be able to control your.",
  "speed so don't go outside until you have.",
  "at least one or two ways of stopping.",
  "quite confidently and i'll link to the.",
  "stopping video for you because it's.",
  "really really important that you know.",
  "how to stop before you hit an incline.",
  "and then you're in trouble as soon as i.",
  "lift my toe stop and go into a staggered.",
  "stance i'm just going to start rolling.",
  "because i'm on a hill now you can do.",
  "your t-stop but i tend to use my wheels.",
  "because i think the wheels are harder.",
  "than my toe stop but my toe stop is.",
  "going to wear down really really quickly.",
  "outside whereas my wheels they are going.",
  "to wear down too but they're not going.",
  "to wear down as fast as my toe stop if.",
  "you do notice wear on these inside.",
  "wheels then you can always move your.",
  "wheels around to even the wear out so.",
  "i'm going to go over here.",
  "and i'm going to hit my stagger.",
  "straight away i'm going to start moving.",
  "so i'm going to go into my t position.",
  "now obviously you can also do a plow but.",
  "sometimes the plow is harder to control.",
  "the speed this is a really steep hill so.",
  "this would be my preferred method for.",
  "dealing with a really steep hill.",
  "obviously you need to be able to skate.",
  "backwards to be able to do this.",
  "again just think about what you're.",
  "comfortable doing before you head.",
  "outside.",
  "so having just told you that i tend to.",
  "use my wheels to break outside rather.",
  "than toe stop because it wears it down.",
  "i've turned backwards and i've used my.",
  "toe stop.",
  "so when you apply this i talk about the.",
  "sweet spot with the toe stop so i'm on.",
  "my front two wheels and the toe stop is.",
  "just in and it's just enough to control.",
  "the speed without hopefully wearing it.",
  "down too badly having just enjoyed my.",
  "ride down the hill sadly to get home.",
  "Tip 4 - Uphill.",
  "i've got to go back up it again.",
  "so unfortunately you cannot keep both.",
  "feet on the ground when you're going up.",
  "the hill you just can't get enough power.",
  "from a bubble so you need to push and.",
  "i've got a video on this and i'll link.",
  "to that again for you but it's all about.",
  "the power it's a really good workout if.",
  "you're not quite comfortable with a big.",
  "push you can cheat it and you can use.",
  "your toe stops as well.",
  "i have to mention it i'm wearing all my.",
  "Tip 5 - Padding.",
  "padding and my helmet now you may notice.",
  "in some of my earlier videos i wasn't i.",
  "can vouch for the fact that it only.",
  "takes a couple of hard falls outside for.",
  "you to think.",
  "maybe.",
  "i should wear my padding basically with.",
  "padding i see it as a way of giving you.",
  "somewhere safe to bail to that isn't.",
  "your skin if i'm falling i need to put.",
  "my hands down i need to get my knees.",
  "down to get my body down to take the.",
  "impact but i can't do that if i've got.",
  "bare hands.",
  "obviously you can also always wear this.",
  "inside as well if it makes you feel more.",
  "comfortable.",
  "skating i think it's time to show them.",
  "kids what i'm capable of one thing.",
  "you're likely to encounter outside is a.",
  "curve so the best way to deal with these.",
  "Tip 6 - Kerbs.",
  "is to kind of sneak up on them.",
  "so what i mean is if you're rolling.",
  "along beside the curb is to step check.",
  "the traffic to step down.",
  "into the pavement this is a lot safer.",
  "than tackling it as if you were walking.",
  "up it so if you've got to stop and cross.",
  "the best way again is to hit it sideways.",
  "so a side step down then you can skate.",
  "across.",
  "and side step back up.",
  "if you do happen to come across a set of.",
  "steps when you're outside this is a.",
  "really good technique to tackle those as.",
  "well.",
  "so i hope some of the tips and tricks in.",
  "this video will help you gain a little.",
  "Bye Bye.",
  "bit more confidence skating outside now.",
  "if anyone knew what video to do for next.",
  "week thank you so much skady if you.",
  "happen to have a video about how to hop.",
  "downstairs due to a broken ankle oh yeah.",
  "baby i really hope brandon doesn't.",
  "actually need that video i'm katie.",
  "you've been watching skatey and i'll see.",
  "you next time bye.",

  "Intro.",
  "what wheels do you need indoors outdoors.",
  "big small hard soft i'm going to try and.",
  "answer all these questions for you let's.",
  "78a 60mm - Inside Test.",
  "start with the very softest wheel so.",
  "these are a 78a 60 millimeter so as a.",
  "fair test for each wheel i'm going to be.",
  "doing an edge a three turn a two foot.",
  "spin and a one foot spin however wearing.",
  "the 78 a's inside i can feel that a one.",
  "foot spin is going to be quite tricky so.",
  "i'm not going to try it because i don't.",
  "want to twist my knee and hurt myself so.",
  "straight away this is like skating.",
  "through syrup there's no forward.",
  "momentum it's all push.",
  "so it rolls but it feels like it stops.",
  "really quickly so let's try and do some.",
  "edges.",
  "oh yeah i can get a nice edge.",
  "let's try a three turn i'm glad i've got.",
  "my helmet on.",
  "okay.",
  "they're really catchy should we try a.",
  "spin.",
  "so my left foot is really dragging let.",
  "me try and go up higher onto the hill.",
  "okay so you have to really get those.",
  "front wheels up out of the way to be.",
  "able to spin so indoors these wheels.",
  "78a 60mm - Outside Test.",
  "didn't do very well but this is where.",
  "they should be outside so all the little.",
  "bumps and stones they're just taking it.",
  "and absorbing all the impact so my feet.",
  "aren't vibrating that much and they're.",
  "nice and smooth these wheels bashes.",
  "those stones aside.",
  "but they're only a 60mm wheel now i do.",
  "recommend a larger wheel outside because.",
  "some of the obstacles you'll encounter.",
  "outside can pose a problem.",
  "so as the same as it was indoors you.",
  "don't get a lot of roll with these.",
  "wheels because the softness.",
  "takes up the vibration and you lose.",
  "speed so there's always a bit of a.",
  "trade-off between speed and ride comfort.",
  "but i would recommend as a beginner it's.",
  "actually quite nice to not go too fast.",
  "outside but i would recommend to get.",
  "bigger than this look to the 63 mil or.",
  "the 65 mil because you will get a better.",
  "ground clearance the one thing you need.",
  "to be careful of if you go for the.",
  "biggest wheels the 65 mil is that the.",
  "wheel can start to touch on these little.",
  "nuts here and don't forget you're going.",
  "to get even closer when you start.",
  "leaning on your skate so before you.",
  "start skating make sure they're safe so.",
  "let's change to the next set.",
  "83a 64mm - Inside Test.",
  "what i'm wearing is my roll line helium.",
  "83a 65mm wheels they are my most.",
  "absolute favorite outdoor wheels and i'm.",
  "pretty sure i'm gonna hate them indoors.",
  "let's see straight away i prefer a.",
  "slippier wheel but they are really nice.",
  "to get a deep edge.",
  "because they don't slip so that's good.",
  "let's see if i can spin.",
  "okay they are slipping but i'm having to.",
  "lift my feet a lot more.",
  "so it's possible.",
  "let's try a free turn because normally i.",
  "would slip this.",
  "oh that really caught so actually.",
  "they're not that horrible if i was just.",
  "rolling around the ring they're actually.",
  "not that bad but they're not my.",
  "preferred wheel indoors what i will say.",
  "about these is they're 65 mil and i tend.",
  "to skate on a 57 mil that's my safe.",
  "place and when i put these on i felt.",
  "about 10 feet tall.",
  "so that's something to just think about.",
  "when you go to a bigger wheel and also.",
  "it means your toe stops higher from the.",
  "ground and that really caught me out as.",
  "well so let's try one foot spin in these.",
  "whoa.",
  "okay that's actually quite tricky.",
  "because my wheel isn't slipping it's.",
  "sticking to the ground so it's really.",
  "tricky to get into that spin 83a 65.",
  "millimeter indoors was actually a lot.",
  "nicer than i thought it would be if.",
  "you're wearing these outdoors and you.",
  "want to go to the rink for a skate.",
  "absolutely.",
  "they'll be fine and you know what i also.",
  "think for a beginner it's quite nice.",
  "that they're a little bit sticky because.",
  "it means you won't go quite fast i've.",
  "83a 64mm - Outside Test.",
  "got a big silly grin on my face now.",
  "because these are my favorite outdoor.",
  "wheels because they don't require me to.",
  "put in very much effort at all.",
  "i can do a couple of pushes and like the.",
  "78as they roll over the top of the.",
  "surface and absorb the bumps but because.",
  "they're a little bit harder they just.",
  "keep rolling but i haven't got to do too.",
  "much pushing and because they're bigger.",
  "i've got a better ground clearance.",
  "so with the last wheel i did a couple of.",
  "pushes and i didn't really get very far.",
  "but with this one i just keep rolling.",
  "however.",
  "not everyone wants more speed outside.",
  "the more speed outside helps when you're.",
  "dealing with obstacles so if you hit a.",
  "stick or something like that you're just.",
  "gonna obliterate the stick but you've.",
  "got to be ready for that extra speed.",
  "outside so don't go to a harder wheel.",
  "outside until you're really ready i'm.",
  "90a 60mm - Inside Test.",
  "now in a 90 a 60 millimeter wheel now i.",
  "think these are a really good middle.",
  "ground for indoors they're not too.",
  "slippy they're not too small they're.",
  "pretty perfect ice skated dances in.",
  "these when i was a competitive figure.",
  "escape so they were big so they roll for.",
  "days so one push and you can hold your.",
  "edge i know these are really nice for.",
  "edges because that's what i used to do.",
  "in all the dances let's try a three turn.",
  "again really nice for three turns.",
  "now they should still be pretty good for.",
  "spins too.",
  "it's a fair spin i can feel my left foot.",
  "grabbing slightly but it's still great.",
  "let's try the one foot so it won't be.",
  "too slippy stepping into it because it's.",
  "a nice edge.",
  "but it is going to be probably slightly.",
  "grabby yeah just a little bit a little.",
  "bit grabby as i'm trying to rotate.",
  "90a 60mm - Outside Test.",
  "so i think around an 85a is the top that.",
  "i'd wear outside but let's try the 90.",
  "and see how we get one.",
  "okay it's not too bad it's.",
  "a bit rattly i'd say that if your skates.",
  "come stock with a 90 you can always give.",
  "them a go outside but do bear in mind.",
  "that you're going to be much more.",
  "comfortable on something a bit softer.",
  "101a 57mm - Inside Test.",
  "these wheels are a 101 a and a 57 mil so.",
  "they're the top end of the a hardness.",
  "scale so technically a 101 isn't a thing.",
  "so you know when you say oh they did.",
  "really well they gave 110.",
  "you can't give 110 so i kind of see the.",
  "101 as a bit of a marketing thing but.",
  "they are very slippy and if you're not.",
  "used to super slippy wheels you're gonna.",
  "be like bambi on ice in these as you go.",
  "up the hardness scale it gets harder to.",
  "hold the edge.",
  "without a really really bent knee.",
  "because the wheel wants to flip out from.",
  "underneath you so you have to really get.",
  "your balance otherwise.",
  "it's going to slip.",
  "but.",
  "ah this is where the hard wheel comes.",
  "into its own the spins.",
  "so much easier and the turns are going.",
  "to be much easier as well because my.",
  "wheel's going to slip so i've got to be.",
  "careful as i step in on this forward.",
  "outside that my wheels don't slip out.",
  "but once i get to the spin.",
  "101a 57mm - Outside Test.",
  "it's a lot easier to spin so let's give.",
  "these ones a go outside.",
  "80D 57mm - Inside Test.",
  "no.",
  "so how come i've got a fifth set of.",
  "wheels to show you despite the last pair.",
  "being the top of the a scale at 101 or.",
  "100. i'm now wearing d-scale wheels now.",
  "these are like skating in granite.",
  "but these are actually my preferred.",
  "wheel because they are super super hard.",
  "and really slippy so these are an 80d 57.",
  "millimeter wheel.",
  "so because these wheels are super duper.",
  "hard it's hard to do a t push in them.",
  "because what they want to do is slip so.",
  "let me show you.",
  "so it's hard.",
  "so it's the sort of thing that you have.",
  "to over time adapt your technique.",
  "because you can push away in them.",
  "but it's just using your weight and your.",
  "edges correctly so once you've managed.",
  "to push away.",
  "you can do edges on these but again.",
  "you've got to be very very centered.",
  "otherwise the wheels will very very.",
  "easily slip away from you.",
  "but it does make a three turn.",
  "super easy because it just slips around.",
  "and likewise a spin is going to be super.",
  "easy too.",
  "so the one foot spin is going to be easy.",
  "but getting into it isn't going to be.",
  "easy.",
  "because this edge is going to want to.",
  "slip but once i'm in it it wants to spin.",
  "what you might find if you're doing.",
  "rhythm moves inside that you like a.",
  "slightly slippier wheel because you.",
  "haven't got to lift your feet.",
  "i'm not entirely sure what i'm doing but.",
  "80D 57mm - Outside Test.",
  "i thought i'd give them a go outside.",
  "come with me.",
  "lovely okay so there are times when you.",
  "want to wear a hard wheel outside bear.",
  "with me a lot of park skaters like a.",
  "harder wheel if you're in a concrete.",
  "bowl then you would want a hard wheel.",
  "for speed and for slips when you're.",
  "carving and turning it works really well.",
  "but when you're outside and you're.",
  "cruising and trail skating definitely.",
  "want something a bit softer for comfort.",
  "so when it comes to wheels always try.",
  "General Wheel Round Up.",
  "what you've already got because.",
  "investing in wheels can get expensive.",
  "and if you're going to a new rink and.",
  "you're not sure what wheels you need you.",
  "can always ask the regulars you may have.",
  "noticed during this video that i haven't.",
  "mentioned a lot of brands that's because.",
  "a lot of my wheels are so old you can't.",
  "buy them anymore so what i will do is.",
  "put in some links to wheels that are.",
  "available that work in each scenario.",
  "that we've spoken about i'm katie you've.",
  "been watching skatey and i'm going to.",
  "attempt to skate off in these really.",
  "hard wheels without anything bad.",
  "happening see you next time.",
  "you.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAcFwrQyX00&list=PLPHb4PtMjk0shrC0nwgRMvWwEDESn8KHc&index=21\">you</a>",
  "Intro.",
  "somebody recently asked me to do a video.",
  "on scissors.",
  "not those these scissors.",
  "scissors are great for beginners all you.",
  "need to be able to do is stand up do a.",
  "couple of bubbles and know and be.",
  "comfortable with a staggered stance all.",
  "Step One.",
  "we're going to do is a bubble so when.",
  "you normally do a bubble your feet come.",
  "back together so what we're going to do.",
  "is a bubble and go in to staggered.",
  "stance.",
  "now with the staggers downs it is.",
  "totally normal to be more comfortable in.",
  "one way than the other so work on your.",
  "favorite way first and then we can build.",
  "up to the side that doesn't feel as nice.",
  "let's talk about our weight so bubbles.",
  "Step Two.",
  "are the foundation of this move so you.",
  "really need to perfect those so i'll.",
  "link to a video we did just on bubbles.",
  "which will really help you your weight.",
  "on a bubble is on the inside edge of.",
  "your feet.",
  "so what's going to happen is you're.",
  "going to do your bubble on your insides.",
  "and then you're going to switch most of.",
  "your weight to this back leg because in.",
  "a staggered stance the weight is on the.",
  "back leg as i do my bubble my weight is.",
  "evenly distributed but as my legs start.",
  "to come in i'm going to put more weight.",
  "on the leg that's going to be the back.",
  "leg and then when as i move my legs.",
  "apart it equally distributes again.",
  "so far we've just been doing the one.",
  "stagger which we're comfortable with but.",
  "the idea is that you need to be able to.",
  "Step Three.",
  "change staggers.",
  "so that's what we need to work up to.",
  "next and this is a great skill to have.",
  "because say you're skating around the.",
  "ring or you're skating outside and your.",
  "staggered back leg starts to fatigue you.",
  "can do this move and swap staggered legs.",
  "once you're really confident with that.",
  "and doing both staggers in between your.",
  "bubbles we can move on to the next bit.",
  "now this gets a little bit harder.",
  "Edges.",
  "because we've been using our inside.",
  "edges on bubbles and now we're going to.",
  "use our outside edges so let me show you.",
  "what i mean.",
  "Step Four.",
  "this time when we hit the stagger our.",
  "feet aren't going to be straight they're.",
  "going to be at an angle.",
  "so here would be my stagger but my feet.",
  "are going to be.",
  "at an angle.",
  "and i'm going to press on my outsides.",
  "back to my bubble.",
  "so my feet are going to angle.",
  "outside.",
  "back to my bubble if you think back to.",
  "when we were using our staggered stance.",
  "the weight is more on the back leg and.",
  "it still is when i'm doing this because.",
  "less weight on the front foot allows it.",
  "to move easier.",
  "so once you've got this forward you can.",
  "also when you're ready try it backwards.",
  "Backwards.",
  "so once you've got this locked in in.",
  "forwards and backwards you can obviously.",
  "have a lot of fun with it make it your.",
  "own and it's surprising how often i.",
  "actually use it without thinking about.",
  "it.",
  "Bye Bye.",
  "i'm katie you've been watching skatey.",
  "and i'll see you next time."
