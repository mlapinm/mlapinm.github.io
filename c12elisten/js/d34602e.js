  "- We are.",

  "Uncle Scrooge.",
  "How can a ship be sunk in the desert?.",
  "So where's the water?.",
  "Ha-ha-ha-ha.",
  "Maybe this is just the beach.",
  "Sorry, Uncle Scrooge. We blew it.",
  "Nonsense. Real treasure hunters don't quit searching.",
  "Let's look at that map again, Huey.",
  "Look here, lads.",
  "Hey, that anchor hole looks like a compass point.",
  "Right as rain, Louie.",
  "Now, if that's north, then I guess we go in this direction.",
  "- Finally.",
  "- Don't hog it all.",
  "Aren't you tired, Uncle Scrooge?.",
  "Ach, I never get tired when I'm hunting for gold.",
  "A lot of good this stuff will do me in the desert.",
  "How do you say \"cool your jets\" in Spanish?.",
  "Don't know, but here's monsapi.",
  "Oh, no, the monsapis aren't a festival.",
  "- Well, what are they?.",
  "- They're torrential rains.",
  "\"Horrendous downpours that come once every hundred years.",
  "They flood the whole desert.\".",
  "And what's worse... Ahh, Uncle Scrooge!.",
  "You're in quicksand!.",
  "Oh, good. I thought I was getting weak.",
  "Quicksand!.",
  "Hang on! Louie, check the Junior Woodchuck Guidebook.",
  "\"Quills, quinine, quilting.\".",
  "- Forget that. Get a rope!.",
  "- Oh, yeah.",
  "Quick!.",
  "Ahh... Uncle Scrooge!.",
  "Uncle Scrooge!.",
  "Wait, Huey.",
  "You'll fall in, too.",
  "Well, we gotta do somethin'.",
  "What the...?.",
  "Uncle Scrooge, you're safe.",
  "I knew this underwater gear would come in handy.",
  "Nothing can keep Uncle Scrooge down.",
  "That's why I always come out on top.",
  "It looks like sabotage, lads.",
  "Someone's trying to beat us to the gold.",
  "But that's impossible.",
  "We got the only map.",
  "Oh, duck pajamas, he's escaped.",
  "Leave him, you fool.",
  "Let's get the gold.",
  "The gold is everything.",
  "Ah, you don't know Scrooge.",
  "He's like a money magnet.",
  "- He'll find the gold for sure.",
  "- I say we just beat him to the treasure.",
  "We have our own map made out of Scrooge's chocolate.",
  "And it's my map, so we'll wait here and stop him first... dead in his tracks.",
  "Estъpido. After I get my gold...",
  "Catch him!.",
  "He's got our supplies!.",
  "I'll head him off.",
  "He's coming your way, Uncle Scrooge!.",
  "1, 2, 3.",
  "Hee-hah!.",
  "This is how we used to do it on my cattle ranch in Wyoming.",
  "- Ride 'em, Llama Boy.",
  "- Whoa! Oof.",
  "- Are you all right?.",
  "- Fortunately, I landed on my wallet.",
  "- This ought to bury Scrooge.",
  "- Forget him. On to the gold.",
  "No. Better safe than sorry.",
  "Besides, the treasure boat's been sunk for 400 years.",
  "- It can wait a little longer.",
  "- But I can't.",
  "No!.",
  "Now Scrooge has the only map.",
  "I've got to save him.",
  "Whew, just in the nick of time.",
  "Oh, it was only lightning.",
  "Lightning?!.",
  "So that's the monsapis.",
  "You idiot. If you've lost me the gold...",
  "Don't worry, partner.",
  "We'll simply follow them.",
  "Yes, and then we'll take the map from them.",
  "I learned how to make these while hunting uranium in Borneo.",
  "It's called a Malaysian umbrella.",
  "Oh, no. A dead end.",
  "No one can sail a ship uphill.",
  "I've been fooling myself.",
  "You can't give up, Uncle Scrooge.",
  "Maybe if we searched one of these mountains.",
  "- Which one?.",
  "- The map'll say.",
  "We've been over it a million times.",
  "I'm finished.",
  "- But how can you just...?.",
  "- You don't understand.",
  "My whole life, I've worked and sweated to stay one step ahead of wolves like Glomgold.",
  "Deep in my bones, I guess I've always feared that one day I'd lose my touch, and the wolves would get the better of me.",
  "And now that day has finally come.",
  "Well, real treasure hunters don't quit searching.",
  "I mean, well, look...",
  "Why is this man upside down, huh?.",
  "Maybe that's a clue.",
  "Wait. Louie, you're right.",
  "They match.",
  "Why else would you use a boat for a map?.",
  "Ahh, hey, I think I see a cave, and it's big enough for...",
  "A ship!.",
  "Follow me.",
  "Gold! Lots of gold!.",
  "Scads of gold!.",
  "Tons of gold!.",
  "Come on!.",
  "Oh, it's empty.",
  "Failure.",
  "Lost the Midas touch.",
  "Aw, poor Uncle Scrooge.",
  "We can't let him give up.",
  "We'll search some more in the morning.",
  "Right. Now let's get some rest.",
  "Anyone got some string?.",
  "- There they are. Sound asleep.",
  "- Good. We've got them now.",
  "And then...",
  "...the gold.",
  "There's Scrooge McDuck.",
  "- But where's the boat?.",
  "- Seсor, I told you, the boat's not here.",
  "How would you know?.",
  "Now just be quiet.",
  "Our Junior Woodchuck alarm!.",
  "Quick, in here.",
  "Robbers, thieves, politicians!.",
  "Come on, boys!.",
  "This way.",
  "That way.",
  "- Scrooge!.",
  "- Glomgold!.",
  "- Los niсos.",
  "- That guy!.",
  "We'll do lunch sometime.",
  "Great.",
  "I'll feed you a knuckle sandwich.",
  "- Ach, where'd he go?.",
  "- Oh, Scroogey!.",
  "Nice try, Mr. Second Best.",
  "We've got to find another exit.",
  "For more than one reason.",
  "The water's rising!.",
  "We're trapped like rats in a goldfish bowl.",
  "Come on, we're not waterlogged yet.",
  "Uncle Scrooge, that prune-faced guy with Glomgold was the guy who tried to steal your model boat back home.",
  "Come on, boys,.",
  "I think we're almost... Oww-ooh!.",
  "Uncle Scrooge!.",
  "Help!.",
  "Hang on, Uncle Scrooge!.",
  "We got ya!.",
  "Ahh, look, the treasure ship!.",
  "There's gold in them there hulls.",
  "Ha-ha-ha-ha!.",
  "I did it, boys.",
  "I'm still number one.",
  "Now let's see our prize.",
  "Bless me kilts, there's at least 3 tons of gold.",
  "I won, Flintheart, you old has-been.",
  "Ha-ha-ha-ha.",
  "But how are we gonna get all this gold home, Uncle Scrooge?.",
  "How? By helping you earn your.",
  "Junior Woodchuck seamanship badges.",
  "Hurry, the monsapis have stopped.",
  "Any minute, all this water's going to drain into the sea.",
  "Almost finished, Uncle Scrooge.",
  "Hah, that Flintheart's probably still running around in those tunnels like a rat in a maze.",
  "All hands on deck!.",
  "- Is the ship seaworthy, men?.",
  "- Aye, aye, Captain Uncle, sir.",
  "- Gold patch, gold ropes...",
  "- And gold sail.",
  "Good lads. Then set sail.",
  "Whoo!.",
  "Look, all the mountains are islands.",
  "No wonder we didn't recognize anything on the map.",
  "It must've been made when the desert was flooded.",
  "Hold her steady, boys, and we'll make it through these rapids.",
  "Oh, no. Uncle Scrooge, look.",
  "We're gonna crash into the rock!.",
  "Hurry, lads.",
  "Get me a cannonball.",
  "Yay! We made it!.",
  "We made it!.",
  "We may need it again.",
  "The people are coming back to Ranguay.",
  "There's the airport.",
  "We're almost out to sea.",
  "I'll have my gold home in no time.",
  "Correction. My gold.",
  "My gold.",
  "My gold!.",
  "Nice of ya to go through all the trouble of fixing this ship and sailing my treasure out.",
  "Ha-ha-ha-ha!.",
  "And just in time.",
  "In another ten minutes,.",
  "I'll have won our bet, too.",
  "Grr...",
  "I found it. My logbook.",
  "20... yards of gold cloth. Check.",
  "18 gold chalices...",
  "Boy, that guy acts like he used to own this ship.",
  "It's been fun, Scroogey, but it's time we parted ways.",
  "One golden helmet. Check.",
  "I'll get even with you, Glomgold.",
  "Now that I'm the richest duck in the world, you're welcome to try.",
  "But I don't want ya to go away empty-handed.",
  "Here. Don't say I'm not a good winner.",
  "Ha-ha-ha-ha.",
  "Hey, my gold!.",
  "You threw away my gold!.",
  "Swim out there and toss it back.",
  "Your usefulness is at an end.",
  "So, you want to play rough.",
  "Unh. Hah!.",
  "Got you, you old wheezer.",
  "No, I've waited too long. Unh.",
  "Give up!.",
  "No, no! The gold.",
  "It is my life.",
  "Uh-oh.",
  "Uncle Scrooge, look.",
  "You idiot. We're over the deepest trench in the ocean.",
  "Not again.",
  "I can't lose my gold again.",
  "We better pick up the survivors.",
  "You'd make a great sailor, Flintheart, on a submarine.",
  "- Uncle Scrooge, where's the old stranger?.",
  "- No sign of him.",
  "He's gone.",
  "Gone to the bottom with his gold.",
  "Gee, I wonder who he was.",
  "Well, it looks like I won the bet, Flintheart.",
  "How? The gold all went to the bottom.",
  "Not all of it.",
  "Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. How do you want it - with or without mustard?.",
  "Yuck!.",
  "I'll get you... so help me,.",
  "I'll get you and my gold."
