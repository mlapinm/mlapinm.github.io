  "bundle of sticks.",
  "once upon a time there lived a farmer on a beautiful farm with his three sons.",
  "the farmer was fairly rich and had everything an ordinary man could want.",
  "but still there was one thing that made his heart ache.",
  "hey aren't you supposed to help out with the stacking.",
  "I already put in the first three bundles.",
  "plus I scrubbed the animals while you were out.",
  "now it's your turn.",
  "hey I was out to get supplies.",
  "so don't give me the I do it all tone.",
  "hey you why aren't you helping.",
  "nice try.",
  "you both can keep fighting while I finish all the work right.",
  "besides I just finished repairing the truck.",
  "mind your tone and you get up and help.",
  "it made the farmer miserable to see his sons arguing all the time.",
  "the boys were Infamous even in the village for this nasty habit of theirs.",
  "hey you know what.",
  "it's been a long time since we all got together.",
  "with the harvest season just around the corner.",
  "there's hardly any time to breathe.",
  "still how about a bonfire by the lake tomorrow evening.",
  "sure sounds wonderful.",
  "but don't call the Osborne boys please.",
  "yes if they come the three of them will keep fighting.",
  "and spoil the evening for all of us.",
  "poor Uncle Osborne.",
  "hey Flint how are you come in.",
  "I was just wondering if you could spare me a hand.",
  "to dig up a patch for peas in my farm.",
  "I was down with the flu.",
  "and I have nobody to help.",
  "you look exhausted.",
  "sure I'll send one of my sons to your farm.",
  "here let's have a cup of tea.",
  "you're lucky you have three of them to help.",
  "ah some luck.",
  "I don't know what to do about my sons.",
  "they just don't get along at all.",
  "Posey don't worry you'll figure it out.",
  "I am so worried.",
  "how will they run the show.",
  "when they fight about every little thing.",
  "in that case just divide your farm into three.",
  "Let each of them be alone.",
  "and maybe then they shall know what a blessing it is to be together.",
  "the words of his friend.",
  "gave the farmer an idea.",
  "hey Manny.",
  "hi how do you get the time to play the banjo with the Harvest around the corner.",
  "ah I forgot.",
  "there's four of you on the farm.",
  "lucky you.",
  "yeah what's up.",
  "all of us are planning to go on a picnic.",
  "and bonfire tomorrow evening.",
  "would you like to join.",
  "I would love to.",
  "come but do not bring your brothers along.",
  "what why.",
  "face it.",
  "if you're together you'll end up fighting.",
  "and none of us other kids want that.",
  "if you want to come you'll have to come alone.",
  "hey getting a cup of coffee.",
  "hi why don't you join.",
  "nah I was just running to the market.",
  "we need a new Spade.",
  "unlike you I don't have brothers to divide the work.",
  "hey by the way.",
  "we're going on a picnic to the lake tomorrow evening.",
  "wow.",
  "if you want to come make sure you come alone.",
  "and not with your brothers.",
  "what why.",
  "because whenever you three are together.",
  "all you do is fight.",
  "and that's very disturbing to all of us.",
  "hey you're really building a mechanical saw.",
  "I like making my own tools.",
  "of course you get time to indulge as you have brothers to share the work.",
  "want to join us for a picnic tomorrow evening by the lake.",
  "sure.",
  "come there the first stroke of Twilight.",
  "but your brothers are not invited.",
  "what why.",
  "because we do not want to spoil our evening by seeing you three fight and face it.",
  "you will fight when you're together.",
  "the three sons of the farmer were pretty shaken by what they had heard.",
  "it was very embarrassing to know what their friends in the village thought of them.",
  "of course none of the brothers shared.",
  "what they had been told to the others.",
  "presently their father called them.",
  "Father you asked us to come.",
  "yes I need to have a serious talk with you.",
  "serious talk.",
  "all three of you are growing up really fast.",
  "soon you will have to take over the farm from me.",
  "but I want to see who among you is the strongest.",
  "he shall be the leader.",
  "why this sudden.",
  "let me finish all three of you are smart and hardworking.",
  "so it's difficult to decide who among you must lead.",
  "hence I have devised a test.",
  "all of you carry these bundles of sticks here.",
  "here they are.",
  "open them.",
  "and now.",
  "I want all of you to break each.",
  "and every stick in the bundle.",
  "let's see who can do it the fastest.",
  "the boys raced against each other to break the sticks.",
  "they could break them easily.",
  "and all three of them finished almost at the same time.",
  "all of you finished together.",
  "almost I guess.",
  "and now outside in the tractor.",
  "there's another set of three bundles bring them in.",
  "the boys did as they were told.",
  "I want you to break them all together without separating the sticks.",
  "the boys tried and tried.",
  "they used all their strength.",
  "but none of them could break the bundle of sticks.",
  "finally exhausted they gave up.",
  "you know why you could not break the bundle.",
  "why.",
  "because when together is one bundle.",
  "the sticks become much stronger as each stick in the bundle supports the other.",
  "so just by being together every stick is protected and automatically taken care of.",
  "imagine if the sticks were to fight and separate out.",
  "why just you a bird a dog could break them.",
  "do you understand what I am saying.",
  "that strength lies in being together.",
  "that to be United is to be safe and protected.",
  "that when we take care of each other all of us benefit.",
  "yes exactly.",
  "now I leave it to you.",
  "you want to be a bundle of sticks or three separate sticks.",
  "and if you decide to be alone.",
  "then just think of Uncle Flint who is all alone.",
  "and has no one to fall back on.",
  "that night the boys thought really hard.",
  "ah I forgot there's four of you on the farm.",
  "lucky you.",
  "whenever you three are together all you do is fight.",
  "of course you get time to indulge as you have brothers to pitch in.",
  "the three boys.",
  "were ashamed of themselves.",
  "the next morning.",
  "you're really good at the mechanical stuff.",
  "helps to have you around.",
  "but I'm not half as good with money and math As You Are.",
  "true and neither of us understands the animals as well as you.",
  "that evening the three sons went out to enjoy coffee together.",
  "they met some of their friends there.",
  "hey aren't you coming.",
  "I am not going anywhere without my brothers.",
  "you guys were right.",
  "we have been pretty nasty.",
  "not just to each other.",
  "but most of all to Dad.",
  "and tonight we shall make amends for it.",
  "so that night they prepared a bonfire.",
  "cooked a Sumptuous meal.",
  "and treated their father to an evening of fun and songs.",
  "finally we are a bundle of sticks.",
  "and my bundle of joy.",

  "what if there is a higher number of crows than the number you just mentioned.",
  "then crows from the neighboring kingdoms must be visiting.",
  "what if the number is fewer than what you mentioned.",
  "then the crows must have gone on a vacation to the neighboring kingdom.",

  "he looked at burbo.",
  "yes even smarter than the infamous burba.",
  "at this the emperor was shocked.",

  "akbar moved in his throne a little for.",
  "he could sense that the man wanted to belittle burple.",
  "but berbal said confidently.",
  "ask me just one difficult question.",
  "all right.",

  "and if you cannot answer correctly.",
  "you will have to accept that i am smarter than you.",
  "sure go ahead.",
  "all right.",

  "we agreed that you will ask only one question.",
  "which you have already done.",
  "oh heavens.",
