  "he followed a track.",
  "and then reached a farmhouse deep in the wood.",
  "some of you go down to the basement.",

  "and detective Ace revealed how he had found out.",
  "first and foremost the spray that the baker gang uses.",
  "to make people unconscious leaves their victims faces bloated in reddish for about three hours after.",
  "but none of the police officers or the ATM guards had bloated her reddish faces.",
  "that created a doubt.",
  "secondly officer I told you that they leave their logo on the crime scene.",
  "because I was doubtful of your police.",
  "I did not tell you that they always leave their logo inside the vaults.",
  "and never on the floor anywhere else.",
  "but in the bank robbery in the van.",
  "the logo was on the floor.",
  "so it was clear.",
  "that the banker gang were not the ones.",
  "who had robbed the bank.",
  "someone was merely using their name to do these crimes.",
  "who would do that and why.",
  "besides we searched this Farmhouse.",
  "while looking for them.",
  "we did not find anyone here.",
  "so how come they're here now.",
  "you did not find them here because they never left the van.",
  "they were hidden inside the van till this Farmhouse was searched.",
  "and once it was established that they were not here.",
  "they were brought and imprisoned here.",
  "the googly Earth view of this site clearly showed tire marks in.",
  "the mud.",
  "who is behind all of this.",
  "the one who wanted to prove.",
  "that the Law and Order situation in Middletown had gone from bad to worse.",
  "so that he could win the elections of the mayor.",
  "how dare you.",
  "do you have any proof of that.",
  "just to answer a few questions.",
  "you and you sir.",
  "I",
  "yes for example.",
  "how is it that your channel and newspaper were the first to reach every crime scene.",
  "how did you know.",
  "I had received a note about every robbery.",
  "I had told no one but Mark about it.",
  "and isn't it true that you and Mr Wisconsin.",
  "have been friends and business associates for more than a year now.",
  "and isn't it true that this Farmhouse belongs to you.",
  "well.",
  "sir isn't it true that you have been a banker yourself before retiring two years back.",
  "every time an ATM runs out of cash.",
  "the machine sends a message to a centralized cash registry.",
  "which in turn connects the company authorized to transport cash.",
  "from the headquarters to the ATN.",
  "and as a head Banker you had access to those cash requests.",
  "when I checked the ATM records.",
  "this particular ATM had run out of cash almost a week earlier than usual.",
  "and that most of those withdrawals had been made by the two of you and several other police officers.",
  "can you explain why.",
  "so what are you seeing exactly.",
  "that the candidate for the mayor wanted to prove.",
  "that the Law and Order in Middletown had gone bad under the current mayor.",
  "so that he could be elected.",
  "he also kept announcing that he would double the salaries of police officers.",
  "if he came to power.",
  "and that is why the police helped him to pull this off.",
  "in order to prove that the Law and Order Machinery of Middletown was failing.",
  "he got police officers to First Stage The Escape of the dreaded gangsters.",
  "who are bank robbers.",
  "and then use their name to Stage a bank robbery.",
  "and loot an ATM cash van.",
  "just two days before elections.",
  "to swing the vote in his favor.",
  "then after coming to power.",
  "he would make.",
  "it look like he improved the police system so much.",
  "that the escaped.",
  "gangsters had been rearrested and the stolen money found.",
  "and now you've ruined it.",
  "as per the rules of Elections you are hereby disqualified for misleading the public.",
  "and you will have to be arrested for stealing public money.",
  "thank you detective Ace for helping Middletown.",
  "I was this close to winning.",
  "I can't believe I've been outwitted by a kid.",
