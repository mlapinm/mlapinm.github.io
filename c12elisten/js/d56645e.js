  "have you known your works location yet.",
  "which district will you work in.",
  "oh yes i believe i will work for a.",
  "company in district 6.",
  "i see i guess it would be more convenient to find apartments in district six.",
  "so it will be easier for you to commute to work.",
  "do you agree with that.",
  "yes i think it's a good idea.",
  "okay another question.",
  "do you plan to live alone or do you want a housemate.",
  "i prefer living alone i need personal space.",
  "oh but i think i will get a pet to live with me in the future.",
  "so a building that allows pets would be nice.",
  "i see do you have any budget for renting an apartment.",
  "i can afford rent at around 250 to 300 dollars.",
  "perfect with that budget you can have a lot of options.",
  "so here are some for you.",
  "first we have the 305 building this building is in the center of district 6.",
  "so the location is really good.",
  "however it's a bit pricey.",
  "the second option is the flower building.",
  "it's more to the west side of the district which is a residential area.",
  "the price is a bit cheaper there.",
  "the final option is the happy building.",
  "this one is the furthest from the center.",
  "and it also has the cheapest rental price.",
  "all of these options are within your budget and they all allow pets too.",
  "what do you think.",
  "i think they are all very nice.",
  "let me see my company is in the center of the city.",
  "but i think i can still commute there by subway.",
  "can i ask a question.",
  "sure.",
  "is the flower building near any subway stations.",
  "yes there is one within walking distance.",
  "that's great how much rent is an apartment in that building.",
  "it's around 230 to 285 dollars depending on the apartment.",
  "why are the prices different.",
  "i thought they would all be the same as.",
  "they're all in the same building.",
  "oh no it's not like that.",
  "the prices will be different depending.",
  "on which floor the apartment is on.",
  "and what kind of apartment it is.",
  "for example a rooftop duplex is a lot.",
  "more expensive than a fifth floor studio room.",
  "ah i see thanks for explaining.",
  "i think a normal studio room is nice enough for me.",
  "i understand.",
  "so the price will be around 230 dollars.",
  "please keep in mind that it will vary as you will later on negotiate with the property owner.",
  "i see so far i like the flower building the most.",
  "it's not too far to where i will work.",
  "and the area seems to not be too crowded.",
  "which is exactly what i like.",
  "i'm glad to hear that.",
  "can i ask a bit more about the flower building.",
  "yes of course what is it that you need to know more about.",
  "i want to know about its location.",
  "you mentioned that there is a subway station nearby right.",
  "what's the name of that station.",
  "it's station five.",
  "this station has a subway line directly to the center of the city so i don't think you need to worry much about commuting.",
  "i see.",
  "are there any supermarkets nearby.",
  "many there are at least two super markets nearby.",
  "one is hello mart and the other is called walmart.",
  "both are super cheap.",
  "there is also an asian market five minute drive from the building.",
  "you don't have to worry about grocery shopping it's a residential area after all.",
  "great it's nice that there is an asian market.",
  "oh by the way is there any gym nearby i hit the gym and work out every day.",
  "oh yeah there is too.",
  "it's near the subway station.",
  "what about entertainment.",
  "are there any karaoke bars nearby.",
  "there are a few bars within driving distance so you don't need to worry about the weekend fun.",
  "there is a mall as well.",
  "i think it's a 20-minute drive.",
  "for karaoke bars let me see.",
  "hmm the nearest one is at least a 30 minute drive away.",
  "i see not too bad.",
  "yes i think this is the best option if you don't want a too loud area.",
  "but there is still sufficient entertainment.",
  "what about the neighborhood.",
  "is it safe.",
  "it's pretty safe.",
  "it's really clean as well.",
  "i think the people who live there have.",
  "clean up for the street once a week together i think.",
  "i see what's about the building.",
  "is there anything to worry about my neighbors.",
  "no not at all.",
  "most of the people living in the building are young families.",
  "you might hear some baby crying at midnight but that's that.",
  "the neighbors are super nice and friendly.",
  "i think there are some events for the building's citizens once a month as well.",
  "you can expect some buildings picnic or special christmas party.",
  "that sounds lovely what about the crime rate here.",
  "it's really low you don't need to worry.",
  "about the burglary or such things.",
  "but just lock the doors whenever you go out just to make sure.",
  "i understand.",
  "then i guess there is nothing to worry about.",
  "especially safety problems if i live here right.",
  "you are absolutely right.",
  "then i think i would like to visit the building sometime.",
  "who should i contact.",
  "i'll give you the contact to the building's owner mrs smith you can call her.",
  "thank you very much.",
  "you are welcome.",
  "hello is this mrs smith the owner of the flower building.",

  "you are welcome see you next thursday.",
  "thank you see you.",
  "thank you for last thursday mrs smith.",
  "you are welcome it was a pleasure to meet you.",
  "so what do you think.",
  "i like the apartment on the second floor.",
  "much is the rent for that one.",
  "it will be two hundred and forty dollars per month.",
  "and i will help you furnish the house with basic necessities with a plus of a hundred dollars for the first month.",
  "hundred dollars that's quite a lot.",
  "hmm what will you furnish for me.",
  "i will install for you an ac with a heating function.",
  "you will also have a stove a fridge in a bed prepared for you.",
  "all you have to do is to move here and unpack your things.",
  "i see if so then it's not a bad price i think.",
  "but i don't think i need a bed prepared for me.",
  "i want to decorate the apartment myself.",
  "if i don't need the bed then how much is left.",
  "well then the extra fee for the first month will be 75 only.",
  "so for the first month it will be three hundred and fifteen dollars and then it will be two hundred and forty dollars for each next month.",
  "i see can i get a discount if i sign a long term contract like a five-year one.",
  "i think i really like this area as well as the apartment.",
  "the location is also really good so i would like to stay for quite a while.",
  "hmm let me think.",
  "in that case i can give you a discount of ten dollars per month.",
  "i also don't use the parking lot can you give me a discount on that.",
  "oh yeah sure the parking fee is five dollars included in the rent.",
  "if you don't use the parking lot it will be deducted.",
  "however if you decide to have a car and you want to use the parking lot.",
  "please tell me so i will cancel the discount.",
  "i understand thank you for the clarification.",
  "so to sum it up my rent will be two.",
  "hundred and twenty five dollars for each month.",
  "and the first month will be 300 right.",
  "i will also have a stove a fridge and anac ready for me.",
  "you are absolutely correct do you agree with the rent.",
  "it's a very pleasant price i agree with it.",
  "how should i make a payment.",
  "you can pay it on the first day of every month.",
  "however if you want to prepay or if you want to pay in a lump sum.",
  "just tell me i'm very flexible with payment.",
  "i see thank you for explaining.",
  "so i think you have chosen the flower building as your next day.",
  "when do you want to make a contract.",
  "is the upcoming wednesday okay with you.",
  "yes i will be here all day on wednesday.",
  "just give me a call before you come in.",
