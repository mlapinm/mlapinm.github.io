  "p02 SPEAK ENGLISH FLUENTLY.",
  "Hey in today's lesson, I'm going to teach you how to finally think and speak in English.",
  "I'm going to explain the connection, give you a simple formula that will help you.",
  "Finally start speaking like a native English speaker.",
  "Are you ready?.",
  "Well, then I am teacher.",
  "Tiffani let's jump right in.",
  "All right.",
  "So the first thing you have to understand is the five Ws method.",
  "That's right.",
  "We must first start off by thinking in English, using the five W's who, what, when, where and why?.",
  "So let's say we're talking about our daily life and we're going to start with our morning routine.",
  "Look at this man, he's working out hard, but we want to describe what he's doing.",
  "Like a native English speaker.",
  "So we must think in English, who is he?.",
  "His name is Mike he's 50 years old.",
  "What is Mike doing?.",
  "Mike is working out hard when at 6:00 AM every morning.",
  "Where at a large gym, not too far from his house.",
  "And why?.",
  "He learned the importance of discipline from working on a farm and the importance of staying in shape from his military background.",
  "So again, what have we done?.",
  "We have thought in English, we saw what was happening.",
  "This man was building muscles and he does it every morning.",
  "This is his morning routine and we use the five W's.",
  "So now how do we speak in English?.",
  "His morning routine.",
  "So once again, we have the five W's here, organized.",
  "Who, what, when, where and why?.",
  "Which will lead us to speaking about his morning routine.",
  "Watch this read along with me.",
  "I am 50 years old, but I still work out hard at 6:00 AM every morning.",
  "I usually exercise at a large gym, not too far from my house.",
  "People always say my consistency is impressive.",
  "Honestly, I learned the importance of discipline from working on a farm and the importance of staying in shape from my time in the military.",
  "You see what just happened?.",
  "Right.",
  "Using the five W's we thought about his morning routine, and then we were able to.",
  "Think, and then speak.",
  "Now I want to break down some of the words, some of the vocabulary words within this speaking portion, but I want to remind you to use the five W's to talk about your own morning routine.",
  "Now I see a word in here that maybe you don't know.",
  "The first word is consistency.",
  "Good after me again, consistency.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Now the word consistency just means the quality of always behaving or performing in a similar way or of always happening in a similar way.",
  "So let me explain something to you really quickly about this.",
  "Remember who I am your english teacher.",
  "Right.",
  "So every Sunday I make it a point to upload an English lesson Sundays at 8:00 AM Eastern.",
  "Right.",
  "So I want to do it on a regular basis.",
  "My behavior, my pattern is uploading English lessons for you on Sundays.",
  "So I am trying to practice consistency.",
  "Makes sense.",
  "Right?.",
  "You got it.",
  "Now, maybe you have a little bit of trouble with the pronunciation.",
  "I want to remind you to download the English with Tiffani app within the app.",
  "There are many lessons and courses, but I have a specific course on pronunciation that will help you so you can download that course.",
  "Uh, you can download the app.",
  "All right.",
  "So consistency.",
  "Now let's go back again and look at what was.",
  "The next word was impressive.",
  "Impressive.",
  "So after me, impressive.",
  "Excellent again.",
  "Impressive.",
  "Good job.",
  "Now this word impressive is also very important.",
  "If an object or achievement is impressive, you admire or respect it usually because it is special, important, or very large.",
  "So for example, me, when I think about you as a student, as an English learner, Learning a second language or a third language.",
  "And for many of you, a fourth language, English is not your mother tongue.",
  "I am impressed.",
  "Your abilities are impressive.",
  "Why you are learning another language.",
  "You are so intelligent.",
  "So that's an achievement.",
  "You are very impressive.",
  "Makes sense.",
  "Right.",
  "So again, we said that Mike's morning routine.",
  "Is impressive.",
  "All right.",
  "Now there's another one that I want us to look at very quickly.",
  "The other one was discipline.",
  "Again, discipline.",
  "Excellent.",
  "All right.",
  "Now what does the word discipline actually mean?.",
  "It's the ability to.",
  "To control yourself or other people, even in difficult situations.",
  "So maybe your favorite dessert is ice cream.",
  "When you see the ice cream, you want to eat it all, but you're on a diet you're trying to lose weight.",
  "So you have.",
  "Be disciplined.",
  "You have to control yourself from eating all of the ice cream.",
  "It makes sense.",
  "Right?.",
  "In English we say, discipline, are you a very disciplined person?.",
  "Let us know in the comment section.",
  "All right.",
  "So we have discipline.",
  "Now, once again, looking at what was said to describe his morning routine, we have all of the information and we're able to speak about his morning routine because we.",
  "Thought about his morning routine using the five W's who, what, when, where and why now, before we move to the afternoon routine, I want you in the comment section to write about your personal morning routine.",
  "Now, remember again, using the thought section, thinking in English, you must first again, say.",
  "What when, where and why?.",
  "So let us know about your morning routine in the comment section.",
  "All right, here we go.",
  "Let's move on to the afternoon routine again.",
  "You're going to notice this pattern.",
  "Think, speak, think, speak, think using the five W's and then you'll be able to speak fluently in English.",
  "Here we go.",
  "Afternoon routine.",
  "Let's look at this afternoon routine, maybe you're at work and you have to have lots of meetings with your coworkers.",
  "So who my team members and I, we are web designers.",
  "What go to a team meeting in the afternoon when around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, where in the big conference room, down the hall from my office.",
  "Why to discuss how we will create all of the images, layouts, and videos for a new corporate website.",
  "So once again, what did we do?.",
  "We thought about the afternoon routine?.",
  "Who, what, when, where and why we're organizing our thoughts about this period of time, you can do it for any situation.",
  "Now we've thought about it again, we have the five W's very clearly broken down for the afternoon routine.",
  "So how would we now speak about the afternoon routine here?.",
  "This is how we would say all of that information.",
  "I am a web designer and I work with a great team.",
  "Got it.",
  "Almost every day.",
  "We have a team meeting at around 2:00 PM in the afternoon.",
  "Got it.",
  "When our team meetings are in the big conference room, down the hall from my office, got it.",
  "Where we meet to discuss how we will create all of the images, layouts, and videos for a new corporate website.",
  "Got it.",
  "I explained why.",
  "So, because we thought about our afternoon routine five W's we were able to speak fluently in English about our afternoon routines again, think and speak simple formula, use the five W's and bow you'll start sounding like a native English speaker.",
  "Now within our answer, there were about three things that I want to explain to you.",
  "So here we go.",
  "I want to explain the first one, the first one is at around, let me take this off the screen very quickly at around.",
  "Now this means near or close to approximately, and it usually refers to a numerical value or point in time.",
  "So for example, let's say you're going to have a party going to have a party?.",
  "All right.",
  "So you're going to have a party, right?.",
  "And you say, Hey guys, my party starts at 3:00 PM.",
  "Everyone's like, okay, I'll be there.",
  "But then one of your friends says, oh my goodness, I have to work that day.",
  "And I get off at 3:00 PM, but I'll rush there.",
  "And I think I can get there at around 3 45.",
  "It means approximately I'm going to try to get there at that time in English we use at around.",
  "So again, look at how we used it in this situation.",
  "We said we have a team meeting at around 2:00 PM.",
  "Meaning approximately makes sense.",
  "Right.",
  "Okay.",
  "Now what about down the hall from, I said down the hall from now, this is also something we use on a regular basis.",
  "So down the hall from means it specifies a location along the hall.",
  "Like if you're in a building.",
  "There's a hallway.",
  "So down the hall from means you're talking about a certain place along the hallway, it means further along the hall from a specific location I'm in this spot, but it's further down from me.",
  "It's down the hall from.dot dot.",
  "So my office is down the hall from my boss' office.",
  "The bathroom is down the hall.",
  "The conference room, you see what's happening, right?.",
  "You're telling where something is in relation to something else in English.",
  "We say down the hall from, so in this example, speaking about his afternoon routine, her afternoon routine, we said our meetings are in the big conference room, down the hall from my office.",
  "Makes sense.",
  "Right.",
  "Okay.",
  "Now there was one more that I wanted to explain it.",
  "Corporate corporate.",
  "Now again, after me for pronunciation corporate.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Now we saw how we use this.",
  "We said the last sentence.",
  "We meet to discuss how we will create all of the images, layouts, and videos for a new corporate website.",
  "All right.",
  "So what does corporate mean?.",
  "Corporate actually means relating to a large company.",
  "So think about apple.",
  "I love apple computers.",
  "I love apple products.",
  "Apple is a huge.",
  "Now the main office could be referred to as the corporate office or the headquarters.",
  "So corporate just refers to a large company.",
  "So when we explained the afternoon routine, we said they meet to discuss what they're going to do for the large company website or the corporate website makes sense.",
  "Right.",
  "So now we understand corporate.",
  "We were able to speak about the afternoon routine, like a native English speaker, very fluently simply because we first thought about it in English.",
  "One more time.",
  "Who, what, when, where and why all of these pieces of information were included in our response, when we spoke about the afternoon routine.",
  "So what about the evening routine?.",
  "All right.",
  "So here we go.",
  "Evening routine may be you enjoy hanging out with your friends.",
  "So we have to start with again the who, my closest friends and I they're my elementary school friends.",
  "What we go out to eat when every Thursday at 7:00 PM, where popular restaurants in our area.",
  "Why we are all foodies and we enjoy spending time with each other after work.",
  "Now I want to pause really quickly and emphasize something again.",
  "This phase, this step, this stage is very simple.",
  "It doesn't matter what level you are in English.",
  "You can think of who you are with what you did very simply.",
  "Where you were, why?.",
  "And when, again, the thinking portion is simple, breaking it down, using the five W's right now, we have everything that you do in the evening with your friends, having a great time.",
  "Now we need to speak in English about your evening routine.",
  "So here we go.",
  "Evening routine using all of the information we gathered from the five Ws.",
  "My closest friends and I have known each other since elementary school.",
  "Usually we try to hang out every Thursday at 7:00 PM.",
  "We go out to eat at popular restaurants in our area because we are all foodies, but more importantly, we truly enjoy spending time with each other after work.",
  "Now, you know how natural that sounded.",
  "But look, I just use the five W's and you can do the same thing to sound like a native English speaker.",
  "Now, there are a few words and expressions that I'd like to go over with you.",
  "The first one is hang out after me.",
  "Hang out.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Now let me explain what hangout actually means.",
  "Here we go.",
  "It means to spend time relaxing or socializing informally.",
  "Or to spend a lot of time in a place or with someone, Hey, spend time with your friends at a restaurant.",
  "I used to enjoy cooking for my friends.",
  "When I lived in South Korea, I loved it and I would invite them over and we would hang out, spend time together.",
  "So in the comment section, I want you to tell us where do you like to hang out?.",
  "Do you like to hang out at the mall at your friend's house?.",
  "Maybe you like to go to a cafe.",
  "Where do you like to hang out?.",
  "Let us know in the chat section.",
  "All right.",
  "So we say, hang out in English.",
  "So again, looking at it, what do we see?.",
  "We, my closest friends and I usually try to hang out every Thursday at 7:00 PM.",
  "Now I want us to look at the next one.",
  "Go out to eat.",
  "You may have heard this one, or you may not.",
  "This just means again, to eat at a restaurant or a way from one's home.",
  "So I mentioned earlier that I love cooking, but some times it's nice to go to a restaurant to let somebody else cook for me to let somebody else cook for myself and my friends.",
  "So we go out, we're not inside.",
  "We go out.",
  "Let us know in the chat section, where do you like to go out to eat maybe in your country?.",
  "There are some amazing restaurants.",
  "Where do you like to go out to eat?.",
  "I love going to Indian restaurants, as you all know.",
  "I love Indian food and Mexican food as well.",
  "So we say, go out to eat in English.",
  "And again, we saw, we said, go out to eat at popular restaurants.",
  "Now the last one I want to explain is a popular.",
  "Foodie, you got it F sound front teeth, bottom lip after me Foodie.",
  "Excellent.",
  "All right.",
  "Now let me explain what a foodie is.",
  "A foodie is a person with a particular interest in food or a person who loves a food and is very interested in different types of food.",
  "Yes.",
  "I consider myself to be a foodie.",
  "I love so many different types of food.",
  "I love Indian.",
  "I love Haitian.",
  "I love Mexican.",
  "I love Mediterranean because the food is delicious.",
  "So I consider myself to be a foodie because I'm so interested in food.",
  "Maybe you're a foodie as well.",
  "All right.",
  "So we say foodie in English, and we explained that my friends and I are food.",
  "Makes sense.",
  "Right.",
  "Okay.",
  "So again, what we did was we were able to explain, talk about, speak English fluently about my or your, or their evening routine simply simply because we first thought about it in English.",
  "What, when, where and why.",
  "And then we were able to give the response, like a native English speaker.",
  "Now, honestly, I hope you enjoyed this lesson.",
  "I hope you learned a lot and I hope you put this into practice.",
  "You can do it.",
  "I want to encourage you.",
  "All you have to do is think in English like a native English speaker using the five W's and then you'll be able to speak like a native English speaker.",
  "Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help you and to teach you and guide you along your way.",
  "Don't forget to download the English with Tiffani app.",
  "You'll find more courses on pronunciation and many other things to help you along your English journey.",
  "Click the link right in the description.",
  "All right, I'll see you next week, but as always remember to speak English.",
  "You still there.",
  "I know you are and you know what time it is.",
  "Come on and join me.",
  "It's story time.",
  "Hey, I said it's story time.",
  "All right.",
  "Today's story is about.",
  "Food.",
  "That's right.",
  "I explained earlier in the lesson that I am a foodie, I love food.",
  "And I have a friend who is also a foodie and we actually became close friends because.",
  "So, let me explain what happened.",
  "So I had been in Korea for about eight years and I came home just for a short break and I was going to go back to South Korea to finish my last year and a half there.",
  "Now, when I was going back, I was told by the office, like the head office that they were going to place me at a new school, a school I had never been to.",
  "So I was a bit apprehensive because I didn't know anyone there.",
  "All of my roots, my Korean family members lived in Seoul for those that know about soul.",
  "It's the major city in Korea.",
  "And they wanted to move me to the outskirts of the city, look up the word outskirts on the outside, kind of like the suburbs, but a very quiet area.",
  "And I said, you know what?.",
  "It's okay.",
  "I prayed about it.",
  "And I decided to go.",
  "So when I got there, there were only, I think, three or four other Korean teachers and I think two or three other foreign teachers like Americans or native English speakers.",
  "It was a very small school.",
  "I left the school that had 10 and another school that had 20.",
  "So this was a very small school.",
  "And in the school among the Korean teachers, there was one teacher and I'll say her name, Anny.",
  "She may watch this video.",
  "Her name was Anny and she seems really nice.",
  "She seemed very organized and she also seemed to be a very good teacher just from observing her.",
  "When I first got there, I was like, okay.",
  "Yeah, sure.",
  "She seems...basically about business.",
  "And I am a person that is about business.",
  "I take my job seriously and she seemed to be that type of person as well.",
  "So anyways, Anny approached me one day and said, Tiffani, you know, would you mind teaching me the Bible?.",
  "Now we had known each other for maybe a month.",
  "We weren't close, but we saw each other every day at work.",
  "And she recognized that I enjoy teaching the Bible to my students.",
  "So I said, sure, No, no worries.",
  "She knew I spoke Korean and she also spoke English well, but she said, Hey, I think it will be nice to study the Bible with you in English.",
  "And if I have questions, I can ask you in Korean.",
  "I said, \"Sure, no problem.",
  "So we started studying the Bible.",
  "We had a great time.",
  "She loves God.",
  "I love God.",
  "And we had great conversations.",
  "So we had been studying with each other for maybe about two or three weeks.",
  "And again, I noticed that she was a very hard worker.",
  "I admired her work ethic, but that was the extent we didn't do anything after work.",
  "We just saw each other at work, very cordial, very nice to each other.",
  "So one day, Anny approached me when we were in the staff room and said, Hey, Tiffani, do you want to go out to eat for lunch?.",
  "And I was like, okay, sure.",
  "You know, I was new to the area.",
  "Again, I'm a foodie, but she and I had never talked about food.",
  "She said, you want to go out to lunch?.",
  "I said, sure.",
  "She said, yeah, there's an Indian restaurant.",
  "Not too far from here.",
  "Now remember I told you my favorite food is Indian.",
  "So inside I said, yeah, but outside, I said, oh, that sounds nice now Anny knows me very well now.",
  "So my responses are a lot.",
  "But, you know, I didn't know her that well.",
  "And I said, oh, okay.",
  "You know, that's nice.",
  "Let's go.",
  "I was excited.",
  "So anyways, the next day we decided, and we went to the restaurant.",
  "So we get to the restaurant.",
  "And again, we're just talking great conversation.",
  "It was really easy to talk to her.",
  "We had great conversation and we talked about life, you know, my experiences, her experiences, and then the food came.",
  "Now when the food came, remember I am a foodie.",
  "I love Indian food.",
  "So I know what Indian food is good.",
  "And what Indian food is not good.",
  "So the plates arrived and like there was the steam coming up from the Curry.",
  "And then I saw the naan and I was getting excited because my nose was happy.",
  "I could smell that the seasonings, they were correct.",
  "Right.",
  "So, but again, I was still talking to Anny and we were just talking.",
  "So the food, came, you know, we prayed over the food.",
  "We, you know, kind of like wiped her hands off.",
  "And I took a piece of the naan and I dipped it into the Curry.",
  "And when I put it to my mouth, I said it was y'all.",
  "It was good.",
  "And I was kind of enjoying it.",
  "And in that moment I heard Anny do the same thing.",
  "MMMM, this food is good.",
  "Now again, a lot of the conversation was happening in Korean because we switched over and we were at the restaurant.",
  "So I looked up and I said, this food is good.",
  "Isn't it?.",
  "She said, wow.",
  "Yes, this food is good.",
  "And I realized, oh my goodness, she's a foodie.",
  "Needless to say fast forward.",
  "Wow.",
  "Has it been four years, four years.",
  "And she's one of my closest friends.",
  "We enjoyed that meal and she realized how much I love food.",
  "And we just talked about, oh my goodness, the seasoning, the non is good.",
  "The Curry is good.",
  "This is good.",
  "And we realized how much we loved food.",
  "So the next week we went out to lunch again, and the following week we went out to lunch again, and we kept going to different restaurants.",
  "We would make plans to go and travel.",
  "We would go 45 minutes in the middle of the day to go get some delicious food and rushed back to work for the afternoon.",
  "We loved food and we bonded over food.",
  "Of course, our love for God as well.",
  "But she became one of my closest friends and we are still close to this day.",
  "All because we found out that we both were foodies.",
  "Now, again, guys, you all know how much I enjoy food.",
  "I want to know, are you a foodie?.",
  "If you are, what's your favorite food?.",
  "Put it in the comments section.",
  "And if you're watching, I can't wait till this pandemic is over so we can.",
  "Some more good food Anny you can come on and visit me in America.",
  "All right, guys.",
  "Thank you so much for joining.",
  "I hope you enjoyed today's lesson.",
  "Remember to think and speak in English.",
  "I'll talk to you next week.",
  "I love you and don't forget to speak English."
