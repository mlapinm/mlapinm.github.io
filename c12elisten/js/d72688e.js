  "Intro.",
  "in this video we're going to cover balance.",
  "balancing on one foot.",
  "and transferring our weight.",
  "and we're going to start without skates.",
  "this is great for small spaces as well.",
  "before you put.",
  "your skates on.",
  "Balance Without Skates.",
  "just stand on one foot.",
  "feel how your foot's making constant little tiny adjustments.",
  "to keep you balanced.",
  "and i'm going to use my upper body as well.",
  "which we're going to do with skating.",
  "so just notice that feeling of adjusting.",
  "because that's what you're going to need.",
  "when you get your skates on.",
  "first thing we're going to do.",
  "is just.",
  "standing still and we're just going to lift one foot.",
  "Use Something To Lean On.",
  "oh better have something to lean on i think don't you.",
  "could i have a chair please.",
  "there you go.",
  "thank you.",
  "so all you're going to do is hold on.",
  "and balance on one foot.",
  "Stand On One Foot.",
  "and just feel the balance.",
  "i actually think it's easier to balance in skates.",
  "than it is in shoes.",
  "but that's just me once you've got your balance you can let go.",
  "so if you're doing this on carpet.",
  "it's going to be a lot easier.",
  "because your wheels won't roll.",
  "but if you're indoors on some sort of laminate or wooden floor.",
  "you might get a little bit of roll which you'll have to control.",
  "so the reason i'm showing you this is.",
  "Why? The Penguin!.",
  "because when you start to skate.",
  "what often happens is you get the penguin move.",
  "and that's because you can't balance.",
  "to get more weight on one foot than the other.",
  "so once you're confident.",
  "that you've got your balance standing.",
  "let's get you moving as a new skater.",
  "Moving.",
  "i don't expect you to put your skates on.",
  "and balance on one foot while rolling immediately.",
  "because that's just terrifying.",
  "so what we're going to do.",
  "is we're just going to roll on two feet.",
  "so you can do your bubbles and then you can roll.",
  "and all i want you to do.",
  "is just feel that you've got more weight on one foot than the other.",
  "you haven't even gotta lift your foot at this point.",
  "so do a bubble and then just lean your way all the way onto one foot.",
  "and all the way onto the other foot.",
  "How To Transfer Weight.",
  "when i say to you.",
  "change your weight the easiest way to think of it.",
  "is you're going to put the knee over your toe.",
  "and that will transfer the weight from one side to the other.",
  "so you just do that when you're skating.",
  "transfer.",
  "knee over toe.",
  "all i'm doing is transformer.",
  "i'm not lifting my feet yet.",
  "that will come in time.",
  "Don't Have Weight Central.",
  "so the penguin comes from your weight being central.",
  "you cannot skate with your weight central.",
  "you have to shift the weight from one foot to the other.",
  "so by doing this.",
  "you're shifting your weight.",
  "so the more confident you get.",
  "you'll be able to lift your feet.",
  "and that will get you skating.",
  "so i'm telling you to do this.",
  "Take The Foot Back.",
  "i shift shift shift.",
  "as you get better you'll be able to lift the foot.",
  "don't lift this foot here.",
  "because it's still going to pull your weight central.",
  "so when you lift the foot.",
  "you need to take it back.",
  "so my feet together shift.",
  "back.",
  "together shift.",
  "back.",
  "if you don't take this back and keep it close to the other foot.",
  "it's going to pull you off.",
  "so i'm just going to show you a progression.",
  "Drill Progression.",
  "so you're going to do a bubble.",
  "and then you're going to just lean over on one side.",
  "and then the other.",
  "and this is just how you're going to practice.",
  "so i'm feeling a bit more confident now.",
  "so this time i'm going to do a bubble.",
  "this time i'm going to get all my weight on here.",
  "and i'm going to lift this foot.",
  "and you can do another bubble.",
  "and get all your weight on the other one.",
  "and lift that one.",
  "so you can take it really slowly.",
  "just at your own pace.",
  "so you're really comfortable and confident.",
  "when you're doing it.",
  "this drill will really really help you in your skating.",
  "and it will lead to stroke skating.",
  "which we've done a video on this is such a.",
  "core fundamental being able to shift your weight.",
  "it's so important so keep practicing.",
  "it's going to be frustrating.",
  "i'm sorry but please try really really hard.",
  "and take it at your own pace.",
  "and you will get there.",
  "and you will notice a huge difference once you get it.",
  "i'm katie.",
  "Bye Bye.",
  "you've been watching skatey.",
  "and i'll see you next time.",
  "bye.",
  "Outtakes.",
  "before you put your skates on.",
  "i you're going to be like did you say the floor.",
  "did you say the floor.",
  "oh my central.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_WCm_VvLY0&list=PLPHb4PtMjk0shrC0nwgRMvWwEDESn8KHc\">oh my central</a>",
  "Intro.",
  "and with the arrival of winter for most of us.",
  "Drill Progression.",
  "it's meant that we've had to come inside to practice.",
  "and i know rink time is quite a premium.",
  "but it doesn't mean you have to stop practicing.",
  "because even if you've got a little area in your house.",
  "we can still do some small space practice.",
  "which will help you gain control of your skates.",
  "and get your balance for when you can skate again.",
  "and then you'll be even more fabulous.",
  "than you were before.",
  "Slide Shuffle.",
  "so our first small space skill is going to be.",
  "like a little slide shuffle.",
  "so if you stand hip width apart.",
  "have your arms out or you can hold on to something.",
  "and all you're going to do is slide one foot forward.",
  "and one foot back.",
  "and then bring them back and the opposite way.",
  "so to stop your legs from going too far apart.",
  "you have to keep a tension in your legs.",
  "and to bring them back together.",
  "you've got to squeeze your thighs together and then relax.",
  "let the tension stop them from going too far.",
  "and then to bring them back.",
  "you just squeeze the thighs back together again.",
  "so tension so don't go too far and squeeze.",
  "so this one can be done moving.",
  "and this is great.",
  "because it gets you used to the position of a stagger.",
  "and it's also great for a cruise.",
  "because you do the same position.",
  "when you're cruising.",
  "so this is a great one to get control of.",
  "you can do it nice and fast.",
  "when you get better.",
  "and you can do it to music to the beat the music.",
  "make it a bit more fun.",
  "for safety on this one.",
  "is it's important to keep your feet hip width apart.",
  "because you can kick your other foot.",
  "and kick them out from underneath you.",
  "so just be careful with that.",
  "they're not.",
  "too close.",
  "Slide Forward.",
  "so the next one is going to be a little slide forwards.",
  "so this is great for getting the feel of the weight transfer.",
  "i'm going to slide my left foot forward.",
  "so to be able to do that.",
  "i had to put all my weight on my back leg.",
  "bend the knee and you can feel the release of this leg.",
  "and then you can slide it forwards.",
  "then come back to center weight on both feet.",
  "slide the weight to the other foot.",
  "and then you can release.",
  "like this and then what's really nice.",
  "is you can do slide slide.",
  "so you can get like a little routine going.",
  "Side Step.",
  "the next one is a little side step.",
  "now this looks incredibly easy.",
  "but don't be fooled.",
  "if you don't put your foot down completely flat.",
  "and you put a little bit more weight on the front or the back.",
  "the skate will start to roll.",
  "so be careful.",
  "do the slow leaf at first.",
  "and bend your knees.",
  "this is going to help you get so much control.",
  "because you're going to keep your weight dead over your skate.",
  "it will make a big big difference if you can get this.",
  "like a little crab step.",
  "once you've got control of this side stepping.",
  "and your wheels aren't rolling.",
  "Cross-In-Place / TikTok Strut.",
  "you can try doing a cross in place.",
  "nice bent knees hold on if you need to.",
  "and what you're going to do.",
  "is cross the foot over.",
  "so what you're doing is.",
  "as you put this foot down.",
  "the weight transfers onto this foot.",
  "lifts off of this one and this one goes back.",
  "because what you don't want to do.",
  "is kind of have both feet on the floor together like this.",
  "it's almost like a swap of feet.",
  "so i'm swapping my feet.",
  "and they're not really doing that.",
  "i'm swapping with this little cross one.",
  "i think there was a tick tock video a while ago.",
  "they're called this the strut.",
  "tick top strut.",
  "so it's quite fun you can get it going really really fast.",
  "but one thing to be very careful of.",
  "is that you keep your foot flat.",
  "because anyone who's seen my instagram.",
  "will see me doing this.",
  "and i put my foot down like that.",
  "it ended badly.",
  "so keep your foot flat and you can get like a little jump.",
  "and put a little bit of energy into it.",
  "all of these skills will really really help you to get balance.",
  "and control of your skates.",
  "because i'm sorry.",
  "i do make them look quite easy.",
  "but when you start trying them as a beginner.",
  "they're actually quite tricky.",
  "so do be careful hold on to stuff.",
  "and if you're in your house be careful.",
  "because obviously you're going to have tables and chairs and things.",
  "you can bang yourself on.",
  "so it's still a good idea even though you're indoors.",
  "to keep yourself safe.",
  "so when you do get to skate outdoors again.",
  "or you get some time at the rink.",
  "a lot of these skills you can do moving as well.",
  "so i'm going to quickly show you the moving too.",
  "Bye Bye.",
  "a great way to drill these ones is to put on some music.",
  "and just enjoy yourself.",
  "i'm katie you've been watching skatey.",
  "and i'll see you next time.",
  "bye.",
  "Outtakes.",

  "Intro.",
  "have you just bought roller skates.",
  "or perhaps you want to learn to roller skate stick around.",
  "and i'm going to show you the nine important things you need.",
  "to know to get you started.",
  "Tip 1 - Check New Skates.",
  "when you take your skates out the box you need to check a couple of things.",
  "the most important thing is to check that your wheels roll.",
  "so if they don't roll.",
  "you need to loosen the nut.",
  "and if they move like this up and down the axle.",
  "then you need to tighten the nut.",
  "you'll need your spanner that fits.",
  "the next thing to check is your toe stop.",
  "Tip 2 - Toe Stops.",
  "there are three main types.",
  "this one is a bolt-on toe stop.",
  "so it cannot be adjusted.",
  "it will just wear down over time.",
  "and you'll need to replace it.",
  "you can get bigger and smaller ones of these.",
  "but you cannot adjust it up and down.",
  "this type of toe stop is the one.",
  "that you will find on lots of the more popular skates.",
  "this is on the moxie skate.",
  "so the chances are you probably have one of these types of toe stops.",
  "now this nut.",
  "these are known for coming undone.",
  "so once you think the nuts tight.",
  "all your body weight and tighten it as hard as you can.",
  "because the last thing you want to do.",
  "is to go for a toe stop that's not there.",
  "doesn't end well.",
  "if you're going to put a toe guard on here.",
  "make sure the toe guard goes between the toe stop.",
  "and the nut not between the plate and the nut.",
  "that's really important.",
  "and the last.",
  "type of toe stop is like mine.",
  "where you.",
  "have to put an allen key in there and.",
  "these can be adjusted in height.",
  "you can.",
  "also adjust these in height as well one.",
  "of the biggest questions that gets asked.",
  "Tip 3 - Wheels.",
  "all the time is what wheels do i need.",
  "if you've just bought roller skates the.",
  "chances are.",
  "you'll be fine to roll on.",
  "the wheels that you've got.",
  "but if you go.",
  "outside it might feel a bit rattly or if.",
  "you go into a ring.",
  "it might feel a little bit like your skating is really hard.",
  "and that's when you need to change.",
  "so outside you want nice big squidgy.",
  "wheels.",
  "so big wheels are around 62 millimeters.",
  "and what makes them squidgy is the softness.",
  "so around a 78 to an 85 would be an outdoor wheel.",
  "when you come inside you're looking at around a 90 wheel.",
  "now this is still a big wheel.",
  "around a 62 mil.",
  "62 will give you lots of speed.",
  "but it's not as maneuverable as.",
  "the smaller wheels.",
  "so this is a 90 wheel.",
  "so what i like to skate on are really.",
  "hard wheels.",
  "because these are great for.",
  "spinning and turning because they slide.",
  "on top of the surface of the rink.",
  "but when you're a beginner these can feel like you're ice skating.",
  "just get your feet before you start.",
  "thinking about going to a really hard wheel.",
  "so this is a 57mm wheel.",
  "which is great for turns and spinning.",
  "and it's.",
  "also really really hard at 101a.",
  "Tip 4 - Known Issues.",
  "some entry level skates have known issues.",
  "so as a safety precaution.",
  "i will always recommend checking your skates.",
  "before you skate every time.",
  "one really good thing to do is to give your skate a shake.",
  "if you can hear a metallic rattle it means something is loose.",
  "it could be that a wheel is.",
  "sliding up and down the axle.",
  "it could.",
  "mean that the toe stop is loose.",
  "could mean that something on the kingpin is wobbly.",
  "so make sure your trucks aren't wobbly.",
  "or too loose.",
  "now another known issue.",
  "is that the upper can separate from this heel.",
  "so just check and make sure give it a tug.",
  "make sure nothing's coming apart.",
  "because the last thing you want is for your skate to fail whilst you're skating.",
  "Tip 5 - Safety Gear.",
  "you may notice.",
  "i have some accessories on.",
  "you always need to wear these accessories.",
  "when you're skating to keep you safe.",
  "as a beginner and as an advanced skater.",
  "i can guarantee you.",
  "it only takes a couple of heavy falls outside.",
  "for you to realize.",
  "how important this all is.",
  "so you need a double certified helmet.",
  "the s1 helmets are incredibly good.",
  "you need wrist guards with metal on both sides.",
  "and you need elbow pads.",
  "that are going to stay in the right place.",
  "and knee pads the bigger the better.",
  "what you'll find is if you straighten up in these big knee pads.",
  "they're going to dig into your legs.",
  "but if you bend they won't.",
  "which is fantastic.",
  "because this bent knee is what you want for skating.",
  "Tip 6 - Where To Put Your Weight.",
  "perfect.",
  "so your safety gear's on and your skates are on your feet.",
  "so the most important thing i need to tell you now.",
  "is where to put your weight.",
  "so when you're skating.",
  "you want the weight over the front truck.",
  "which is where the two front wheels are.",
  "basically that will be around the ball of your foot.",
  "so if you think of putting the weight on the ball of your foot.",
  "90 of the time that's where it needs to be unless you're doing tricks.",
  "and things.",
  "but when you're a beginner.",
  "always wait on the ball of your foot.",
  "whether you're going forwards or backwards.",
  "that's really important.",
  "Tip 7 - Posture.",
  "so let's do it let's skate weight on the ball of my feet.",
  "now i'm going to bend my knees.",
  "and you can't bend your knees too much.",
  "because the more your knees are bent.",
  "the closer you are to the ground.",
  "so should you fall.",
  "it's gonna hurt less because you're lower.",
  "so bend your knees as low as you can.",
  "if you think you've bent your knees guarantee.",
  "you could probably bend them a bit more.",
  "okay so you can either do bubbles.",
  "or you can do marching.",
  "and i've got videos on both of these.",
  "but i'm going to do bubbles.",
  "you need to learn to skate forwards first.",
  "arms out now all my weight is forwards.",
  "it's fine to be a little bit too far forwards at first.",
  "because a forward fall is much nicer than the backwards full.",
  "so i'm gonna do my bubbles with my knees really really bent.",
  "a quick tip with the knee bend is.",
  "if you look down and you can see your foot.",
  "your knees not bent enough.",
  "your knees should be over your toe.",
  "Tip 8 - Fear Of Falling.",
  "one of the things.",
  "that i find puts beginners off a lot of the time.",
  "is the fear of falling.",
  "which is completely understandable.",
  "so your safety gear is going to help it.",
  "puts the barrier between you and the floor.",
  "which is fantastic.",
  "but if you feel the wobble.",
  "if you've got a nice knee bend.",
  "you feel a wobble the best thing to do.",
  "is to forget the skill.",
  "you're trying to practice.",
  "your only thing to concentrate on now.",
  "is controlling your fall.",
  "so what you need to do.",
  "is to get into a cannonball.",
  "as quickly as you can.",
  "because this will one.",
  "save the full or two.",
  "if you fall from here.",
  "it's nowhere near as bad as.",
  "if you're falling from standing up.",
  "another thing you can do if you feel the wobble.",
  "is you can use these.",
  "these are great.",
  "so i'm skating along and i'm like.",
  "oh i'm wobbling.",
  "drop to a knee.",
  "that works really well as well.",
  "to practice this position.",
  "you can do this without your skates on.",
  "to just get the motion of getting down onto one knee.",
  "Tip 9 - Skill Progression.",
  "so the next thing to talk about is skill progression.",
  "so i know that everybody.",
  "just wants to be able to skate now.",
  "but i consider there is a safe way of learning.",
  "so the most important thing obviously is to learn forwards.",
  "and then once you're skating forward you need to learn to stop.",
  "and i've got a video on three ways to stop.",
  "which i shall link for you.",
  "and then from there.",
  "i think the next progression is backwards.",
  "and from here the next thing is to learn to turn from forwards to backwards.",
  "so a c turn is really good for that.",
  "lots of people go from forwards to then transitioning.",
  "but i kind of think you need to learn back for skating first.",
  "because you learnt to skate forwards.",
  "then you've learned to turn.",
  "and all of a sudden you're backwards.",
  "and you've never done it before.",
  "which is pretty terrifying.",
  "so it's really important for me.",
  "i think to do forwards stopping backwards.",
  "and then transitions.",
  "and from there practice practice practice.",
  "and get those fundamentals.",
  "and then you can start learning tricks.",
  "and all sorts of fun stuff.",
  "Bye Bye.",
  "so this video has given you a really brief overview.",
  "of the nine important things.",
  "you need to know to learn to roller skate.",
  "but i've got so many videos.",
  "with lots and lots more detail.",
  "on each of the things.",
  "we've spoken about.",
  "so at the very end of this video.",
  "i will link to the beginner playlist.",
  "which has got all of those in.",
  "i'm katie you've been.",
  "watching skatey.",
  "and i'll see you next time.",
  "bye.",
  "Outtakes."
