  "Hi Tofu, should we go play?.",
  "Hi!.",
  "Ummm….",
  "actually my friends are waiting for me.",
  "Hey guys.",
  "Hi Tia!.",
  "Anyone wants to hear a story?.",
  "Yes, yes!.",
  "Okay.",
  "Once upon a time.",
  "there was a really beautiful peacock.",
  "And he knew that he was beautiful.",
  "Look at my tail.",
  "has anyone ever had such a beautiful tail.",
  "My feathers are so gorgeous.",
  "All the animals disliked it when the peacock behaved like that.",
  "But he didn’t care.",
  "One day, he came across a crane.",
  "Hello crane.",
  "Hello.",
  "Have you see my feathers and tail.",
  "aren’t they beautiful?.",
  "Yes, it is.",
  "I agree.",
  "its the best.",
  "Unlike your pale tail.",
  "So colourless and boring.",
  "I on the other hand.",
  "look like a king.",
  "Yes, that may be so.",
  "But Can your lovely feathers help you to fly?.",
  "Like I can.",
  "high in the sky?.",
  "Amongst the clouds and the stars?.",
  "High enough to see the beauty of the earth?.",
  "I think not.",
  "you just stay here.",
  "close to the ground.",
  "like an ordinary cock.",
  "The peacock had nothing to say to the crane.",
  "He no longer felt as proud of his feathers as he used to.",
  "and he realised that there was more to life than just looking beautiful.",
  "Ummm…that’s a great story Tia.",
  "And I realise I must go apologise to someone.",
  "I thought you might feel that way after hearing this story.",
  "Well, please excuse me for a moment."
