  "let me explain it to you with the story i know.",
  "the princess and the pea.",
  "once upon a time.",
  "a young prince wanted to get married.",
  "so he went around the world looking for the right princess to marry.",
  "alas he found none.",
  "something or the other was always amiss in all the princesses he met to be a true princess to his people.",
  "one stormy night after the prince came back home.",
  "he and his family were having their dinner.",
  "when there was a commotion outside the castle door.",
  "the queen went to see what was going on.",

  "and they dragged my carriage into slush and mud.",
  "my men are still with the carriage trying to repair it.",
  "i have walked many miles to reach here.",
  "nobody who looked at the young girl could believe that she could ever be a princess.",
  "she didn't look anything like a princess.",
  "with her hair disheveled and clothes and shoes full of mud.",

  "the prince had been informed about the stranger at the door.",
  "and the queen's decision.",
  "mother do you really believe that she is a princess.",
  "her appearance betrays her but her eyes shine with courage.",
  "and there is humility and grace in her behavior just like that of a princess.",
  "however we must wait till tomorrow morning to know whether she is really a princess or not.",
  "saying so the queen retired from the dinner table.",
  "and went up to the room that was being prepared for the princess.",
  "your highness the princess is in the bath.",
  "we are preparing the bed for her.",
  "very well fetch me 20 of the softest mattresses that the castle has to offer.",
  "yes your highness.",
  "once the maids had left.",
  "the queen took out a beef from her pocket.",
  "and placed it right in the middle of the princess's bed.",
  "when the maids returned with the mattresses she ordered them to place them on the top of the pea.",
  "that night the princess slept on her special bed.",

  "my bed was really soft.",
  "but something kept poking me in the back.",
  "and i had bruises all over.",
  "the queen smiled happily because she knew.",
  "that the girl in front of her was a true princess.",
  "only a real princess who has lived all her life in comfort can feel a small pee kept 20 mattresses below her.",
  "and only a kind princess would not mention her discomfort unless asked to do so.",
  "son she is the one you have been looking for.",
  "soon the prince was married to the princess of his dreams.",
  "and they happily lived in the kingdom.",
  "where all the people loved and respected them both a lot.",
  "wow tia no matter where the princess would have gone.",
  "people would have always recognized her because of her behavior.",
  "exactly tofu and the same thing applies to your friend sam.",
  "if he's a good person.",
  "soon people will be able to see that in him.",
  "and if he's not people will be able to see that also.",
  "yes you are right tia.",
  "i don't think i have to worry about him anymore.",
  "i am sure everyone will see his truth soon."
