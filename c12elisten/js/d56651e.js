  "and tried to negotiate with him.",
  "but unfortunately he told me that he couldn't reduce the price to seven hundred ten thousand dollars.",
  "oh.",
  "he could only lower the price from 740 000 to 730 000.",
  "would that work for you.",
  "that'd still be difficult for me.",

  "he will reduce the price to 720 000 with the condition that you'll have to pay your own money.",
  "if you want to redecorate or make any changes to the house.",
  "that should be no problem.",
  "we're fine with that condition.",
