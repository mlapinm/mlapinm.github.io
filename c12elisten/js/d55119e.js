  "BASIC: What You Offer the World.",
  "This is the Basic version of the reading.",
  "If you would like a challenge, you can skip to the Advanced version by clicking on the next reading.",
  "By Richard N Bolles.",
  "Richard N Bolles is an expert on life planning.",
  "He wrote \"What Color Is Your Parachute?\" The book offers helpful information on how to figure out the skills you have.",
  "These skills will lead you to the job you want.",
  "What you offer the world.",
  "For years, I’ve taught workshops attended by people from around the world – poor, rich, young, old, schooled, and unschooled.",
  "I’ve discovered that everyone – and I mean everyone – has at least 500 skills.",
  "The questions are: Which kind, and what are they?.",
  "We are all born gifted; we are all born \"skilled,\" even people with serious disabilities.",
  "Watch a baby learn, eat food and put information to use.",
  "The skills every child has are astounding!.",
  "Your skills are the gifts you offer the world.",
  "Basically there are three kinds of skills.",
  "It is useful to divide them into three types: verbs, nouns and adjectives.",
  "Functional Skills: The Things You Do.",
  "Some of your skills are verbs, things you do.",
  "Some examples are sewing, driving, communicating, motivating, organizing, planning, memorizing and researching.",
  "These are your \"transferable skills\" They are also called gifts and \"natural skills\".",
  "They are strengths you have, often from birth.",
  "Some people, for example, are born knowing how to negotiate.",
  "Negotiating means speaking with people or groups who don't agree on an answer to a problem.",
  "Sometimes you can learn these skills.",
  "So some of these skills are \"acquired,\" or learned.",
  "They are called transferable skills because they can be transferred from one job to another.",
  "They can be used in many different types of fields.",
  "Acquired Skills: Your Expertise.",
  "Some of your skills are nouns, like people, subjects and objects.",
  "Some examples are computers, English, flowers, colors, Microsoft Word, music and Japanese.",
  "These are called your \"subject skills\" or \"knowledge skills\" Subjects are fields that you study, like technology or English, and information.",
  "Subject skills are what you know about and what you are interested in.",
  "They are often called \"your expertise,\" or what you are an expert in.",
  "You have learned these, over the years, through school, life experience, books or from a teacher.",
  "Which ones do you really love to use?.",
  "This is the second set of skills you have to offer the world.",
  "Personal Trait Skills.",
  "Adjectives or adverbs are the third kind of skills.",
  "Some examples of these adjectives are words like dependable, responsible, thoughtful and kind.",
  "These are your \"trait skills\" Traits are the ways you handle yourself and interact with the world.",
  "These are developed mostly through experience.",
  "When we talk to people, we speak of our traits as though they are just who we are: \"I am dependable; I am imaginative; I am on time\" But actually, traits are always linked to your transferable skills, as adjectives or adverbs.",
  "For example, your favorite transferable skill might be \"researching\" That is, when you discover facts about something by investigating it closely.",
  "Your trait skill would give more information about how you do your \"researching\" Do you do it carefully and orderly, or creatively?.",
  "These traits are the third thing you have to offer to the world.",
  "One Of A Kind.",
  "How you put these three kinds of skills together is what makes you one of a kind.",
  "It is important to figure out what kinds of jobs need the transferable skills, subject skills and traits you most like to use.",
  "After all, you were born because the world needs what you uniquely have to offer."
