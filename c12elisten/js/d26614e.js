  "once upon a time there was a young king named derrick.",
  "who ruled a prosperous kingdom called rockholm.",
  "one time when he traveled around the kingdom derek met a very beautiful girl.",
  "he had never seen such a clever and attractive girl before.",
  "he immediately fell in love with the girl at first sight and thought that she was the love of his life.",
  "derek didn't let her know he's the king.",
  "as he wanted the girl to love him for who he was not because of his wealth or power.",
  "however the girl did not love him she was a hearty person.",
  "so when she saw derek with an ordinary appearance she looked down on him.",
  "she just wanted to take advantage of derek's love and then left him.",
  "the young king was deeply hurt.",
  "he lost his faith in life and true love.",
  "when he returned to the palace derrick had completely changed and turned into a different person.",
  "the young king started to drink and party all day and night to drown his sorrow.",
  "the good officials in the palace felt very worried they tried to find a way to dissuade the king.",
  "your majesty i think you should not keep drinking and partying all day and night.",
  "only then can you care about the people in the kingdom better.",
  "care care you only care about my throne get out of my sight.",
  "your majesty you're very clever.",
  "yes those people were too rude they dare to go against your will.",
  "hearing those flattering words the king continued to immerse himself in drinking and parties.",
  "gradually the king neglected his mission.",
  "and no longer cared about his works and his people in the kingdom.",
  "the bustling capital gradually became dull.",
  "one day after a big party derek and his officials went hanging out in the forest.",
  "then the king saw a young couple cutting wood together.",
  "it was felix and amelia a poor but happy couple.",
  "you two go ask them to come and meet me.",
  "felix and amelia came in front of the king.",
  "you're good cutters in this village.",

  "we are cutting woods here.",
  "i saw that you guys work very hard.",
  "is this a well-paid job.",
  "did you save any money.",
  "your majesty my wife and i are not rich but we have enough to live and some savings as well.",
  "oh so the money you saved what did you use it for.",
  "your majesty it is divided into four parts.",
  "one part is to pay for our debt one i buried in the ground.",
  "one part i threw to the devil and the last one i sent to an angel.",
  "oh well well that's so mysterious.",
  "please explain these four things in your own way of thinking.",
  "ah but wait no one is allowed to hear this except for me.",
  "everyone had to step back as they weren't allowed to hear felix explanation including amelia.",
  "all right oh god you can explain it to me.",
  "your majesty the first part is from my debt meaning the money i give my parents who gave birth to me and raised me.",
  "that's good you are such a filial son.",
  "the part i bury in the ground is one i will use to help the poor.",
  "if you plant something you see it grow it means the happiness you get when you help others.",
  "great you are a kind guy.",
  "the part i throw to the devil that's the money i spend on drinking and partying.",
  "and the one i sent to the angel means i give my wife.",
  "i like the first two things but not the other two.",
  "you seem to trust your wife but there's no such thing called real love in this world.",
  "and drinking and partying can help people forget about the suffering and boredom so they are great right.",
  "your majesty my wife is the one i trust the most.",
  "for me alcohol and parties only make people become worse.",
  "you are an idiot.",
  "you will find what you think is dead wrong.",
  "okay you can go now but keep these four things secret do not tell anyone else including your wife.",
  "if you tell anyone i will put you in prison for life.",
  "felix didn't need to think much he agreed to follow the king's order.",
  "when derek returned to the palace he wrote down the four things that felix said.",
  "after that derek ordered to spread the news throughout the kingdom that if anyone could solve all four riddles they would be rewarded with lots of jewels.",
  "i'm sure that felix's wife will try her best to get the answers from her husband.",

  "a lot of curious people tried to solve them but couldn't.",
  "even in the peaceful countryside where felix and amelia were living.",
  "the people around the village knew about the king's riddles.",
  "they discussed them a lot.",
  "one day a friend of felix named jose came to invite him to go out to drink and talk.",

  "and what are those.",
  "i couldn't say it i have made a promise with the king.",
  "if i tell anyone i will be imprisoned for life.",
  "only two of us are here do you think i would tell others.",
  "after a bit of hesitation felix decided to tell the secret to jose which was the answers to the four riddles of the king.",
  "however because of the temptation to be rewarded jose did not care about his friendship with felix anymore.",
  "he remembered all four things.",
  "the next day jose went to the palace and asked to solve the four riddles.",
  "your majesty i have the answers to four mysterious riddles.",
  "he told felix answers to the king and of course they were all correct.",
  "interesting your answers were all right.",
  "i will reward you as promised.",
  "but how could you understand those things.",
  "your majesty a friend of mine told me that.",
  "your friend who's he.",
  "your majesty my friend's name is felix.",
  "felix huh.",
  "oh the king immediately ordered the guards to arrest felix and send him to jail.",
  "felix was very confused and didn't understand what was going on knowing felix had been arrested by the king.",
  "amelia felt so worried she decided to go all the way to the palace and asked to see the king.",
  "you are felix's wife why did you come.",
  "here do you want to solve those four riddles.",
  "your majesty i have no idea.",
  "my husband kept his promise and never told me anything.",
  "i came to ask you why did you arrest felix my husband.",

  "a man named jose came here and sold all four riddles.",
  "he said it's you who told him about those.",
  "as you broke your promise you will be imprisoned for life.",
  "do you have any more excuses.",
  "felix just remembered and told the king that jose had invited him to drink and ask him about the answers.",
  "your majesty actually that day i only told him the answers because i was drunk.",
  "i didn't expect that jose.",
  "it is clear that you broke your promise with me.",
  "god come and put felix behind bars for life.",
  "your majesty let me say some last words.",
  "i accidentally told jose the answers because at that time i was drunk and couldn't control myself.",
  "your majesty you remember the third thing i said that drinking is throwing money to the devil.",

  "and my wife who loves and trusts me unconditionally had to go a long way to come here.",
  "do you remember the fourth thing i said my wife was an angel.",
  "that is because of our true love.",
  "true love it still exists.",
  "i have proved that the last two things i said were true.",
  "previously your majesty didn't agree with those two so now what do you think of them.",
  "actually he was right.",
  "so i was wrong all along.",
  "now i believe what you said was true.",
  "your family will receive a worthy reward.",
  "thank you your majesty.",
  "and jose guards come put that greedy jose in prison.",
  "your majesty it was my fault that i didn't know how to choose a real friend and i trusted him too much.",
  "please forgive him your majesty.",
  "derek admired felix's kindness so the king gave him and his wife lots of jews and gold.",
  "since then they became rich and lived happily for their whole life.",
  "and the king also regained his belief in life and gave up their drinking and parties.",
  "derek's kingdom gradually recovered and the people there also lived in prosperity and peace."
