  "this story happened in a beautiful house.",
  "there lived a cute boy named george he had lots of toys in his rooms.",
  "and the 25 tin soldiers that he had just received from his mothers were his favorite toys.",
  "out of 25 tin soldiers there was a unique one named roger due to the lack of tin during production.",
  "he had solely one leg.",
  "george this soldier must have been a defect product i will exchange it for you.",
  "it's not a problem mom this soldier is.",
  "so strong and resilient he can even stand still with only one leg.",
  "i will make him the commander of his team.",
  "george's mother smiled proudly when hearing these words from her son.",
  "everything kept going peacefully in the morning.",
  "but until midnight the room turned out to be a different world.",
  "when the toys started to move and interact with each other.",
  "in this room there lived a beautiful dancer doll named diana.",
  "she was the doll that george's father made by himself as a gift for his son on christmas day.",
  "diana was placed on the most solemn corner in the shelf.",
  "that's also the reason why she was hated by many other toys they always teased.",
  "roger was really impressed by her because she was so cute.",
  "and mostly because she was a ballet dancer so she also stood on one leg.",
  "how beautiful diana is and she's even like me.",
  "we both can stand still by only one leg.",
  "one time when the tin soldier intended to come closer to talk to diana.",
  "he saw that she was being bullied by other toys.",
  "hey diana how dare you stand there.",
  "that's my position.",
  "that's right stay away from there.",
  "seeing that the tin soldier started to fight against these toys to protect diana.",
  "from that moment no one dared to bully diana anymore.",
  "you better watch out boy.",
  "thank you brave soldier i really don't know what to do without your help.",
  "that's my honor lady.",
  "from that day the tin soldier and the dog became close friends.",
  "they sat down together every night.",
  "talked about what they had experienced in their life.",
  "and time went by they gradually fell in love with each other.",
  "but things never kept on going peacefully like that.",
  "the tin soldiers had many enemies after protecting the ballet dancer.",
  "until one day when he had not paid attention he was cornered by these toys.",
  "he stepped back and fell out of the window.",
  "when george got back to his room he could see the tin soldier nowhere.",
  "he searched everywhere in the room.",
  "but he could find nothing.",
  "he was really desperate.",
  "mom where's my brave tin soldier i can't see him anywhere.",
  "a gardener found the tin soldier on the grass in the garden.",
  "his head was damaged after falling down.",
  "making the gardener believe that he was a broken toy.",
  "the gardener looked at him for a while.",
  "it must be a broken toy that the master threw out.",
  "thinking so he threw the little tin soldier to the stream.",
  "he fell onto a leaf which was floating on the stream.",
  "on the leaf he had to try his best for not falling off.",
  "but kept on drifting until it came near to the top of a waterfall.",
  "roger was so frightened that he jumped out of the leaf and swam upstream.",
  "while swimming he was swallowed by a fish.",
  "then the fish was caught by a fisherman.",
  "the fish was sold in the market.",
  "and by accident there was no one else but george's mother who bought this fish.",
  "george told his mother many times about the brave tin soldier that he had lost.",
  "when she saw the soldier was in the stomach of the fish.",
  "she happily brought it back to the toys room of george.",
  "everything in the room was so familiar with the little soldier.",
  "and like he thought he was sent back to that room.",
  "he was even placed beside the beautiful dancer.",
  "the ballet dancer was also really happy.",
  "she felt her tears begin to form.",
  "is that you my brave tin soldier.",
  "what magic brought you back here.",
  "i thought that i would never be able to see you again.",
  "yes it's me diana really nice to meet you again.",
  "after that george recalled and told diana about his dangerous journey.",
  "they happily talked to each other.",
  "but that was not the end of the story.",
  "because they had been placed on the shelf which was near to the window.",
  "george's mother forgot to close it.",
  "suddenly a wind blew over making roger and diana fly toward the burning stove.",
  "as they were about to fall into the stove.",
  "roger decided to sacrifice.",
  "he had no choice but to use his body to block the way.",
  "and push the beautiful doll out then he flew towards a burning flame.",
  "fortunately roger just fell into the edge of the plane.",
  "and it was luckier that george and his mother had come back to the room in time.",
  "george was brought out of the fire.",
  "but the flame had damaged his right arm.",
  "mom why didn't my brave soldier fall into the stove.",
  "it looks like he had even saved this doll.",
  "i'm not sure darling maybe the tin soldier and the doll were blown out by the wind.",
  "george was so sad.",
  "but he still said.",
  "anyway my brave tin soldier is back.",
  "i will place him in the safest place for not putting him in trouble again.",
  "the little kid placed roger and the beautiful doll in the most magnificent position in the displaying showcase.",
  "from that moment roger and diana lived together happily forever after."
