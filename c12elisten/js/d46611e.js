  "All about databases.",
  "Hello again.",
  "So far, you've seen how data can be gathered and analyzed to solve all kinds of problems.",
  "Next step, we're going to learn all about databases.",
  "As a refresher, a database is a collection of data stored in a computer system, but storage is just the beginning.",
  "You'll discover how databases make it possible to find the exact piece of information you need for your analysis.",
  "You'll also learn how to sort data in order to zoom in on what you need to generate insightful reports and much more.",
  "Then we'll go even deeper, and I mean really, really deep.",
  "I'm talking about metadata.",
  "You've probably heard someone say, wow that's so meta.",
  "Usually they're talking about something referencing back to itself or being completely self aware.",
  "For example if a character in a book knows she's in a book, that's meta.",
  "If you make a documentary about making documentaries, that's also meta.",
  "And here at Google, I constantly analyze how I analyze data.",
  "That's definitely meta.",
  "I do that to give my work a quality check to make sure my methods are fair.",
  "And to be certain that I'm paying attention to any biases that might affect the outcome.",
  "As an analyst, you should do this too.",
  "Sometimes we get a little too close to our data.",
  "So stepping back and asking ourselves if our processes make sense is key.",
  "But let's back up just a bit and define metadata.",
  "Metadata is data about data.",
  "Like I said: deep.",
  "Metadata is extremely important when working with databases.",
  "Think of it like a reference guide.",
  "Without the guide all you have is a bunch of data with no context explaining what it means.",
  "Metadata tells you where the data comes from, when and how it was created, and what it's all about.",
  "Up next, you'll learn how to take data from a database or another source and bring it into a spreadsheet.",
  "You'll do this either by importing it directly or by using SQL to generate the request.",
  "And once you have data in a spreadsheet, the possibilities are endless.",
  "Everything we're about to cover is a very important part of the prepare phase of the data analysis process.",
  "It's how data analysts figure out which kind of data is going to be most helpful to them.",
  "If you have the right data, you're much more likely to be able to solve your business problems successfully.",
  "So, ready to tap into the incredible power of databases?.",
  "Let's go!.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-preparation/lecture/JCWIr/database-features\">Let's go!</a>",
  "Database features.",
  "Databases are essential tools for data analysts.",
  "I use them constantly.",
  "Just about all of the data I access is stored within databases.",
  "Databases store and organize data, making it much easier for data analysts to manage and access information.",
  "They help us get insights faster, make data-driven decisions, and solve problems.",
  "You've already heard a bit about what databases are and how they're used by data analysts.",
  "Now let's learn more about database features and components.",
  "Here's a simple database structure.",
  "It contains tables with information from a car manufacturer.",
  "The top level includes car dealerships, product details, and repair parts.",
  "Then if you drill down to the next level by selecting one of those tables, you'll find more specific details about each item.",
  "This is called a relational database.",
  "A relational database is a database that contains a series of related tables that can be connected via their relationships.",
  "For two tables to have a relationship, one or more of the same fields must exist inside both tables.",
  "For example, here, branch ID exists in this table and this one.",
  "If a field exists within both tables, we can use it to connect the tables together.",
  "The branch ID field is the key to connecting these tables.",
  "There are two types of keys.",
  "A primary key is an identifier that references a column in which each value is unique.",
  "You can think of it as a unique identifier for each row in a table.",
  "For our dealership table with information about the different dealership branches, branch ID is the primary key.",
  "Similarly, for the product details table about each car, VIN is our primary key.",
  "As an analyst you may need to create tables.",
  "If you do decide to include a primary key, it should be unique, meaning no two rows can have the same primary key.",
  "Also, it cannot be null or blank.",
  "There are also foreign keys.",
  "A foreign key is a field within a table that's a primary key in another table.",
  "In other words, a foreign key is how one table can be connected to another.",
  "Because our repair parts table contains information about each car part, the primary key is part ID.",
  "Each row in our repair parts table represents one unique part.",
  "All the other keys in this table, such as the VIN, are the foreign keys that allow the repair parts table to be connected to the other tables.",
  "As you can see, a table can only have one primary key but it can have multiple foreign keys.",
  "Understanding primary and foreign keys can be tricky, so you'll have more opportunities to practice coming up.",
  "But as a general summary, a primary key is used to ensure data in a specific column is unique.",
  "It uniquely identifies a record in a relational database table.",
  "Only one primary key is allowed in a table and they cannot contain null or blank values.",
  "And a foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between the data and two tables.",
  "It refers to the field in a table that's the primary key of another table.",
  "Lastly, it's important to note that more than one foreign key is allowed to exist in a table.",
  "Feel free to rewatch this video to be sure you understand primary and foreign keys clearly.",
  "And coming up, you'll begin practicing how to access and analyze data from actual databases.",
  "That will be a great opportunity to improve your understanding of primary and foreign keys, database organization and how you might use databases in your future analytics career.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-preparation/lecture/vsFl7/exploring-metadata\">That will be a great opportunity to improve your understanding of primary and foreign keys, database organization and how you might use databases in your future analytics career.</a>",
  "Exploring metadata.",
  "Now that you understand the different ways to organize data in a database, let's talk about how you can describe that data.",
  "In this video, we'll start exploring metadata, which is a very important aspect of database management.",
  "Metadata is an abstract concept, though.",
  "Let's kick things off with a simple, everyday example.",
  "Did you know that every time a photo is taken with a smartphone, data is automatically collected and stored within that photo?.",
  "Take a look.",
  "Choose any photo on your computer.",
  "Here's a cute shot of my friend's dogs, Rudy and Matilda.",
  "On your photo, right-click on \"Get Info\" or \"Properties.\" This will give you the photo's metadata, which may tell you the type of file it is; the date and time it was taken; the geolocation, or where it was taken; what kind of device was used to take the photo; and much more.",
  "Pretty amazing, right?.",
  "Here's another example.",
  "Every time you send or receive an email, metadata is sent right along with that message.",
  "You can find it by clicking on \"Show Original\" or \"View Message Details.\" An email message's metadata includes its subject, who it's from, who it's to, and the date and time it was sent.",
  "The metadata even knows how quickly it was delivered after the sender pressed, \"Send.\" Metadata is information that's used to describe the data that's contained in something, like a photo or an email.",
  "Keep in mind that metadata is not the data itself.",
  "Instead, it's data about the data.",
  "In data analytics, metadata helps data analysts interpret the contents of the data within a database.",
  "That's why metadata is so important when working with databases.",
  "It tells an analyst what the data is all about.",
  "That makes it possible to put the data to work solving problems and making data-driven decisions.",
  "As a data analyst, there are three common types of metadata that you'll come across: descriptive, structural, and administrative.",
  "Descriptive metadata is metadata that describes a piece of data and can be used to identify it at a later point in time.",
  "For instance, the descriptive metadata of a book in a library would include the code you see on its spine, known as a unique International Standard Book Number, also called the ISBN.",
  "It would also include the book's author and title.",
  "Next is structural metadata, which is metadata that indicates how a piece of data is organized and whether it's part of one or more than one data collection.",
  "Let's head back to the library.",
  "An example of structural data would be how the pages of a book are put together to create different chapters.",
  "It's important to note that structural metadata also keeps track of the relationship between two things.",
  "For example, it can show us that the digital document of a book manuscript was actually the original version of a now printed book.",
  "Finally, we have administrative metadata.",
  "Administrative metadata is metadata that indicates the technical source of a digital asset.",
  "When we looked at the metadata inside the photo, that was administrative metadata.",
  "It shows you the type of file it was, the date and time it was taken, and much more.",
  "Here's one final thought to help you understand metadata.",
  "If you're on your way to the library to pick out a book, you could research a book's title, author, length, and number of chapters.",
  "That's all metadata, and it can tell you a lot about the book, but you have to actually read the book to know what it's all about.",
  "Likewise, you can read about data analytics, but you have to take this course to earn the Google Data Analytics certificate.",
  "Keep moving forward to gain that new perspective.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-preparation/lecture/7utuH/using-metadata-as-an-analyst\">Keep moving forward to gain that new perspective.</a>",
  "Using metadata as an analyst.",
  "Now that you know what metadata is, it's time to explore why data analysts use it.",
  "You already know that data needs to be identified and described before it can help you solve a problem or make an effective business decision.",
  "Putting data into context is probably the most valuable thing that metadata does, but there are still many more benefits of using metadata.",
  "Here's one.",
  "Metadata creates a single source of truth by keeping things consistent and uniform.",
  "We data analysts love consistency.",
  "We always aim for this kind of uniformity in our data and our databases.",
  "After all, data that's uniform can be organized, classified, stored, accessed, and used effectively.",
  "Plus, when a database is consistent, it's so much easier to discover relationships between the data inside it and the data elsewhere.",
  "Metadata also makes data more reliable by making sure it's accurate, precise, relevant, and timely.",
  "This also makes it easier for data analysts to identify the root causes of any problems that might pop up.",
  "The bottom line is, when the data we work with is high quality, it makes things easier and improves our results.",
  "One of the ways data analysts make sure their data is consistent and reliable is by using something called a metadata repository.",
  "A metadata repository is a database specifically created to store metadata.",
  "Metadata repositories can be stored in a physical location, or they can be virtual, like data that exists in the cloud.",
  "These repositories describe where metadata came from, keep it in an accessible form so it can be used quickly and easily, and keep it in a common structure for everyone who may need to use it.",
  "Metadata repositories make it easier and faster to bring together multiple sources for data analysis.",
  "They do this by describing the state and location of the metadata, the structure of the tables inside, and how data flows through the repository.",
  "They even keep track of who accesses the metadata and when.",
  "Here's a real-world example.",
  "As a health care analyst at Google, I use second and third party data.",
  "As you learned, second party data is data that's collected by a group directly from its audience and then sold.",
  "Third party data comes from outside sources, which are not the original collectors of that data.",
  "They get it from websites or programs that pull the data from the various platforms where it was originally generated.",
  "It's a bit complex, but the main thing to remember is that third party data doesn't come from inside your own business.",
  "If my team needs to work with data that wasn't created at Google, that means we sometimes don't know very much about its quality and credibility, but we need to be certain that our data can be trusted and was collected responsibly.",
  "After all, if the data is unreliable, our results can be unreliable too.",
  "That's why understanding the metadata of the external database is so important.",
  "It lets us confirm that the data is clean, accurate, relevant, and timely.",
  "This is particularly important if the data comes from another organization.",
  "One other important step when working with external data is confirming that we're allowed to use it.",
  "We'll often reach out to the owner to make sure we can access or purchase it.",
  "To sum up, metadata repositories are useful for all these reasons.",
  "Plus, they help ensure that my team is pulling the right content for the particular project and using it appropriately.",
  "We can confirm this because the metadata clearly describes how and when the data was collected, how it's organized, and much more.",
  "Soon you'll learn even more about using metadata in data analytics, and if you're finding metadata particularly fascinating, you'll discover some really exciting career choices that focus on metadata.",
  "Stay tuned.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-preparation/lecture/C7QQB/metadata-management\">Stay tuned.</a>",
  "Metadata management.",
  "Metadata and metadata repositories are very powerful tools in the data analyst toolbox.",
  "As we discussed previously, data analysts use them to create a single source of truth, keep data consistent and uniform, and ensure that the data we work with is accurate, precise, relevant, and timely.",
  "These tools also make it easier to access and use data by standardizing our processes.",
  "In this video, we'll explore more components of metadata and learn how metadata analysts work to keep things organized.",
  "We know that the amount of data out there continues to grow, but lots of businesses just aren't using their data.",
  "Sometimes, they don't know what they have, sometimes they can't find it or sometimes a business just doesn't trust it.",
  "Especially in bigger companies, data can span numerous different processes and systems.",
  "And pulling together data from so many places can be a big challenge.",
  "For example, let's say a company starts out with a traditional data storage system in its offices.",
  "But then, as the amount of data it owns continues to expand, cloud storage is needed too.",
  "Plus, this company could also be accessing and using second or third party data from a partner organization.",
  "Each of these systems has its own rules and requirements, so each organizes the data in a completely different way, adding even more complexity.",
  "It's no wonder so many organizations struggle to find the right data at the right moment.",
  "On the other hand, metadata is stored in a single, central location and it gives the company standardized information about all of its data.",
  "This is done in two ways.",
  "First, metadata includes information about where each system is located and where the data sets are located within those systems.",
  "Second, the metadata describes how all of the data is connected between the various systems.",
  "Another important aspect of metadata is something called data governance.",
  "Data governance is a process to ensure the formal management of a company’s data assets.",
  "This gives an organization better control of their data and helps a company manage issues related to data security and privacy, integrity, usability, and internal and external data flows.",
  "It's important to note that data governance is about more than just standardizing terminology and procedures.",
  "It's about the roles and responsibilities of the people who work with the metadata every day.",
  "These are metadata specialists, and they organize and maintain company data, ensuring that it's of the highest possible quality.",
  "These people create basic metadata identification and discovery information, describe the way different data sets work together, and explain the many different types of data resources.",
  "Metadata specialists also create very important standards that everyone follows and the models used to organize the data.",
  "There's one thing they all have in common.",
  "Whether they work at a tech company, a nonprofit association, or a financial institution, metadata analysts are great team players.",
  "They're passionate about making data accessible by sharing with colleagues and other stakeholders.",
  "If you're looking for a role that encourages you to explore all the data that the digital world has to offer, following the path to becoming a metadata analyst may be the right choice for you.",
  "But either way, businesses of all kinds face market trends and competition, and they need to understand why one process works while another doesn't.",
  "Data analytics allows them to answer key questions and keep improving.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-preparation/lecture/bHqPA/megan-fun-with-metadata\">Data analytics allows them to answer key questions and keep improving.</a>",
  "Megan: Fun with metadata.",
  "My name is Megan, and I am an agency measurement lead here at Google.",
  "Basically, I help to demystify measurement and analytics for advertising agencies.",
  "So people that are tasked with executing media plans for advertisers but also people that are interested in measuring the impact that media is having for their clients.",
  "So I've been doing this for about 17 years now and have seen a lot of evolution in the space from data availability, from different modeling techniques becoming more advanced but also more accessible, and it's just been a really cool journey to see how it's evolved, how analytics has become more mainstream, and how people are getting more excited about it.",
  "Metadata is basically the key to your larger data set.",
  "It helps describe what's in the rows and the columns of the data that you'll be working with.",
  "Metadata is kind of a shorthand or a CliffsNotes version of a much more complex set of information.",
  "It can be helpful in just kind of helping you get a handle on what's in a single data set that you may have access to.",
  "It's an important part of the discovery process of any analytics project as you're working with either a client or a vendor to understand the resources that you'll have to address a problem and what might be missing.",
  "It just gives you the keys to unlock that data in a really simple and straightforward way and is a great communication tool.",
  "When I was working for an advertiser, one of the things that we were trying to do was build something called a data lake.",
  "So essentially, this is bringing together all of the sources of data that you might want to use in an analysis into one place, which can be really, really tricky.",
  "One of the benefits of metadata was figuring out where we had sources that may overlap, where we had data sources that had things in common.",
  "And what the unique pieces of information were that we were getting from each of those data sets.",
  "So as we thought about tackling this really huge and important project, we were able to use metadata to quickly and easily get to the basic constructs that we were trying to tackle.",
  "When you're working with people who maybe don't have analytics as their day job, getting that \"aha\" moment, helping them understand how measurement and analytics are tools that can help them achieve their goals, is really important.",
  "And just getting to that idea of you made something that was previously inaccessible a little bit more accessible for that team and something they feel comfortable putting into practice is really important and really kind of a great way to come out of a partnership.",
  "[SOUND].",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-preparation/lecture/jj7B1/working-with-more-data-sources\">[SOUND]</a>",
  "Working with more data sources.",
  "In this video, we'll discuss the different places data analysts go to connect with data.",
  "There's all kinds of data out there and it's important to know how to access it.",
  "Earlier, you learn that there are two basic types of data used by data analysts: internal and external.",
  "Internal data is data that lives within a company's own systems.",
  "It's typically also generated from within the company.",
  "You may also hear internal data described as primary data.",
  "External data is data that lives and is generated outside an organization.",
  "It can come from a variety of places, including other businesses, government sources, the media, professional associations, schools, and more.",
  "External data is sometimes called secondary data.",
  "Gathering internal data can be complicated.",
  "Depending on your data analytics project, you might need data from lots of different sources and departments, including sales, marketing, customer relationship management, finance, human resources, and even the data archives.",
  "But the effort is worth it.",
  "Internal data has plenty of advantages for a business.",
  "It provides information that's relevant to problems you're trying to solve, and it's free to access because the company already owns it.",
  "With internal data, analysts can work on all data projects without ever looking beyond their own walls.",
  "But sometimes internal data doesn't give you the full picture.",
  "In those cases, data analysts can turn to external data and apply that information to their analysis.",
  "For instance, as health care analysts, we often partner with other healthcare organizations or nonprofits and use their data to create deeper analyses and add some more industry- level perspective.",
  "In an earlier video, you learned that openness has created a lot of data for analysts to use, largely through open data initiatives.",
  "As a reminder, openness or open data refers to the free access, usage and sharing of data.",
  "For example, the United States government makes hundreds of thousands of data sets available to the public on Data.gov.",
  "These data sets contain information on weather patterns, educational progress, crime rates, transportation, and much more.",
  "There are lots of reasons for these open data initiatives.",
  "One is to make government activities more transparent, like letting the public see where money is spent.",
  "It also helps educate citizens about voting and local issues.",
  "Open data also improves public service by giving people ways to be a part of public planning or provide feedback to the government.",
  "Finally, open data leads to innovation and economic growth by helping people and companies better understand their markets.",
  "Google actually hosts lots of public databases with information on science, transportation, economics, climate, and more.",
  "As an example, a bike sharing company could use traffic data from within our public transportation database to see where the roads are busiest, then choose those locations for their bikes in order to reduce cars on the road and give people another transportation option.",
  "Now you're familiar with internal and external data and how you can access both.",
  "Coming up, we'll learn how to import all the data you collect from different sources into a spreadsheet.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-preparation/lecture/KCphN/importing-data-from-spreadsheets-and-databases\">Coming up, we'll learn how to import all the data you collect from different sources into a spreadsheet.</a>",
  "Importing data from spreadsheets and databases.",
  "At this point, you've learned all about internal and external data, and how to prepare it for use.",
  "Now, we'll go through the process of actually importing data from different sources.",
  "Sometimes you want to upload a spreadsheet from your files, such as a CSV file.",
  "CSV stands for comma-separated values.",
  "A CSV file saves data in a table format.",
  "Now, let's bring that file into a fresh spreadsheet.",
  "We'll start by selecting a file, then import.",
  "Then we'll choose to upload a file.",
  "Navigate to it, open it and insert it as a new sheet.",
  "CSV files use plain text and they're delineated by characters.",
  "So each column or field is clearly distinct from another when importing.",
  "As you learned, CSVs are comma-separated, and usually the spreadsheet app will auto-detect those separations.",
  "But sometimes, you might need to indicate that the separator is another character or a space by selecting the different options in this window.",
  "Also, if you are planning to work with the data set, you would usually convert to text, numbers or other options here.",
  "But plain text is okay for reporting purposes.",
  "So we can leave those fields alone.",
  "Finally, select Import data.",
  "Now our CSV file's ready to work with in our spreadsheet.",
  "I spend most of my time at work analyzing spreadsheets full of healthcare information.",
  "I typically start by looking at a larger data set.",
  "Then I pull a subset of it into a spreadsheet so I can work with it.",
  "Maybe I want to analyze year over year growth in user demand on Google Search for certain healthcare services, like telemedicine.",
  "Or maybe I want to look at data sets from external healthcare organizations or agencies for more insight into this trend.",
  "For example, with telemedicine, maybe I'll look at a spreadsheet that lists telemedicine providers.",
  "There are so many ways spreadsheets can help you find the insights you need.",
  "One source I use a lot is the World Health Organization's data repository.",
  "This is a place where anybody can access open-source data.",
  "As you can see, there's tons of data available.",
  "You can search by theme, category, indicator and country.",
  "You can also access World Health Organization metadata if you want to learn more about the data in the repository.",
  "For our example, we'll look at medical doctors by country and year.",
  "This information would be useful for a data analysis project looking into how many doctors are available to treat patients within a certain population compared to other populations.",
  "To get this data, we'll start on this webpage, which contains the data set we want.",
  "Then we'll download the data as a CSV file.",
  "Then open a new spreadsheet and import the file by selecting File, Import.",
  "Next, upload your file and select Import Data.",
  "After reviewing the data to make sure it looks clean, we can title it and begin our work.",
  "I know this is a lot of information to take in, but you'll get much more comfortable with this the more you practice.",
  "Coming up, we'll learn how to sort and filter your data to focus on the information relevant to you.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-preparation/lecture/LUq19/sorting-and-filtering\">Coming up, we'll learn how to sort and filter your data to focus on the information relevant to you.</a>",
  "Sorting and filtering.",
  "In the past few videos, you've learned about both internal and external data.",
  "Now I'll show you how to focus on only the data that's relevant to the problem you're trying to solve.",
  "This is useful if you're working with a very large complex spreadsheet, which data analysts encounter all the time.",
  "Having lots of data can make it difficult to quickly find and analyze the information you need.",
  "No two analytics projects are the same.",
  "Often data analysts process, view, and use data very differently, even if it comes from the exact same source.",
  "Here's an example.",
  "Check out this spreadsheet that shows a company's sales reps and where they work.",
  "Different data analysts might want different information from the spreadsheet, and that's where sorting and filtering comes in.",
  "Sorting and filtering the data in a spreadsheet helps us customize the way data is presented.",
  "They can also organize data so analysts can zoom in on the pieces that matter.",
  "Think of it like a magnifying glass for our data.",
  "Let's begin with sorting.",
  "Sorting involves arranging data into a meaningful order to make it easier to understand, analyze, and visualize.",
  "Data can be sorted in ascending or descending order, and alphabetically or numerically.",
  "Sorting can be done across all of a spreadsheet or just in a single column or table.",
  "You can also sort by multiple variables.",
  "For instance, if our data set contains both city and state fields, we can sort first by city and then by state.",
  "Anytime you're sorting data, it's always a good idea to freeze the header row first.",
  "To do this, we'll highlight the row.",
  "Then from the view menu, choose freeze and one row.",
  "This locks the row in place.",
  "Now when we scroll down the sheet, the header row stays visible so we know the category of each column.",
  "Looks good to me.",
  "Now let's sort the entire spreadsheet.",
  "We'll sort by city first.",
  "To do this, select the city column, then use the drop-down arrow to sort the sheet.",
  "Select A to Z.",
  "This will sort all the columns from A to Z by row, with the selected column being the primary sort criteria.",
  "The cities are now sorted alphabetically, and they're still grouped with the corresponding states, sales reps, and auto parts.",
  "The details across each row are automatically kept together when sorting a particular section, as you can see here.",
  "Multiple criteria sorting is another very useful data analysis tool.",
  "For instance, let's say we want to see a list of sales reps by the cities and states in which they work.",
  "First, we select the entire data set, then choose data and sort range.",
  "In the dialog box, make sure that \"Data has header row\" is highlighted.",
  "That way row A, city, states, sales rep, and auto parts won't be part of the sort.",
  "Then in the sort by drop-down menu, select state and the sort order A to Z.",
  "Now add another sort column.",
  "In the \"then by\" drop-down, select city and the sort order A to Z.",
  "Finally, select Sort.",
  "Now we can search the data to easily find a sales rep who works in a particular state and city.",
  "Sorting is useful when you want to look at everything in a spreadsheet in alphabetical or numerical order.",
  "But sometimes data analysts want to isolate a particular piece of information.",
  "To do this, they use a filter.",
  "Filtering means showing only the data that meets a specific criteria while hiding the rest.",
  "A filter simplifies a spreadsheet by only showing us the information we need.",
  "For example, we could add a filter to see only the sales reps who worked with a particular product.",
  "To do this, we first select Data and Create a filter.",
  "Choose the column with the data we need.",
  "In this case, Auto Parts.",
  "Filter buttons will appear in the corner of each column header.",
  "To filter our spreadsheet by auto part, click the button in the Auto Parts header.",
  "In this example, let's say we want to only see sales reps who worked with rims.",
  "Remove the check marks from the categories we don't want to see, which is everything except for rims.",
  "Then select okay.",
  "The filter temporarily hides anything that doesn't meet the condition.",
  "But note that, even though they aren't visible, they're still there.",
  "When it's time to view the entire area spreadsheet again, simply turn off the filter.",
  "Sorting and filtering are very important tools in the data analyst's toolbox.",
  "In the next video, you'll discover even more ways to narrow in on the exact information you need for any data analysis project.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-preparation/lecture/YCkys/setting-up-bigquery-including-sandbox-and-billing-options\">In the next video, you'll discover even more ways to narrow in on the exact information you need for any data analysis project.</a>",
  "Setting up BigQuery, including sandbox and billing options.",
  "Hi.",
  "Welcome back.",
  "Throughout this course, you've seen how BigQuery can be used to view and analyze data from tons of sources.",
  "Now we're going to explore the different account tiers that BigQuery offers, so you know how to choose the right one for your needs, and how you can access them.",
  "BigQuery is offered to you at no charge.",
  "There are paid options available, but we won't need them for the activities in this course.",
  "Instead, we're going to talk about two account types: sandbox, and free trial.",
  "A Sandbox account is available at no charge and anyone with a Google account can log in and use it.",
  "There are a couple of limitations to this account type.",
  "For example, you get a maximum of 12 projects at a time.",
  "This means that if you want to make a 13th project, you'll have to delete one of your original 12.",
  "It also doesn't allow you to insert new records to a database or update the field values of existing records.",
  "These Data Manipulation Language or DML operations aren't supported in the sandbox.",
  "However, you won't need to do this in course activities.",
  "You can read more about the limitations of a sandbox account in the BigQuery documentation.",
  "This is the account type we'll use for most of our activities.",
  "It's simple to set up.",
  "So, later in this video we'll walk through the steps required to create an account.",
  "Before that though, we should talk about the other way to use BigQuery without charges.",
  "The Google Cloud free trial.",
  "The free trial gives you access to more of what BigQuery has to offer with fewer overall limitations.",
  "The free trial offers $300 in credit for use in Google Cloud during the first 90 days.",
  "You won't get anywhere near that spending limit if you just use the BigQuery console to practice SQL queries.",
  "After you spend the $300 credit or after 90 days, your free trial will expire and you will need to personally select to upgrade to a paid account to keep working in Google Cloud.",
  "Your method of payment will not be automatically charged after your free trial ends.",
  "The free trial does require that you set up a payment option with Google Cloud.",
  "But unless you choose to opt-in for an account upgrade, it won't charge you.",
  "However, it does require you to enter a payment type.",
  "So, we understand if you don't feel comfortable with this option.",
  "This is one reason the BigQuery sandbox account exists, so you don't have to enter any payment information.",
  "With either type of account, you can upgrade to a paid account at anytime and retain all of your existing projects.",
  "If you set up a free trial account but choose not to upgrade to a paid account when your trial period ends, you can set up a free sandbox account at that time.",
  "However, projects from your trial won't transfer to your sandbox.",
  "It would be like starting from scratch.",
  "Just something to keep in mind.",
  "Now we're going to set up your sandbox account, which you can change into a free trial or upgrade to a paid account if you choose.",
  "First, we'll go to the BigQuery sandbox documentation page.",
  "Then go to the upper right corner and log in to whichever Google account you want to use for the BigQuery sandbox account.",
  "Then we'll select the \"Go to BigQuery\" button on the documentation page.",
  "This gives us a drop-down to select a country and to read the terms of service agreement.",
  "This will bring us to the SQL workspace, which we'll be using an upcoming activities.",
  "Choose \"Create Project\" and name the project and give it an ID.",
  "Choose \"Create,\" and then \"Done.\" There we have it.",
  "In the next video, we'll explore what each part of the SQL workspace does and how we'll use it in future activities.",
  "See you there.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-preparation/lecture/77132/how-to-use-bigquery\">See you there.</a>",
  "How to use BigQuery.",
  "Hey there.",
  "In this video, we're going to learn about each part of the BigQuery SQL workspace so you can use it during this course and throughout your career as a data analyst.",
  "It's an extremely valuable and widely popular tool, so understanding how it works is super helpful.",
  "Feel free to follow along on your screen as we explore BigQuery.",
  "You may notice that my screen appears a little different than yours, since BigQuery is constantly updating its interface.",
  "Don't worry if this happens as minor differences won't stop you from understanding the basics.",
  "To begin, go to the BigQuery landing page, then login to the account you created earlier.",
  "To navigate to the SQL workspace, select the menu on the left side of the screen and scroll down to the Big Data header.",
  "Then hover over the BigQuery label and click ''SQL workspace'' from the drop-down.",
  "Now that we're in the SQL workspace, we're going to search for public datasets, select a dataset through the Data Explorer, run a query, and upload our own data for querying.",
  "First, we'll search for a public dataset to use.",
  "To select a public dataset, navigate to the Explorer menu on the left side of the screen.",
  "Click the \"Add Data\" button in the upper right of the menu.",
  "Then in the drop-down menu, select \"Explore public datasets.\" This will open the marketplace and show you available public datasets.",
  "Let's go to the search marketplace bar and search for noaa_lightning, a dataset we'll use in an upcoming activity.",
  "Click on the ''Cloud-to-Ground Lightning Strikes'' dataset.",
  "This will give us a description and preview of the dataset which captures observations about lightning activity and weather patterns in the United States.",
  "Click \"View dataset.\" This will bring you back to the SQL workspace and create a tab for the dataset.",
  "We can then move back to the Editor tab we have opened, or click \"Compose new query\" to begin writing with SQL.",
  "On the left, notice that the BigQuery public data drop-down list is in the Explorer menu.",
  "We can click the arrow to expand the BigQuery data list and pick out a new dataset.",
  "Let's select the first dataset in the drop-down list, austin_311.",
  "When we do, it expands to show the table within the dataset.",
  "We can open the dataset for a preview.",
  "The Schema tab contains the names of each column in the dataset.",
  "The Details tab contains additional metadata, such as the creation date of the dataset.",
  "The Preview tab contains the first rows from the dataset.",
  "On this page, we can click \"Query\" to automatically create a new editor window with the template for a query already populated.",
  "From here, put an asterisk after Select, where our cursor pops up, then run the query.",
  "Congratulations, you ran a SQL query in BigQuery.",
  "The query you ran returned rows from the dataset which populate in a window beneath the editor interface.",
  "Results from any query you run will also display here.",
  "Now let's say you have the results of a survey that you want to upload to BigQuery and analyze using SQL.",
  "To add your own data to BigQuery, choose the ID of the project you want to add to.",
  "Select the three vertical dots icon to open options for the project then choose \"Create dataset.\" Name the dataset something that will help you identify it later, such as upload_test_dataset.",
  "Then click \"Create dataset.\" Next, go to the Explorer menu and choose the three vertical dots next to the dataset under the Projects drop down.",
  "Now we'll select the icon for create table, which opens a pop-up window.",
  "Under Source and create table from, select \"Upload\" or whichever method you prefer to upload your data.",
  "Here, we can upload any data file, such as a CSV file.",
  "Let's give our table a helpful name such as test_table.",
  "Make sure that the schema is set to auto detect and select \"Create table.\" There's more to come with BigQuery.",
  "Feel free to re-watch this video anytime and keep practicing.",
  "See you soon.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-preparation/lecture/H877e/bigquery-in-action\">See you soon.</a>",
  "BigQuery in action.",
  "You've learned how sorting and filtering data in spreadsheets helps data analysts customize the information.",
  "Customizing data makes it more meaningful and easier to understand, analyze, and visualize.",
  "You also discovered that some spreadsheets can be extremely long and complex.",
  "So knowing how to zero in on the exact data you need while setting aside the rest helps you focus on your analysis.",
  "This is also true for databases.",
  "Sometimes a data set is too large to download, or it won't fit in a spreadsheet.",
  "So a data analyst will use SQL to create a query to view the specific data that they want from within the larger set.",
  "We've learned that a database is a collection of data stored in a computer system.",
  "And that SQL stands for Structured Query Language.",
  "Data analysts use query languages to communicate with the database.",
  "In an earlier video you also learned that a relational database contains a series of tables that can be connected to form relationships.",
  "These relationships are represented by primary and foreign keys.",
  "Data analysts write queries in order to get data from these tables.",
  "Let's see how this works.",
  "We'll start with our table viewer.",
  "Here we can see what public data sets are available.",
  "We'll scroll through the data before we start using it to get a feel for what it's all about, and to make sure it's clean.",
  "Some table viewers let you preview a few rows before even writing a query.",
  "This is helpful if you want to take a quick look to be sure the data set will be right for your project.",
  "To show you how this works, let's check out a sample data set.",
  "This one shows how much sunlight hits rooftops in a year.",
  "This would be very useful for a data analyst working on a solar energy project, for example.",
  "We'll start by previewing the data set.",
  "Click on it, like this.",
  "Then we'll select a subset of this data, where we find regions, states, yearly sunlight and more.",
  "Now to see the entire data set, let's write a query.",
  "The first step is finding out the complete correct name of the data set.",
  "To do this, select the data set, solar potential by postal code, and select query table.",
  "The name of the data set is shown inside the two backticks.",
  "This is to help us read the query more easily.",
  "We can also remove the backticks in this case, and our query would still run.",
  "The words you see before the dot represent the database name.",
  "And the words after the dot represent the table name.",
  "Let's select and copy the data set name now because we'll need it in a second.",
  "Now we'll click on the plus sign to compose a new query.",
  "Most queries begin with the word SELECT.",
  "Then we add a space.",
  "Because we want to see the entire data set, we'll put an asterisk next.",
  "The asterisk says we want to include all columns.",
  "This is a great shortcut because without it, we'd have to type in every single field name.",
  "Next we'll press return and type FROM.",
  "FROM does just what it sounds like.",
  "It indicates where the data is coming from.",
  "After that, we'll add another space.",
  "Now, we paste in the name of the data set that we copied earlier.",
  "And finally, run the query.",
  "Now, you can carefully inspect the data set before we begin working with it.",
  "One important thing to keep in mind: SQL queries can be written in a lot of different ways, but still provide the same results.",
  "For example, we could have written this query as one long line of instructions like this, and we'd still get the same results.",
  "The additional lines and spaces don't impact the query's outcome, but they keep your query organized and easier to read for yourself and others.",
  "Now, if the project doesn't require all of these fields, we can use SQL to view a particular piece or pieces of data.",
  "To do this, we specify a certain column name in the query.",
  "For example, maybe we only want to see data from Pennsylvania.",
  "So we'll begin our query the same way we just learned.",
  "SELECT, space, add an asterisk.",
  "Then FROM our solar potential database.",
  "But this time we'll add WHERE.",
  "WHERE also does exactly what it sounds like.",
  "It tells the database where to look for information.",
  "In this case, the state name column.",
  "So add a space and state underscore name, the name of the column.",
  "Now because we only want to see data from Pennsylvania, we add an equal sign and the word Pennsylvania with single quotes around it.",
  "In SQL single quotes indicate the beginning and ending of a string.",
  "Finally, we run the query.",
  "Now we can review the data on solar potential for only Pennsylvania.",
  "Now we've got the data we want and we're ready to start putting it to work, which we'll cover later on.",
  "But for now, let's celebrate finishing another module.",
  "You've covered a lot of complex and highly technical information.",
  "As you keep practicing though, things will start to feel a lot more natural.",
  "For now, take a moment to sit back and think about all you've learned.",
  "You discovered metadata and how it keeps data organized by describing what that data is all about.",
  "You've seen how internal and external data are accessed and how data analysts use them to find compelling insights to solve business problems.",
  "And you can sort and filter your data to really pinpoint the information you need.",
  "Finally, you just learned about queries and you even practiced writing some.",
  "Coming up, you'll have a few readings and then a weekly challenge to test your knowledge.",
  "This will help you confirm that you've understood what we've worked on in these videos.",
  "And as always, if you're ever unsure about a question, I highly encourage you to review the videos and readings to find the answer.",
  "You're the data detective now, so use those skills.",
  "Keep up the great work and I'll see you after the weekly challenge.",
