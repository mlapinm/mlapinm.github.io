  "Tofu, can you take the floor please.",
  "I will climb up the ladder and do the shelves at the top.",
  "Why do I have to do the floor?.",
  "Because the shelves are higher and tougher to clean.",
  "You are just saying that because you don’t want to do the floors.",
  "Ohh!!! boy, Tofu! It’s not that!.",
  "You won’t be able to reach the shelves, trust me.",
  "Sure, I will be.",
  "okay, come on up then.",
  "But let me tell you, you’re being like the crab.",
  "like the crab?.",
  "now whats that.",
  "come I tell you a story.",
  "Once upon a time, there lived a crab in the sea.",
  "I am so bored of living in the sea.",
  "I think the meadow behind the beach is a better place for me to be.",
  "I will move there.",
  "And so, the crab came out of the water.",
  "and made its way beyond the beach.",
  "and into the meadow.",
  "Ah, this is the life.",
  "I wonder why I didn’t do this earlier.",
  "Unknown to the crab.",
  "a fox had been watching him since the moment he came into the meadow.",
  "And one day.",
  "when he found the right moment, he attacked him.",
  "I have been waiting for this moment.",
  "I will eat you now.",
  "The crab tried to hide.",
  "but it didn’t know how to.",
  "Not on land anyway.",
  "he was not familiar with the terrain at all!.",
  "Its my fault.",
  "I should have stayed in the seas and the beach.",
  "where I belong and know how to protect myself.",
  "Well, yes.",
  "But now its too late for you.",
  "Saying so, the fox quickly ate the crab and ended his life.",
  "Do you still think, you can handle the tall shelves?.",
  "I think I will wait till next year to find out.",
  "For now, I will just take care of the floors."
