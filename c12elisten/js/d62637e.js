  "Hello, hello.",
  "Welcome to English with Max.",
  "In today's video I'm going to teach you the names of common kitchen utensils.",
  "I'm also going to explain some of their perhaps not-so-common uses.",
  "Let's start with my favourite utensil: the bottle opener.",
  "You use this to OPEN BOTTLES.",
  "That is, of course, if you don't want to use your teeth, or your eye socket.",
  "Hmm, very classy.",
  "And now my second favourite utensil: the can opener.",
  "some can openers look like this, but I prefer these ones.",
  "A can opener is used to open these things: CANS.",
  "That is, of course, if they don't have this handy ring on top.",
  "I'm sure it's happened to all of us: You go to the supermarket, you see a tin, you think, \"Ooh, that looks good.\" Well, it's probably just because you're cheap and too lazy to cook.",
  "But anyway, you take it home, you want to open it, and you see this.",
  "Another necessity of life is this: a cork screw.",
  "Cork screws are rather useful if you live in one of the many European countries that still insists on using these: corks.",
  "Hence, CORK SCREW.",
  "Because, after all, I mean, these bottles are just so much more difficult to open, and the wine doesn't taste nearly as good because there's no cork in it.",
  "\"Hello!.",
  "Yes, I live next door.",
  "Um, I was just wondering if you had a... cork screw?.",
  "Get it?.",
  "'Screw'.\" This is why I'm still single.",
  "This is a rolling pin.",
  "I don't know how many people actually still have these.",
  "I think the last time I used mine was to either crush ice, or to kill a cockroach.",
  "This, boys and girls, is a ladle.",
  "Ladles are used to serve soup or stews.",
  "If you haven't heard the word \"stew\", it's just a thicker soup.",
  "You can also use ladles as a spoon, if your sink looks like this: and your drawer looks like this: Oh, what would my mother say?.",
  "But it is a little more refined to use cutlery.",
  "This is a knife, this is a spoon, and this is a fork.",
  "Remember that \"cutlery\" is uncountable so you cannot say \"a cutlery\". Either \"cutlery\" or \"the cutlery\", depending on whether or not you want to be specific.",
  "As I just said, this utensil is called a knife, but a knife can also look like this: And if you are not a caveman, you will preferably use one of these when using your knife.",
  "This is called a chopping board or a cutting board.",
  "Spoons can also look like this.",
  "These are wooden spoons.",
  "Also another option if your sink looks like this: This is a spatula.",
  "I'm sure most of you have one of these.",
  "Most of us occasionally eat eggs or pancakes.",
  "I normally just use it to kill flies.",
  "I'm Australian.",
  "This is a peeler.",
  "You use this to remove the skin off fruit and vegetables.",
  "I can't actually think of any other use for this.",
  "If you can though, please write it in the comments.",
  "This one here is called a funnel.",
  "This can be very, very useful.",
  "This one is called a sieve.",
  "Normally you use this for flour when you want to make a cake or something.",
  "Please note the spelling of this word.",
  "No, it doesn't make sense, but who said that English was there to make our lives easy?.",
  "And how could I forget this?.",
  "This is a frypan, also known as a frying pan.",
  "Frypans come in all different shapes and sizes, and even if you don't have a sieve or a funnel, if you are no longer living with your parents, I truly hope that you have one of these.",
  "And finally, this item has the simplest name of all.",
  "This is a pot.",
  "You might have heard this word before.",
  "\"Pot\" is a slang word for marijuana.",
  "So if you haven't spent a lot of time in the kitchen, but you've spent a lot of time engaged in... other activities, you most likely will have heard the word \"pot\". But be careful!.",
  "If you are using \"pot\" to refer to marijuana, it is uncountable and if you are using it to refer to this thing, it is countable.",
  "So you can say, \"I have one pot, he has two pots,\" etc, etc.",
  "If you liked the video, guys, please don't forget to click on the thumbs up, and also to subscribe to my channel.",
  "See ya next time.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DMiUMLBVto&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=40\">See ya next time.</a>",
  "Hi guys, welcome back to my channel, and welcome to another vocabulary lesson.",
  "In today's video I am going to teach you the names for rather common household tools.",
  "Some of you might be aware that the word \"tool\" can also mean idiot.",
  "So just so we're clear, when I say \"household tool\" in this video, I am not talking about that annoying cousin who won't go away and just hangs around your house like a bad smell.",
  "I'm talking about... these things.",
  "To start with we have a spanner, which is also known as a wrench in the US.",
  "This particular spanner is an adjustable spanner because you can use it on different-sized objects.",
  "Normally it's used to tighten or fasten nuts and bolts, but you can also use it in emergency situations to hold onto things such as this.",
  "This is another type of spanner, but this one is called a ring spanner, just like the ring on your finger.",
  "Hmm, would that work?.",
  "No, maybe not.",
  "So you use this to fasten and tighten nuts on the end of bolts.",
  "This is perhaps not the right size, but I think you get the idea.",
  "So what I'm taking off there is a nut.",
  "Normally they're hexagonal in shape.",
  "This is a washer - a washer that's seen better days.",
  "And on the right we have a bolt.",
  "This is a regular spanner, but like the ring spanner it comes in all different shapes and sizes - how exciting.",
  "This is a pair of pliers, which you can use to hold onto things, and twist things like your brother's nose, for example.",
  "And it can also be used in emergency situations.",
  "If you've ever bought furniture at Ikea then you probably have a couple of these.",
  "These are Allen keys, and you use them to tighten nuts and screws.",
  "Speaking of screws, here is a screwdriver.",
  "This is a flat-headed screwdriver for those very common screws that just have an indented line in the top, or a slot.",
  "I don't think this one is the right size.",
  "I clearly wasn't supposed to be a builder.",
  "It's always nice when you know you haven't missed your vocation.",
  "This one here is a Phillips head screwdriver, used with Phillips head screws.",
  "That sounds oddly like a sexual position.",
  "This is an electric drill.",
  "I can feel the vibrations already.",
  "You use this to put holes into things, but for body piercing I do recommend you go to a professional piercer.",
  "These are drill bits - if you want to change the size of your holes.",
  "And if you are very young, unless you are Amish, you probably haven't seen one of these.",
  "This is a hand drill.",
  "So just like the electric drill, but you use your hand instead of electricity.",
  "This is a tomahawk, but I know it looks very similar to an axe.",
  "You can use it just like an axe for cutting off fingers or cutting down your neighbour's tree.",
  "This is a chisel.",
  "Seeing as they've been around for thousands of years, I probably don't need to explain what you use it for.",
  "Normally you do use it with one of these - a hammer.",
  "But I better not do that on my mother's dining room table.",
  "And here we have a mallet - a bit like a hammer, but you use it for big, serious stuff, like tent pegs or your ex-boyfriend's presents.",
  "Here we have a saw.",
  "This is a wood saw.",
  "As you can imagine it's used for cutting wood.",
  "If you want to cut metal you need a hacksaw, which you often see in movies hidden in the birthday cakes of prisoners wanting to escape.",
  "This is a scraper - used to remove wallpaper or paint.",
  "And here we have a tape measure.",
  "This tape measure has a small spirit level on the top here.",
  "A spirit level is used to check if a surface is horizontal.",
  "This is a bigger spirit level.",
  "And it's called a spirit level because this liquid is normally a type of alcohol.",
  "Don't you like the sound of that?.",
  "That's it for today, guys.",
  "If you enjoyed the video, please don't forget to click on the thumbs up, and if you have any questions or requests for other videos, please don't hesitate to write them in the - uh, no, not the info box - in the comments down below.",
  "I have also put some links in the info box.",
  "I have Facebook, I have Twitter.",
  "I think that's it.",
  "See ya next time!.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7HCJYcYHI0&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=39\">See ya next time!</a>",
  "Hi guys!.",
  "Welcome back to English with Max.",
  "Today I am going to teach you some train- and travel-related vocabulary.",
  "I did actually catch a train recently.",
  "Last week I went to Sydney and I filmed parts of the journey to later share the experience with you.",
  "It was a rather long journey.",
  "It took 9 hours.",
  "Yeah, Australia's known for many good things, but public transport isn't one of them.",
  "In any case, if you would like to learn some train vocabulary, or if you would just like to see what it's like to travel by train in Australia, I recommend that you keep watching.",
  "In the beginning of the video I do speak a little bit quickly, so if you find it hard to understand, I suggest that you click on the CC button to get subtitles.",
  "I have also put a list of the vocabulary in the info box below and there will also be a list at the end.",
  "Ok, so here we are at the train station.",
  "I probably don't look my best this morning because we had to get up at sparrow's fart, which is another way of saying \"really early\". You can also say: \"at the crack of dawn,\" or if you are Australian, you could just say: \"too bloody early.\" It's also raining, to add insult to injury.",
  "I don't know if you can see.",
  "I apologise for the quality.",
  "I'm not filming on my normal camera, I'm filming on my phone today.",
  "Oh it looks like some children have arrived.",
  "So we are catching the train because we decided to go to Sydney last minute.",
  "Most normal people do catch the plane, but ah, well, we are a little bit cheap, and the plane tickets were a bit expensive.",
  "\"Cheap\" is just another way of saying \"stingy\". Now, this journey's going to take about 9 hours - that's 9 hours to travel 500 km.",
  "Something tells me we're not in Europe anymore.",
  "Oh there are people arriving.",
  "The train is about to arrive.",
  "It's very exciting.",
  "Ok, so here we are on the train now.",
  "I'm actually really excited because, as some of you might know if you've watched my other videos, I live in a town in Australia called Coffs Harbour.",
  "Coffs Harbour is the town where I grew up, but I only moved back about 3 months ago, and I haven't left it since.",
  "Before that I was living in Paris off and on for about 6 years, so moving back to Coffs Harbour was quite a shock to the system.",
  "\"A shock to the system\" - that's a nice expression.",
  "Anyway, today we are going to Sydney, the big smoke.",
  "\"The big smoke\" is a way to express a big city, basically.",
  "Something that Coffs Harbour isn't...exactly.",
  "Now, one thing you can do on a train to pass the time is, of course, eat.",
  "Which is why I am now heading towards the buffet car.",
  "I apologise for not holding the camera very straight.",
  "I don't want it to be very obvious that I'm filming and have the guy working there think that I'm a crazy person.",
  "Now we are having breakfast.",
  "As you can see, Mum is making our teas, and we are going to eat these, which we brought from home.",
  "It is about ten to seven (6:50) in the morning.",
  "Later on we will probably have a second breakfast because that is what you do when you sit on a train for 9 hours.",
  "These are our tickets.",
  "I'm sure that's not a new word for most of you.",
  "Up there you can see a luggage rack, which is where you can put your luggage, or your other belongings - you can see our things there.",
  "And here we have two reading lights.",
  "That is the emergency exit, which is the door that you exit by if there is an emergency, like a fire or a crazy person running around.",
  "This is the inside of our carriage.",
  "You can also say \"car\", so we are in car E.",
  "And we deliberately chose car E because we were pretty sure that it was going to be empty.",
  "The part in the middle between the seats, so the part where you walk, is called the aisle.",
  "Yes, the \"s\" is silent.",
  "You also have aisles in airplanes, and when you book a ticket, you can decide whether you have a window seat or an aisle seat.",
  "So 3 is the window seat and 4 is the aisle seat.",
  "As you can see, Mum is in the aisle seat.",
  "\"Crew only\" means that only the crew, so only the people working on the train, are allowed to pass through.",
  "Now, travelling by train in Australia is not quite as fascinating as many people might think.",
  "You don't see koalas, you don't see kangaroos, and you do not see Crocodile Dundee.",
  "You basically see fields, sometimes a river, some buildings.",
  "And you see cows.",
  "More cows.",
  "Because there isn't much to see out the window, we brought several things with us to keep us occupied.",
  "As you can see, Frank has come along too, and he's very excited as well.",
  "Here we have an iPad, I have my computer, we each have a book.",
  "We have several episodes of Survivor to watch, we have some films.",
  "There unfortunately is no WiFi on the train, and we're hoping that the power on our devices lasts because there are no power outlets.",
  "Something tells me we're not in Europe anymore.",
  "Now we are having our second breakfast.",
  "I'm having a savoury croissant, and because we're in Australia it's served with tomato sauce, which is also known as ketchup in other countries.",
  "Mum's having a pie, which is very Australian.",
  "More cows.",
  "This is the sign right in front of us.",
  "It says: \"We're watching out for you.",
  "Staff are now wearing personal safety cameras, which are monitored 24/7, to help you stay safe.",
  "Audio and camera images may be used by police.",
  "If you see bad behaviour or feel unsafe, tell a staff member right away.\" This means that the people working on the train all have cameras attached to their bodies.",
  "Like in a spy movie.",
  "I don't know about you, but that doesn't really make me feel safe.",
  "Lunchtime!.",
  "What are we having for lunch?.",
  "We are having vegetarian lasagne.",
  "Mmm, yummy!.",
  "More cows.",
  "We have just stopped for a few minutes in a small town called Dungog.",
  "This is true, rural Australia.",
  "I'm almost sad we're not spending the night here because I'm guessing they must have a fascinating nightlife.",
  "Up ahead you can see some train tracks - we still have about 200 km to go.",
  "In any case, whenever I complain about living in a small town such as Coffs Harbour, I can always comfort myself by remembering that I don't live in Dungog.",
  "Now we are returning to civilisation.",
  "We are now in the outer suburbs of Sydney, which means that we are about 20 minutes away from our final destination.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAu3mUIaYws&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=38\">We are now in the outer suburbs of Sydney, which means that we are about 20 minutes away from our final destination.</a>",
  "Hi guys!.",
  "Welcome back to English with Max.",
  "Today I'm doing a video on the difference between shade and shadow.",
  "I’ll also show you some pictures to illustrate the differences.",
  "Many non-native speakers mix up these two words.",
  "I think probably because they're quite similar, but also because in some languages (maybe in many languages) there's only one word for this.",
  "In Spanish it's “sombra”, in French it’s “ombre” and in German it's “Schatten”. Let's first look at the meaning of shadow.",
  "A shadow is an area of darkness or a shape made by an object that is blocking rays of light.",
  "Now the light might be artificial light or it could be sunlight.",
  "\"Shade\", on the other hand, is an area of ground that is not being touched by direct light.",
  "Normally that light is sunlight.",
  "Now \"shade\" in this context is uncountable.",
  "So you cannot say \"a shade\". But you can say \"a shadow\". Now I understand that that might still be a bit unclear so right now we'll look at some pictures.",
  "This is a shadow created by this tree.",
  "This is my shadow.",
  "This is my shadow again.",
  "This is George's shadow.",
  "And here you can see part of my cat's shadow.",
  "We would call the darker parts in these pictures \"shade\". Here are Frank and George in the shade.",
  "Here George, the kangaroo, is in the sun, and Frank, the koala, is in the shade.",
  "If we summarise it, shade is a lot more general.",
  "It's the general area that the sun does not directly hit.",
  "A shadow, on the other hand, is a lot more specific.",
  "It's the dark shape that is created by a specific object.",
  "If you're outside, say you're at a picnic with some friends, you might say to them: \"Should we sit in the shade or the sun?\" You don't say: \"Should we sit in the shadow or the sun?\" Now technically you could say: \"Should we sit in that shadow?\" It's grammatically correct, but it's not a natural thing that native speakers would say.",
  "If you're outside and you want to distinguish between being in direct sunlight or being out of the sun, then you should say \"shade\". On a side note, \"shades\" with an \"s\" is also an informal way of saying \"sunglasses\". And for the ladies: this is eye shadow.",
  "In English you can't just say \"shadow\" for this.",
  "You have to say \"eye shadow\". That's it for today guys.",
  "I hope you enjoyed this video.",
  "If you did please give me a thumbs up, and don't forget to subscribe if you want to be updated on new videos.",
  "You can also follow me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
  "I've left the links in the info box below.",
  "And don't hesitate to leave a comment in the comments section if you wish.",
  "See ya next time!.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9kwEtbHrcE&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=37\">See ya next time!</a>",
  "Hi guys.",
  "Welcome back to English with Max.",
  "Because it's such a nice day today I thought it would be a good opportunity to show you my backyard, and in doing so, teach you some backyard- and garden-related vocabulary.",
  "Now some people do use the words \"backyard\" and \"garden\" interchangeably.",
  "Technically there is a slight difference.",
  "When you say \"garden\" people normally think of a place with lots of plants, you know, flowers, vegetables - that sort of thing.",
  "And a yard is just an area of land that's normally enclosed by a fence or something, and that is attached to a building.",
  "But seeing as most backyards have some sort of plants in them, we can say backyard or garden.",
  "OK, let's have a look.",
  "So starting there we have the back door - or one of the back doors - and that leads out onto our patio.",
  "This is a covered patio because it has a roof over it.",
  "It's a bit of a mess at the moment because it's not actually summer yet and we don't really use it until it gets quite hot.",
  "It's spring in Australia at the moment which means it's quite warm, but unlike in Europe where people will rush outside when it's 22 degrees, that's still a little bit cold for us.",
  "So we're waiting till it gets really hot and in a couple of months I'll show you what it looks like when we set it up nicely and sit outside here for cocktails.",
  "Along here you see a fence with vines on it, and just there you see some wind chimes.",
  "I made this in school when I was younger.",
  "I thought it was very artistic, but...yeah, we think lots of interesting things when we're teenagers.",
  "Now here we have more plants.",
  "Unfortunately I don't know their names, but I do know that that is a palm tree.",
  "We actually have three palm trees in our garden.",
  "Now in the corner there we used to have a fish pond, but it was becoming a bit too much work and there was only one fish left.",
  "We had three to begin with, but after a while we just had one rather large fish.",
  "That there with the water isn't exactly a fountain.",
  "We would just call this a water feature.",
  "and next to it is a lamp.",
  "There we have a statue.",
  "Around here we have a couple of other statues.",
  "See, that's a statue of Buddha and that's a statue of Buddha's head.",
  "This door here is our laundry door, so it's our other back door, and next to that you can see our hot water heater.",
  "It's quite a bit bigger than the one I had in Paris.",
  "That there is our shed, which is where we keep tools, our lawn mower and other things for the house and garden.",
  "This piece of concrete is of course a path, and the path leads to the clothesline.",
  "The clothesline is where we normally hang our wet clothes and sheets to dry, but today you can see Frank and George there.",
  "They were a bit dirty so we put them through the washing machine and hung them out here to dry in the sun.",
  "This particular type of clothesline is very specific to Australia and New Zealand.",
  "It was invented in Australia, about... I think about a hundred years ago, and it's called a Hills Hoist.",
  "It's really quite clever because you can take this leaver here and increase... oops... or decrease the height.",
  "Bye bye, guys.",
  "There is one more thing I want to show you.",
  "This is the garden hose.",
  "So you use this to water plants or to clean things.",
  "Thanks for watching, guys.",
  "I hope you found that interesting.",
  "If you did, please give me a thumbs up, and don't forget to subscribe if you want to be updated on more videos.",
  "You can also leave me a comment down below in the comments section, and you can also follow me on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter.",
  "See you next time!."
