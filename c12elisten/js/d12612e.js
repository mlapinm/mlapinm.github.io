  "i was actually quite happy this morning.",
  "i had no hangover.",
  "what about you.",
  "well i actually woke upthis morning quite.",
  "early i couldn't sleep so i was a littleannoyed.",
  "what time did you get up.",
  "i guess around eight o'clock that's not early.",
  "i was thinking it would be around five or six am.",
  "that is really early for me i went to bed at three o'clock.",
  "i thought you were an early bird.",
  "you are wrong i'm a night owl for sure.",
  "so i usually don't go to bed until about three am.",
  "i find it difficult to go to sleep early.",
  "don't you have to go to work.",
  "i am on my summer holiday now.",
  "if i have class from the first period every day.",
  "so i will have to get up about 7 30 or 8 am.",
  "so i will probably sleep earlier.",
  "it is really challenging for me you know.",
  "i tried to go to bed early 10 o'clock 11 30 before midnight and i try to get up early 6 30 7 before 8 but it doesn'talways work.",
  "what about you what time do you often go to bed.",
  "well i usually wake up maybe six or seven in the morning.",
  "but i don't get up straight away.",
  "i stay in bed for a while maybe read a book or something.",
  "check my phone messages and i get up at maybe 7 30 8 o'clock.",
  "on the weekend i often get up at 6 o'clock to go to the park with my father.",
  "we go jogging together.",
  "you are having a very healthy life.",
  "what about during the holiday.",
  "if it's a day off i get up at 9 or 10.",
  "and in the evening i usually go to bed around 10 11 sometimes 12.",
  "do you need an alarm clock to wake you up or you just wake up naturally every day.",
  "i actually have this kind of special mental ability.",
  "i feel it a bit weird i thought that everybody can do this but i found out it's not the case.",
  "but i can wake up exactly the minute i want anytime.",
  "that's amazing even though i wake up kinda easily.",
  "i can't wake up at a routine time.",
  "so i usually set the alarm on my phone and about two alarm clocks as well that will usually get me up.",
  "so like if i have to get up at 6 14 before i go to bed i can say okay get up at 6 14 and i'll wake up at exactly 6 14.",
  "how do you do that tell me please.",
  "yeah i don't know how i guess your brain can just keep time.",
  "when i tell people this sometimes they think oh come on that's not true.",
  "but really ever since i was a kid i could just tell myself what time i want to wake up and i'll wake up exactly at that time.",
  "that's really quite amazing i wish it was that way for me but it's not.",
  "yeah you know what's weird because i don't use alarm clocks.",
  "what do you mean.",
  "i can't like an alarm clock the idea actually i can't have a deep sleep if i know that it's going to ring and wake me up.",
  "an alarm clock is like somebody pouring cold water on you you know.",
  "yeah i'm always paranoid about being late so that's why i set three just in case one doesn't go off.",
  "but i can sleep any time of the day.",
  "wow that's like you do you like sleep.",
  "like it really doesn't matter what occasion or type of day it's very easy for me to fall asleep.",
  "for as long as whenever.",
  "so that's why i need to have many things to wake me up because i could sleep 12 or 14 hours and not wake up.",
  "so do you take naps.",
  "usually an hour.",
  "i find out if i go over an hour then that's the danger zone.",
  "because then if you sleep like two or three hours.",
  "you wake up and you're just groggy for the whole day.",
  "and if i sleep a lot during noon when i wake up i usually have headaches.",
  "so now i am trying not to take naps.",
  "like can you sleep with the light on.",
  "yes i can sleep in any situation light noise standing sitting up never matters to me i can still sleep.",
  "so you're definitely a deep sleeper i'm so jealous of that.",
  "like just a tiny bit of noise or a little bit of light and i can't sleep.",
  "and actually i probably only get an average of five hours a night but.",
  "i do sometimes take naps.",
  "yeah not for two i mean i can't sleep forever but like seven o'clock eight o'clock.",
  "then my body naturally wakes up.",
  "the flat i lived at before was incredibly crazy.",
  "because there was a rooster outside and it didn't do what it was supposed to do like normal when the sun comes up.",
  "the rooster is supposed to go or whatever.",
  "but this thing did it at like one and two in the morning it used to drive me nuts.",
  "so i used to always wake up at two because i'd hear this rooster going and i just wanted to kill that bird.",
  "did you go back to sleep after that.",
  "yeah of course i went back to sleep.",
  "but the bird would wake me up regularly.",
  "yeah no roosters here.",
