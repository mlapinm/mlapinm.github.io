  "the grateful elephant.",
  "a long time ago in the kingdom of bodhisatta.",
  "there was a village where there lived 500 carpenters.",
  "these carpenters would go to the jungle.",
  "adjoining their village to collect wood.",
  "carry it back to their village to fashion planks out of it for homes furniture and other things.",
  "one day as they were working in the jungle they heard a loud yelp.",
  "what a heart-wrenching scream.",
  "it is coming from that direction.",
  "the carpenters ran in the direction of the sound.",
  "from behind the trees out came a massive majestic elephant.",
  "but the elephant was in tears.",
  "the villagers noticed that the creature was limping.",
  "hesitating they went towards him.",
  "the elephant turned it's one of its feet.",
  "such that the carpenters saw that this foot was badly swollen.",
  "they looked closely.",
  "there was a splinter stuck in the foot.",
  "you must be in such pain.",
  "we have to pull it out.",
  "carefully the villagers pulled out the splinter.",
  "cleaned the wound with warm water.",
  "and bandaged it carefully.",
  "so that it would heal well.",
  "within a few days the carpenters decided to the elephant's wound healed completely.",
  "the elephant was so grateful.",
  "these good men have saved my life.",
  "i too must serve them as a mark of my gratitude.",

  "from that day the elephant began helping the carpenters.",
  "he would transport the heavy logs.",
  "carry their tools help in moving their loaded parts.",
  "the elephant made the work of the carpenters so much easier.",
  "in return the carpenters fed the elephant well.",
  "they would each bring a portion of fruit for their tusk friend.",
  "such that every day the elephant had 500 portions of food for himself.",
  "soon a son was born to the elephant.",
  "while he helped humans with the lumbering.",
  "the son helped them in planting more trees.",
  "ah thank you buddy.",
  "planting trees is far more important than filling them for if we did not do this.",
  "not only would we exhaust all the wood from the forest.",
  "we would also ruin the weather and climate of this world.",
  "i am done here for now.",
  "so you too take some rest and go play.",
  "go.",
  "friend your son is adorable.",
  "our children simply love him.",
  "both of you are such a great blessing in our lives.",
  "time went by the elephant became old.",
  "father this is the fifth night this week.",
  "that you were in such terrible pain.",
  "why do you pick such heavy logs.",
  "when it hurts your back so much.",
  "because the humans are my friends.",
  "long ago they had saved my life.",
  "and in all these years haven't you seen how lovingly they have continued to look after us.",
  "i have to help them my son.",
  "it is my duty.",
  "father then let me do it from now on.",
  "i do love our human friends.",
  "but i am not going to let you wreak havoc with your body for them.",
  "it is decided that from now on i shall take your place in helping the humans.",
  "but son i am young i am strong.",
  "i will take your place from now on and that is final.",
  "so from the next day the elephant's son started helping the carpenters in their work.",
  "one day the king of the land king brahmadata happened to pass by the forest.",
  "from a distance he saw the young strong elephant work with the carpenters.",
  "as though they were all a team.",
  "the king at once fell in love with the beast.",
  "he went towards the carpenters.",
  "hello my man.",
  "your highness.",
  "what an honor your your majesty.",
  "please come.",
  "the king was made to sit on a special rock.",
  "and the elephant was asked to fetch a pail of fresh water from the river.",
  "just as the humans stood respectfully before the king.",
  "the elephant too stood raising his trunk before the king.",
  "the king went up to the elephant.",
  "and stroked him lovingly.",
  "the elephant too stroked the king.",
  "as though he were a long lost friend.",
  "what a beautiful majestic creature.",
  "is he your friend.",

  "so even though with great sadness.",
  "the carpenters and the elephant let their friend and son go.",
  "the elephant too had tears in his eyes.",
  "as he left his father and human friends.",
  "to go with the king.",
  "to king brahmadata the elephant was not just another creature in his army.",
  "but rather a brother a friend.",
  "the king himself taught him the art of fighting.",
  "he had grand jewels made for the elephant.",
  "had a chamber built with him right outside his own royal chambers.",

  "and look after my kingdom.",
  "and my family in my absence.",
  "will you do that.",
  "i will do all that it takes to protect our motherland.",
  "but please come back soon master.",
  "all the courtiers standing nearby heard the king.",
  "no an elephant will look after the kingdom.",
  "love and loyalty are extremely powerful things my friends.",
  "and no human being can match the love and loyalty of an animal.",
  "you will see when the time comes.",
  "the bond that the king and the elephant.",
  "share will prove invaluable for this kingdom.",
  "many months passed by.",
  "nothing was heard of king brahmadatta.",

  "one day they got news that king brahmadata had been last seen near a terrible jungle where no man had ever been known to get out alive.",
  "the commander went to the queen to give her the sad news.",
  "the queen was with the elephant at the time.",
  "why do all of you look so somber.",
  "your highness.",

  "in the absence of the king they loved.",
  "the podesta soldiers could not fight.",
  "the army started losing the battle.",
  "sire if we don't do something now we shall lose the battle.",
  "we must inform the queen.",
  "the commander told the queen of how mandana mishra's armies were defeating them.",
  "we have only one hope.",
  "come with me.",
  "the queen went to see the elephant.",
  "who had still not eaten.",
  "and was lying in a.",

  "brother king brahmadata.",
  "you cannot keep lying like this friend.",
  "you can't your beloved king had asked.",
  "you to be the protector of our kingdom.",
  "he is the son of your king.",
  "you decide are you going to lie there lamenting as the prince is killed.",

  "i shall go into the battle myself.",
  "the elephant stepped into the war.",
  "and fought like a true warrior his tenacious.",
  "resolute trumpets infused new hope.",
  "new passion in bodhisattva's army.",
  "and within no time mandana mishra's armies were defeated.",
  "don't you dare think that the prince of this land is young and that bodhisattva has no protector.",
  "i told you love and loyalty are extremely powerful things.",

  "oh you mouse.",
  "why are you stealing my food.",
  "i'm a homeless man.",
  "go steal from the richer people.",
  "they won't even notice it.",

  "so he goes to knock on their door.",
  "good sir it's getting dark and i'm new here.",

  "what's your question ma'am.",
  "we have a 16 year old daughter who can't speak.",

  "and he continues his journey.",
  "and sees a sea of mountains that he has to cross.",

  "1 000 years is a long time.",
  "he deserves to go to heaven now.",
  "at last he thought about the young girl.",

  "and buddha as expected answered.",
  "the turtle is unwilling to leave the shell.",
  "as long as he is unwilling to leave the comfort of his shell.",
