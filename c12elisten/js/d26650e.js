  "once upon a time there was a flower fairy who ruled a beautiful kingdom called minnesota.",
  "that is why the kingdom was full of beautiful blooming flowers.",
  "in a peaceful village inside a kingdom there was a poor farmer named rosa.",
  "who was very beautiful gentle and kind.",
  "she loved to plant flowers and play with birds.",
  "in her spare time she often went to the flower field in the village and took care of the birds.",
  "in her garden she also planted all kinds of flowers and took care of them very well.",
  "rosa had a neighbor whose name was melanie an evil witch.",
  "because she always disguised herself to look normal.",
  "no one knew that she was a witch.",
  "in contrast to rosa she was very cunning and cruel.",
  "she had a snake head shaped stick which was always with her.",
  "she often consulted it and it often told her to do bad things.",
  "melanie also loved planting flowers.",
  "oh my beautiful flowers.",
  "but her flowers were always withered and never looked fresh.",
  "she looked at her neighbor's beautiful garden.",
  "she was very jealous and angry because rosa was more beautiful than her.",
  "and her garden was also very beautiful.",
  "one day a beautiful and colorful bird flew to the witch's garden.",
  "it sang some beautiful songs to welcome the spring.",
  "but unfortunately its songs accidentally walk the wicked witch melanie up.",
  "this annoying bird ruined my sleep.",
  "melanie angrily took the snake stick heading to the garden.",
  "as soon as she found the bird.",
  "she swung her stick up a cloud of smoke straight towards the bird and swept it away.",
  "the beautiful bird fell on the side of rosa's garden making the witch very satisfied.",
  "at that moment rosa returned home and saw everything.",
  "oh poor you bird go with me i will bandage your wounds for you.",
  "thanks to rosa's care the beautiful bird quickly recovered.",
  "the bird was very happy and felt grateful to her.",
  "when you feel better i'll bring you back to the forest.",
  "suddenly the bird transformed into a beautiful fairy.",
  "i am a flower fairy each year i turned into a bird for one day.",
  "but when i got here i was injured.",
  "fortunately you saved me and took care of me.",
  "i want to repay you.",
  "rosa what do you wish for.",
  "you're a flower fairy can you give me lots of precious flowers from around the world.",
  "that is simple the fairy raised her magic wand.",
  "immediately a beam of light flew around rosa.",
  "i will give you my power.",
  "now all the flowers you plant will grow up really fast.",
  "you can also save the withered flowers.",
  "i will ask the birds to bring you lots of valuable flower seeds.",
  "that's great thank you so much.",
  "the fairy flower disappeared.",
  "since then every few days the birds brought valuable flower seeds from around the world to rosa for her to plant them.",
  "thanks to that rosa had a beautiful flower garden full of colors from the precious flowers that no one in that kingdom had.",
  "rosa happily shared some beautiful flowers with the.",
  "people around her.",
  "that's why people always liked her.",
  "there's a judge in that kingdom who also liked flowers.",
  "he often passed by rose's house and admired her beautiful garden.",
  "my god i've never seen such a wonderful flower garden before.",
  "i also have many kinds of seeds.",
  "but why don't i have such beautiful flowers.",
  "knowing that he light flowers.",
  "rosa gave him a basket of flowers.",
  "the birds brought the flower seeds from everywhere in the world here for me.",
  "unbelievable is it true.",
  "but when he personally saw the birds bringing the seeds to rosa.",
  "the judge believed what she said.",
  "rosa became more and more beautiful and everyone loved her.",
  "seeing that the witch melanie was very jealous and hated her.",
  "rose's flower garden is always beautiful and colorful.",
  "and your garden is always withered just like you.",
  "shut up you don't know anything.",
  "now i'll destroy her garden.",
  "immediately she created a storm to sweep through rosa's garden and destroyed all the flowers.",
  "oh my beautiful flowers [Laughter].",
  "now let's see how beautiful your garden is.",
  "rosa desperately looked at the garden.",
  "she was very sad and cried for the flowers.",
  "magically her tears fell onto the flowers and made them grow back beautifully as before.",
  "it was one of the powers the flower fairy had given to her.",
  "melanie was so confused and angry about that.",
  "that's strange why does her garden still look normal.",
  "rosa was given the magic by the flower fairy.",
  "she can always make the flowers fresh and beautiful.",
  "flower fairy now i must go and see what other magic she has.",
  "the witch secretly went to rosa's garden to observe.",
  "however when approaching the flowers the flowers told each other to use their phones to hurt her.",
  "you're so sneaky and useless.",
  "you're laughing at me.",
  "quickly think of a way to harm her for me.",
  "or else i'll burn you up.",
  "easy make everyone believe rosa is a witch.",
  "you won't need to do anything people will help you handle her.",
  "good idea but how do I do that.",
  "rosa often goes to the flower field in the village.",

  "this rumor spread quickly throughout the kingdom.",
  "causing people to gossip.",
  "the rumor was also told in many different mysterious stories.",
  "that made it hard for people to focus on working.",
  "it was so serious that the king had to offer prince bernard to go and investigate.",
  "when he arrived at the flower field where the rumors started.",

  "rosa happily looked at the beautiful flowers and smiled under the sun.",
  "that made her beauty become even more and more beautiful.",
  "prince bernard was attracted because he had never seen such a beautiful girl.",

  "i am a flower fairy.",
  "i did give rosa that power.",
  "a flower fairy can you prove what you said is true.",
  "okay look here the fairy flower used her magic to make a lot of beautiful flowers grow up on the ground.",
  "a lot of birds also flew there because of the flowers.",
  "all of these created a wonderful scene.",
  "now everyone must believe that she was a flower fairy.",
  "an evil witch can never make the flowers grow.",
  "but only make them withered away.",
  "and melanie is the real witch.",
