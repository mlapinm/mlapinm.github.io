  "Human beings are programmed to be afraid of things that can hurt them.",
  "Show a baby a picture of a snake or a big poisonous spider and the baby will show fear it's in our dna.",
  "We are all afraid of some things and that's good but a phobia causes absolute terror with physical symptoms such as a racing heart sickness and panic attacks.",
  "Phobias are usually the result of a bad experience.",
  "For example a car crash can cause a fear of driving but it's often just of ordinary things like balloons or a particular food.",
  "Some people are more likely to get phobias than others.",
  "It's in their genes.",
  "My job is to train people to conquer their phobia.",
  "First we just talk about it and help the patient relax.",
  "Then we might show just a picture of their phobia.",
  "After that we sometimes show a movie and finally we ask them to touch the object.",
  "In this way phobias can normally be treated in just three or four sessions."
