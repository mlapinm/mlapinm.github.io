  "I have a really unusual phobia it began when I was a little girl.",
  "I was staying with my grandmother and she asked me to go upstairs and get her cardigan sweater.",
  "I opened the cabinet and saw this big dark green sweater with huge black buttons hanging there.",
  "I was terrified.",
  "I started screaming.",
  "My grandmother rushed upstairs and finally managed to calm me down but from then on it was a problem.",
  "It was the buttons.",
  "All buttons made me feel uncomfortable.",
  "It's difficult for me to buy clothes.",
  "I try to find skirts and pants with just belts and zippers but it's not easy.",
  "About a year ago a button came off a colleague's jacket at work and I had a panic attack.",
  "I've decided to see a therapist but I'm embarrassed to say I'm scared of buttons.",
  "It sounds silly."
