  "Lucky cat.",
  "If the other boys hadn’t come.",
  "she would have lost the fight.",
  "She should have just run away.",
  "instead of fighting with such a big dog.",
  "She was bound to lose against a dog.",
  "I don’t think so Tofu.",
  "Dogs are more powerful than cats, Tia.",
  "Maybe so.",
  "But when you have courage and fight with intelligence.",
  "you can win against anyone.",
  "Once in the heart of a thick jungle lived a little boy called Mowgli.",
  "He did not belong to the jungle.",
  "as he was a human child.",
  "Yet, he grew up with a family of wolves.",
  "His mother, Raksha cared for him as she cared for her other pups.",
  "Careful Mowgli, or you’ll fall off the ridge!.",
  "No ma! I won’t! See you later!.",
  "And so Mowgli took off into the jungle to find his friend and teacher Bagheera.",
  "When Mowgli had been a small baby.",
  "no more than a year old, he had been found.",
  "and saved from the forest fire by Bagheera.",
  "Of course no body knew who Mowgli was.",
  "but they always believed he came from the man village.",
  "at the outskirts of the jungle.",
  "Bagheera had handed over Mowgli to the wolves.",
  "so that he could have a family to grow up with.",
  "Since then Mowgli had learned the ways of the jungle from his family.",
  "and his friends Bagheera and Baloo.",
  "He ran like them.",
  "hunted like them.",
  "climbed trees like them.",
  "and also spoke like them.",
  "Hello Bagheera! What are you going to teach me today?.",
  "I won’t be teaching you today.",
  "Today, Baloo has something planned for you.",
  "Let’s go fishing in the river.",
  "Hello Baloo! Let me get a stick to make a spear for fishing.",
  "You don’t need a spear to fish.",
  "But it makes it easier.",
  "You can’t do it like that Mowgli.",
  "That is not our way.",
  "Then how is it that I know how to make a spear Baloo?.",
  "Who taught me that?.",
  "As usual Bagheera and Baloo did not have an answer to Mowgli’s questions.",
  "The forest fire had started and destroyed the man village.",
  "And nobody lived there for a long time.",
  "Bagheera had tried many times to find someone to return the child to.",
  "but no one was there.",
  "When the village settled again, the men put sharp barbed wire fences.",
  "and laid traps to keep the animals at bay.",
  "Although, the animals couldn’t understand why.",
  "All creatures of the jungle had always maintained a safe distance from the humans.",
  "They never meant any harm to them.",
  "In any case, the fences and traps made it impossible for Bagheera.",
  "to return the child back to the human world.",
  "Okay… we will do it without a spear. Let’s go.",
  "The trio set off to the riverbank.",
  "where, Baloo showed Mowgli how to catch fish without a spear.",
  "Baloo would swiftly duck his head into the water and come out with fish in his mouth.",
  "Mowgli gave it several tries.",
  "before he was successful.",
  "The day passed in the lesson and they decided to head back to the wolf pack.",
  "They had almost reached home when Bagheera alerted the other two.",
  "There was someone in the bushes ahead in the far right.",
  "Soon the others could see a pair of fierce eyes with a scar.",
  "that ran across the left one.",
  "emerging from the bushes.",
  "Then the whole figure stepped ahead.",
  "Run Mowgli! Run!.",
  "Immediately Baloo and Mowgli took off towards home.",
  "leaving Bagheera to fight the large villainous tiger, Sherkhan.",
  "Bagheera and Sherkhan immediately leapt at each other.",
  "Sherkhan hadn’t expected Bagheera to be so strong.",
  "and was taken by surprise.",
  "when he managed to throw Sherkhan against a large tree.",
  "The elders of wolf pack soon joined them.",
  "Sherkhan knew he was injured and outnumbered.",
  "You might have saved him today.",
  "But the human belongs to me. I will come back for him!.",
  "Sherkhan!.",
  "What are you doing here! This is not your territory.",
  "No territory can keep me out.",
  "And the next time I come.",
  "I will not spare anyone who stands in my way!.",
  "The jungle knew that Sherkhan’s threats were not to be taken lightly.",
  "And soon worry spread in the wolf pack regarding Mowgli’s stay.",
  "and the pack’s future.",
  "I can defend myself.",
  "I will not let any harm come to my family and friends.",
  "I know a way to put an end to this.",
  "Mowgli gathered Bagheera and Baloo.",
  "I know how I came to the jungle!.",
  "I have seen Sherkhan’s eyes only one time before in my life.",
  "He had attacked our village when I was small.",
  "To scare him, the elders used to fire.",
  "but he took me and escaped.",
  "and the whole village caught fire.",
  "When my father followed him to save me, he killed my father.",
  "That is why the villagers have put traps and fences now.",
  "Yes, but now we will stop Sherkhan forever!.",
  "We know where he sleeps in the day.",
  "at the foot of the small mountain on the other side of the river.",
  "The bulls feed on the grassy slopes of that mountain.",
  "If we can scare them to run down the mountain, Sherkhan won’t stand a chance.",
  "That is a good plan Mowgli.",
  "The trio assured the others that they had found a way-out of their troubles.",
  "And by tomorrow night, all will be fine.",
  "Early next morning, the three set off for the mountain.",
  "They went around it and climbed it from the other side.",
  "so that no one could see them coming.",
  "Once on top of it, they could see the bulls eating the grass.",
  "The three leapt at the quiet bulls and rushed towards them screaming so loudly.",
  "that the bulls got scared and started running down the hill to escape from them.",
  "The plan was working!.",
  "The whole mountainside shook and rumbled under the stamping of the bulls.",
  "This woke up Sharekhan. He saw the bulls rushing towards him.",
  "There were scores of them. Scared, he started running away from them.",
  "He is trying to get away!.",
  "I won’t let him!.",
  "Mowgli took to the tress and swung himself from branches of one tree to another.",
  "On the other side Sherkhan couldn’t keep ahead of the bulls.",
  "Their sharp horns poked him and he got trampled under their feet.",
  "One would have died.",
  "But Sherkhan wasn’t an ordinary tiger.",
  "He was evil and trickery was his second nature.",
  "He latched onto the horns of one bull and tugged at him.",
  "Agitated, the bull threw him aside and over the side of the plateau!.",
  "Sherkhan held to the edges of the plateau and started climbing up.",
  "He had almost made it when a small tree trunk hit him in the face.",
  "He lost his grip and fell to his death.",
  "It was Mowgli.",
  "He had reached the spot and found a small tree uprooted by the bull's stampede.",
  "With his quick thinking, he had thrown Sherkhan to his end.",
  "He had saved himself and protected the entire jungle from the tyranny of this villain.",
  "Bagheera, Baloo and Mowgli returned to the wolf pack.",
  "where everyone rejoiced on hearing what had happened.",
  "So you see Tofu.",
  "to win, you don’t always have to be the strongest.",
  "If you have courage and think intelligently.",
  "you can win against anyone!.",
  "Yes Tia! Now I understand what you meant!.",
  "Shall we go down and play with our friends now?.",
  "Yes! Let’s go!."
