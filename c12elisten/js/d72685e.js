  "in this video.",
  "we're going to go over five beginners mistakes.",
  "and how to fix them.",
  "i'm katie and you're watching skatey.",
  "Mistake 1 - Penguin.",
  "it's all right my penguin friend is okay.",
  "when beginners are learning sometimes.",
  "they keep their weight too central.",
  "and don't transfer the weight to each foot.",
  "which kind of creates this motion.",
  "so when i'm teaching the children.",
  "i always say to them.",
  "oh don't do the penguin which is this.",
  "so it's a really good way to remember.",
  "not to do that move.",
  "so a good way to fix it.",
  "is to start marching because if you're going to lift the foot.",
  "you have to transfer your weight.",
  "and this helps to get rid.",
  "of my friend over here.",
  "Mistake 2 - Stopping.",
  "one thing that a lot of beginners struggle with.",
  "when they're starting out is stopping.",
  "because you're learning.",
  "and you're getting going.",
  "and all of a sudden you're like.",
  "i don't stop.",
  "so the instinct is to use the toe stop.",
  "or just throw yourself on the ground that works too.",
  "but the instinct is to try and use your toe stop.",
  "but you put it behind you and it bounces.",
  "it hurts your toes it's really uncomfortable.",
  "but a really easy way to fix.",
  "it is to just turn your toe out.",
  "because then that means.",
  "you're going to use more of the flat of the toe stop.",
  "i'll show you what i mean moving.",
  "so you see my foot's bouncing along behind me.",
  "and it's hurting my toes.",
  "it's really uncomfortable.",
  "so with this one keep your foot close.",
  "and turn your toe out.",
  "so you're making this t position.",
  "and i'll show you how to do it.",
  "so keep your foot closed turn your toe out.",
  "now the key to this is to apply very little pressure.",
  "and as you start to slow to apply more pressure.",
  "and that will control the stop.",
  "and make it a much more comfortable experience.",
  "Mistake 3 - Walking.",
  "so when people first put on a pair of skates.",
  "the natural instinct.",
  "is to basically try and walk in them.",
  "so you're doing this motion.",
  "obviously you're not going to get anywhere.",
  "so to counteract that people.",
  "then put the toe stop in.",
  "so then you're doing this.",
  "but with roller skating the push needs to come from the instep.",
  "of the back foot so this bit here.",
  "so your foot's turned out and you push like that.",
  "so then the push comes from the instep.",
  "so you have to turn your foot out to get the push.",
  "and that's how you get lots of speed.",
  "Mistake 4 - Posture.",
  "when you're first learning anything.",
  "it's natural to want to look at what's happening.",
  "i mean that's perfectly normal.",
  "but with skating if you're looking down at your feet.",
  "your weight's too far forward.",
  "and also everyone says it bend your knees.",
  "but the easiest way to think of a knee bend.",
  "is to think about having the knee over your toe.",
  "so that's how bent you've got to be.",
  "so you need to be here.",
  "so when i look down my knees and toes are kind of in line.",
  "and that's how bent you need to be.",
  "don't go too straight.",
  "i'm not talking really straight.",
  "but also don't bend forward and look down.",
  "so you kind of want to be in this position.",
  "so when you're skating.",
  "you want to be looking where you're going.",
  "so you need to be looking ahead of you.",
  "so you can prepare for anything that's coming up.",
  "specifically when you're outside.",
  "you want to be scanning.",
  "the ground in front of you for twigs obstacles stones.",
  "because everyone knows.",
  "that stones are a skater's nemesis.",
  "also when you're at the rink.",
  "because little children come from nowhere.",
  "so if you can keep a good look of what's happening around you.",
  "it will help you from falling over.",
  "Mistake 5 - Skate Size.",
  "one of the biggest mistakes.",
  "that new skaters make is getting their skates too big.",
  "and it's one of the worst things you can do.",
  "because it can really put you off.",
  "because having a two big escape can be really hard.",
  "i know you've waited like three weeks for these skates to turn up.",
  "and you're so excited you open the box.",
  "you put the money like.",
  "oh they're a bit big.",
  "i'll put the thick sock on it will be all right.",
  "the problem is.",
  "is that the weight will be in the wrong place.",
  "so you have your main pressure points.",
  "so when you lean back.",
  "you've got a pressure point over your heel.",
  "and when you lean forward.",
  "you've got a pressure point.",
  "which is the ball of your foot.",
  "and you want the trucks to be underneath.",
  "those when you're skating.",
  "so when you've got your skate on.",
  "those pressure points are over.",
  "your front and back truck.",
  "so do an extreme version.",
  "so that's over my back truck.",
  "and that's over my front truck.",
  "but because of that it gives me the maneuverability.",
  "so you can imagine.",
  "if your weight's behind that front truck.",
  "it's going to be really hard you'll almost have to go.",
  "past the ball of your foot onto your toes.",
  "which is a really unnatural position.",
  "and it's going to make it really hard to balance.",
  "so if you get the correct size.",
  "that fits your foot.",
  "it will make all of skating so much easier.",
  "Bye bye.",
  "i hope this video has really helped you to fix just a few minor things.",
  "and to help you on your skating journey.",
  "i'm katie you've been watching skatey.",
  "and i'll see you next time.",
  "bye.",
  "Outtakes.",
  "one thing that a lot of beginners struggle with.",
  "when they're starting then.",
  "okay i don't like that um.",
  "no i'm just gonna.",
  "so you can see what's happening.",
  "i can't say i'm gonna have to use a different word.",
  "because i can't say specifically.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qCL5-0b2Y&list=PLPHb4PtMjk0shrC0nwgRMvWwEDESn8KHc\">because i can't say specifically</a>",
  "in this video we're going to cover four hacks.",
  "which are going to help your roller skating journey.",
  "go smoothly.",
  "i'm katie and you're watching skatey.",
  "Hack 1 - Balance and Rolling.",
  "everything in skating is easier.",
  "if you've got a little bit of roll to your wheels.",
  "so even if you're just doing a snake pattern forwards backwards.",
  "it's always easy if you've got a little.",
  "bit of roll because your wheels will move easier.",
  "it's similar to when you're teaching a child to ride a bike.",
  "so they're pedaling away.",
  "and then before you let go of the back of that saddle.",
  "you give that saddle a shove.",
  "because you know with that bit of speed.",
  "the pedaling is going to be easier to balance.",
  "so it works the same on roller skates.",
  "a good idea to give you a bit of roll is to push off from something.",
  "so you can use anything.",
  "that's around you.",
  "you can use a wall or you could do fountains.",
  "make sure your feet are parallel.",
  "when you push back.",
  "Hack 2 - Where Should My Weight Be?.",
  "one question that gets asked quite a lot.",
  "is where should your weight be on your skate.",
  "so you want your weight over the ball of your foot.",
  "that should then be over your front truck.",
  "which gives you the maneuverability of your skate.",
  "so then you can do turns.",
  "and all sorts of things.",
  "now this is kind of correct for about 90 of the time.",
  "unless you're doing some crazy trick.",
  "and then obviously you're going to have your weight on the back.",
  "or whatever.",
  "but whether you're going forwards.",
  "backwards sideways or if you're going sideways.",
  "you're already in trouble.",
  "especially backwards.",
  "you want that weight on the front.",
  "and i know that might sound a little bit kind of counter-intuitive.",
  "because you're going backwards.",
  "but the idea is that it keeps you weight forward.",
  "which makes it a lot safer for you.",
  "part of your weight is also not looking down.",
  "because as soon as you look down you're.",
  "almost pushing your weight past your toes.",
  "i know i talk about all the time.",
  "do this with your feet.",
  "do that with your feet.",
  "and you want to look at your feet.",
  "i mean that's natural.",
  "but try and look where you're going.",
  "and that will make life a lot easier.",
  "Hack 3 - Controlling A Fall.",
  "another little hack.",
  "that's going to help you.",
  "is to do with falling.",
  "so when you feel this sort of wobble.",
  "don't.",
  "i know the natural thing is the helicopter.",
  "because it just is but.",
  "try and reach forward grab your knees.",
  "grab your ankles go for your feet.",
  "and then what might happen.",
  "it might save the fall.",
  "but if it doesn't the chances are you're going to go forwards to the ground.",
  "rather than backwards and those backward fools.",
  "i know they're not very pleasant.",
  "and they can really come out of nowhere sometimes.",
  "so for falling you want to try.",
  "and keep your body relaxed.",
  "again i know it goes against like every ounce of your being.",
  "but don't tense.",
  "because when you tense up when you fall.",
  "that's when you jar yourself.",
  "and you can hurt your wrists your shoulders.",
  "so don't forget to use the softer bits of your body.",
  "they're very helpful.",
  "and just keep it soft.",
  "so if you're full.",
  "it's more of a fall to the ground.",
  "and not a jar of your body.",
  "and that's when you're going to hurt yourself.",
  "so try and use the bottom.",
  "because it's nice and squidgy.",
  "Hack 4 - Confidence - I'm ok, it's a fake fall!.",
  "can you guess what the next hack is.",
  "safety gear of course.",
  "it's a really good idea to have some safety gears.",
  "when you're learning.",
  "but also when you're more experienced.",
  "i mean i'm the worst person for this.",
  "i'll go out without my safety gear on.",
  "and then when i fall over i think i've left it in the car.",
  "so it's not much good in the car.",
  "so please put it on i'm wearing a three-piece set today.",
  "this is just a size large.",
  "i can put a link to this one in the description bar for you the knee pads.",
  "i can confirm are very good.",
  "i've tried those out a number of times.",
  "and the wrist guards are great.",
  "because they've not only got the metal here.",
  "but they've got the metal on top as well.",
  "and now i'm wearing a skate hut.",
  "helmet.",
  "these are double certified.",
  "and it's really important.",
  "that you get a certified helmet.",
  "because then you know.",
  "that you're safe.",
  "and it's going to protect your head.",
  "the key here is to keep yourself safe.",
  "but it's also to give you confidence.",
  "if i do kind of try something.",
  "that's a little bit out of my comfort zone.",
  "and i do hit the deck.",
  "i'm going to be okay.",
  "i mean you can see.",
  "i've got quite a few scrapes on these.",
  "so they have been used quite well.",
  "what you can do.",
  "is you can obviously protect the soft bits as well.",
  "so you can buy padded shorts.",
  "that have hip protection and protection for your tailbone.",
  "but you can always stick some padding or some foam or a pillow.",
  "down here when your pads do arrive.",
  "try them out.",
  "so it gives you confidence again.",
  "so even without your skates on.",
  "find a nice soft area carpet or a piece of grass.",
  "and try them feel it.",
  "so just fall to your knees.",
  "and that is so that is so much softer.",
  "than if i didn't have these on.",
  "i would not be doing that.",
  "so give them a go and it will really help your confidence.",
  "and then you'll just be away.",
  "Your Skating Journey.",
  "learning to roller skate is a journey.",
  "so everyone learns at different speeds.",
  "so don't compare yourself to everyone else.",
  "i know it's really hard.",
  "but compare yourself to you.",
  "so when you go out.",
  "take a video of yourself.",
  "and then you can look back at it.",
  "in a couple of weeks time.",
  "when you're really frustrated that.",
  "you can't scale i said i give up.",
  "look back at that first video and be like wow.",
  "look how much better i am now.",
  "so you always need to keep perspective.",
  "and just bear in mind.",
  "that you can do it.",
  "it's just going to take a little bit of time.",
  "and a little bit of perseverance.",
  "but you can do it and we'll do the journey together.",
  "See you next time!.",
  "that's been our four hacks.",
  "i hope that these have really helped you to progress in your skating journey.",
  "and now a shameless plug of my fabulous t-shirt that i'm wearing.",
  "if you two would like one of these as a link in the description below.",
  "i'm katie and you've been watching.",
  "skatey.",
  "and i'll see you next time.",
  "bye.",
  "the great thing.",
  "so when your pads do arrive.",
  "test the map there's a train.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHI8BBKVVgg&list=PLPHb4PtMjk0shrC0nwgRMvWwEDESn8KHc&index=6\">test the map there's a train</a>",
  "Intro.",
  "toe stops.",
  "Toe Stop Drill.",
  "so when you're skating.",
  "it's really good idea.",
  "to know where your toe stops are.",
  "now this sounds really silly i know.",
  "but it's a muscle memory thing.",
  "so a really good way to do this is to go up and down.",
  "like this so initially.",
  "it's best to do one than the other.",
  "but when you get used to it you can do two together.",
  "so we're back here again at our lamppost friend.",
  "i really feel that the lamppost is becoming quite a major feature now.",
  "so if you've got any ideas for a name.",
  "let me know.",
  "if you want to hold on to do this.",
  "until you get comfortable that's absolutely fine.",
  "an important thing to note is if you change your wheels.",
  "you may need to just re-muscle memory.",
  "where they are.",
  "because of the size.",
  "some skaters choose to take out their toe stops.",
  "and this is because some types of skating.",
  "like rhythm and jam.",
  "the toe stops actually get in the way.",
  "but if you're outside.",
  "i tend to recommend leaving them in.",
  "just because if you get yourself into trouble.",
  "you can use your toe stops to help you.",
  "if you have one of the more popular brands of skates.",
  "that starts with an m and rhymes with roxy.",
  "then they have a nut that holds the toe stop on.",
  "so if you choose to wear a toe guard.",
  "which goes here under the toe stop.",
  "you need to make sure.",
  "that you have plate nut.",
  "then the toe guard and then the stopper.",
  "because if you put the nut against the fabric.",
  "it has a tendency to come undone.",
  "and one of the scariest feelings as a skater.",
  "is if you go for a toe stop.",
  "that isn't there.",
  "it's a real heart stop moment.",
  "so be really careful of that.",
  "at about this time.",
  "i normally say let's try it moving.",
  "Toe Stop Drill Moving - Backwards.",
  "so we're not going to practice this one moving forward.",
  "and i shall show you why.",
  "because it doesn't end well.",
  "but you can do it backwards.",
  "so just the same as we did the drills.",
  "so we're going to do one foot first.",
  "and then we can do the other foot.",
  "and then we're going to do both feet.",
  "all of these drills just really help you.",
  "get used to where your toe stops are.",
  "and it also helps you get more confident on your skates and more comfortable.",
  "Toe Stop Skip.",
  "once you know where your toe stops are.",
  "you can start to have a little bit of fun with it.",
  "so up on two toe stops and then you're just gonna step.",
  "and then bring your feet together and step and together now.",
  "the important part here is to know where they are.",
  "because if you accidentally step and step here.",
  "that's really dangerous.",
  "so you need to make sure.",
  "you're stepping onto your toe stop.",
  "not onto your wheels.",
  "especially that sort of this angle bad.",
  "so definitely onto your toe stops.",
  "so step together step together.",
  "and the better you get.",
  "you can do it like a little skip.",
  "i love this one.",
  "it's really fun.",
  "and you can do it the other way as well.",
  "as with anything you'll probably find one way easier than the other.",
  "it's always the way.",
  "Toe Stop Bunny Hop.",
  "so another fun little step is a progressive forward hop.",
  "so i call it a bunny hop.",
  "so you put the leg in front and then you hop.",
  "so this has to be progressive.",
  "because you've already spoken about how you can't do that.",
  "because it ends badly.",
  "so it's a progressive hop.",
  "so here he is again.",
  "it might be a good idea just to feel it.",
  "static that you're going to progress.",
  "so you're stepping forward.",
  "and it's going up.",
  "and you're progressing.",
  "that's really important.",
  "Backwards Bunny Hop.",
  "so you can also do this little hop.",
  "backwards.",
  "this for backwards please.",
  "so the foot again has to progress.",
  "so you're going to put it back and hop like that.",
  "so let's show you one more time.",
  "so you're going to put the foot in and lift up.",
  "so i'm landing staggered.",
  "because i'm outside.",
  "if i was in a rink i'd probably land with my feet together.",
  "so you can land however you feel the most comfortable.",
  "and as always you can do it on both feet.",
  "so left foot in and down.",
  "Bye Bye.",
  "so that was toe stops.",
  "i hope you had lots of fun with this one.",
  "and remember embrace the safe.",
  "i'll keep working on it.",
  "i'm katie you've been watching skatey.",
  "and i'll see you next time bye.",
  "Outtakes.",
  "so that's totally fine.",
  "and you can replace them with a um.",
  "this sounds really ner."
