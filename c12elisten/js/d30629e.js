  "tofu please finish your breakfast first.",
  "no i want to play first.",
  "i don't like it anyway.",
  "tofu it is not nice to leave your food like that.",
  "you should be thankful to your food and eat it respectfully [Applause].",
  "the first thanksgiving.",
  "this is a very old story.",
  "it is from the year 1620.",
  "when a group of pilgrims came from europe in a ship called the mayflower to the east coast of united states.",
  "we have reached this new land and we shall make it our home now.",
  "let us call it plymouth.",
  "yes.",
  "and this big rock by which plymouth is recognized will be called the plymouth rock.",
  "we shall make a settlement here.",
  "and so the pilgrims got busy trying to make a settlement in their new home.",
  "but they had arrived in the peak of winter with little resources and no food.",
  "oh this is such a difficult winter.",
  "we have almost no food.",
  "the men go and catch whatever fish.",
  "they can find in the freezing lakes.",
  "but it is not always enough.",
  "yes and a sickness has taken over our people.",
  "we have lost so many strong men and women already.",
  "it is very difficult without proper food.",
  "and supplies to take care of them.",
  "yes look at what happened to our brother james chilton and his wife.",
  "they've both died leaving behind little mary chilton.",
  "poor mary she's only 13 years old.",
  "but without her mother and father to take care of her.",
  "we will have to make sure she is safe.",
  "and so mary was taken under the care of all other pilgrims.",
  "but it was a hard sickness and people died from extreme cold lack of food and the sickness that had come over this settlement.",
  "this meant mary had to work hard.",
  "many of the older women amongst the pilgrims had died.",
  "and the remaining work had to be shared by everyone.",
  "mary took care of cooking and laundry for the men and boys whose wives or mothers had died.",
  "then one day in march two strangers called samoset and squanto visited the settlement.",
  "they were native indians who lived on the land.",
  "hello settlers.",
  "welcome to your new home.",
  "thank you who are you.",
  "i am samuset.",
  "i am the leader of the abhinaki people.",
  "and this is squanto from the wampanoag tribe.",
  "hello samusatan squanto.",
  "how is it that you speak such good english.",
  "i have had experience with other settlers who know english.",
  "we see that we are having trouble with food.",
  "squanto here can teach you how to grow food on this soil.",
  "and so the pilgrims made new friends and learnt how to grow food in the new home.",
  "they learnt that using fish as fertilizers will help their crops grow better.",
  "with the help of squanto and the other people of his tribe.",
  "the pilgrims grew a healthy crop of beans pumpkins and corns.",
  "to celebrate the harvest the pilgrims invited king massa saud of the wampanoag tribe to the feast.",
  "king massasoit's men helped the settlers hunt for the feast.",
  "and large feast of corn roasted meat by fruits was laid.",
  "the pilgrims dedicated this day to getting together with friends and family.",
  "and thanking god for the abundance of good food.",
  "and loving people in our lives.",
  "i get it now tia we should be thankful for the abundance of food we have.",
  "i shall respectfully eat whatever is served to me.",
  "that is so wonderful tofu i am proud of you  [Applause]  hi tia.",
  "hi tofu how was school.",

  "and there were so many ideas going about.",
  "it was a lot of fun.",
  "halloween party wow tia.",
  "that sounds like fun.",
  "i love halloween.",
  "it was so nice of someone to invent a day for wearing costumes and collecting treats.",
  "is that why you think we celebrate halloween.",
  "you mean to say that's not why we celebrate halloween.",
  "then why do we celebrate it.",
  "yes tofu there is a lot more to halloween than just the scary stories and trick or treating.",
  "let me tell you a bit of history behind halloween's day.",
  "hundreds of years ago the celtic people of the celts lived in regions that are now ireland britain and northern france.",
  "this was long long back even before jesus christ.",
  "the celts had a tradition of remembering those who had died.",
  "and keeping the evil spirits peaceful.",
  "they did this every year on 31st october and it was called sovereign.",
  "but their practices were opposed to the christian way.",
  "hence nearly 700 years after christ the head of the catholic church moved an important christian day.",
  "the all saints day to 1st november.",
  "he thought everyone would forget about sarwin.",
  "all saints day what is that tia.",
  "it is a christian festival in honor of all the saints in heaven.",
  "earlier it was celebrated on first of may.",
  "did it work the shifting of the festival.",
  "well no it didn't work.",
  "people didn't forget about some hay.",
  "though it didn't spread as fast as it used to earlier.",
  "but tia how did halloween come about.",
  "since november 1st was the day of celebrating the holy spirits.",
  "the evening before that became the holy evening or all hallow even.",
  "hallow is the old word for holy.",
  "and even is the old word for evening.",
  "soon all hallow even became halloween.",
  "so it has nothing to do with dressing up.",
  "it does tofu.",
  "in fact dressing up as spirits and ghosts became a part of the all saints.",
  "day celebration.",
  "because people who celebrated samhain believed that wearing scary costumes would scare away the evil spirits and keep them away.",
  "just like the pumpkin you love to carve every halloween.",
  "oh no no the jack-o-lantern too.",
  "yes tofu people carve the pumpkin.",
  "and keep it outside their homes to ward off the evil spirits.",
  "wow tia i never knew halloween had such a different meaning.",
  "thank you for telling me all this.",
  "come on now let's go home.",
  "and i will help you find a really scary theme for your halloween party."
