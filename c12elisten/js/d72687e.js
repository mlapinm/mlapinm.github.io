  "in this video we're going to cover everything.",
  "you need to know about skating forwards.",
  "i'm katie and you're watching skatey.",
  "the most important thing is to get you moving for the first time.",
  "i showed a really good way.",
  "of getting you moving in a previous video.",
  "where we start with snake pattern.",
  "when we go to marching.",
  "which then gets us to stroke skating.",
  "so have a look at that video.",
  "we're going to put a link to that for you.",
  "the only thing i will mention is that snake pattern isn't for everyone.",
  "so i'm going to show you an alternative to snake pattern.",
  "which some people might find a bit easier.",
  "Alternative to Snake.",
  "the alternative to snake pattern.",
  "because snake pattern isn't for everybody.",
  "so it's essentially the same.",
  "as the snake but we're going to use one foot.",
  "so if you imagine a skier going down a slalom.",
  "this is the sort of action.",
  "we're going to be creating.",
  "so i'll show you how to do it.",
  "so what we're going to do.",
  "is we're going to do essentially a snake pattern on one foot.",
  "but we're going to put all the pressure on your instep.",
  "and your big toe and make a semi-circle.",
  "and then you're going to do the same again and again.",
  "there we go so all your weight is on the inside of your skate.",
  "and then from here you can do the marching.",
  "with your feet turned out the same as before.",
  "Body Positions.",
  "a quick reminder about our body positions.",
  "so you've got your center line.",
  "you want to keep everything balanced.",
  "and you want to bend your knees.",
  "keep the shoulders square.",
  "and your arms out for balance.",
  "Balance.",
  "there are a few tricks that i can show you.",
  "to help you improve your balance now.",
  "the first one.",
  "is balancing on one foot.",
  "so whether you're going from a snake pattern.",
  "or from stroke skating.",
  "you're going to keep your weight central.",
  "get some speed up.",
  "and then you're gonna hold.",
  "arms out shoulders straight that's it.",
  "and don't forget to do it on both feet.",
  "and count to five if you can.",
  "now the more you do this.",
  "the better your stroke skating is going to be.",
  "and also it's going to be easier to stop.",
  "so practice practice practice.",
  "and everything will come together.",
  "Wobbles.",
  "another trick to help you with your balance.",
  "is when you feel a wobble.",
  "a really good way of doing it.",
  "is to almost do it intentionally.",
  "so if you're standing still.",
  "intentionally lean forward.",
  "touch your toes or touch your knees.",
  "and feel it.",
  "feel the weight shift.",
  "and that will help you to deal with the wobbles.",
  "also you can practice this moving.",
  "so to practice it moving you can either go.",
  "from a snake pattern or you're stroke skating.",
  "balance soft knees.",
  "this should really help control this sort of wobble.",
  "T Push.",
  "lots of people talk about t push.",
  "and this is great because you've got this back foot here turned out.",
  "to give you a push.",
  "but it's really hard to get going from that.",
  "so what i say.",
  "is do your snake or your slalom.",
  "and get a bit of speed.",
  "and then once you start stroke skating.",
  "you're going to turn this back foot out.",
  "and that is what's going to give you.",
  "all your speed.",
  "Crossovers.",
  "the best way of cornering is the crossovers.",
  "which are a great way to get you around a corner.",
  "they can also help you to gain lots of speed.",
  "and it's basically where you put the one foot over the other.",
  "the one thing with this is you need to be careful.",
  "is to not get your wheels locked inside each other.",
  "but i will show you what i mean.",
  "and the safe way to do it.",
  "a crossover you need to think of it as putting one foot in front.",
  "so this foot that's on the outside goes in front.",
  "and then this foot goes beside.",
  "now you need to be really careful.",
  "that when you bring this foot through.",
  "it comes through close to the skate.",
  "and in front together.",
  "you don't want this foot to swing out.",
  "because it's going to knock you off a balance.",
  "so we're going to do through in front together.",
  "in through in front together.",
  "now you want your arms facing into the circle.",
  "so if you imagine there's an imaginary circle.",
  "your arms are going to be on the circle.",
  "and remember our pushing.",
  "so we push in front together.",
  "push in front together.",
  "push in front together.",
  "you need to make sure that this foot always goes in front.",
  "not the side.",
  "because that's when you get your wheels locked together.",
  "and we're practicing falling again.",
  "arms knees soft.",
  "push front together.",
  "Extra Push.",
  "there's a little trick with crossovers.",
  "where you can get an extra push.",
  "so i'm going to show you the extra push.",
  "so we do the same as before.",
  "and we cross here.",
  "but when we lift this foot.",
  "we're going to do that.",
  "and push let me show you.",
  "so push cross push.",
  "together.",
  "push cross and then push that foot away.",
  "push push push push.",
  "push.",
  "that way you're gonna get so fast.",
  "it's gonna be great fun.",
  "Cruising.",
  "now this is my favorite bit of skating.",
  "cruising.",
  "so you've got your earbuds in.",
  "you've got your balance.",
  "you've got your speed.",
  "you've got your slalom going.",
  "you've got your crossovers.",
  "and this is where you can really relax.",
  "and just have a great skate.",
  "and just enjoy yourself.",
  "so this is where it all starts to come together.",
  "so i'm going to do a couple of crosses here.",
  "then a couple in this direction.",
  "then a slalom.",
  "and a one foot hold.",
  "and you're happy rolling.",
  "another thing to mention with cruising.",
  "is that the constant stroke skating.",
  "can get really tiring.",
  "so what i do is i sit on my hips.",
  "so you know when you kind of stand like this.",
  "and you slouch you feel your body sit on your hips.",
  "so i do the same thing when i'm skating.",
  "so i'll sit back on one hip.",
  "and then i'll just kind of wiggle my feet.",
  "so you're still moving.",
  "but it takes a lot less effort.",
  "so rather than stroke skating like this.",
  "for a really long time it can get very tiring.",
  "so what i tend to do is.",
  "i sit back on my hips.",
  "and then you can just kind of wiggle.",
  "and it's so much easier.",
  "and much more relaxing.",
  "i hope this video has really helped to improve your forward skating.",
  "giving you some more confidence.",
  "and some more speed.",
  "i'll see you next time.",
  "happy rolling.",
  "one thing that's going to massively help your skating.",
  "is to get some.",
  "as a bug.",
  "if you imagine you're on a bike.",
  "bike.",
  "so forwards we've done wheaton.",
  "we tried to get i think i'm under.",
  "pressure this time because the first one.",
  "was really good.",
  "and now i'm just like oh god okay.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7MLviMbw6A&list=PLPHb4PtMjk0shrC0nwgRMvWwEDESn8KHc\">and now i'm just like oh god okay</a>",
  "Intro.",
  "in this video i'm going to show you how to do this.",
  "i'm katie and you're watching skatey.",
  "Beginner Tips.",
  "before we start moving backwards.",
  "there's just a couple of bits i need to go over.",
  "so obviously you need to be able to skate forwards first.",
  "sounds kind of obvious.",
  "but it's a good place to start.",
  "the weight still needs to be over the ball of your foot.",
  "i know it might sound a little bit different.",
  "because obviously.",
  "we're going backwards.",
  "but you want to stop these falls.",
  "so definitely keep your weight on the ball of your foot.",
  "when you're skating backwards.",
  "the push comes from your instep.",
  "so it's sort of here on this bit here.",
  "when you push.",
  "so that's where you get your push from.",
  "and i also need to show you how to look backwards.",
  "probably been doing this most of your life.",
  "but on the skates it's slightly different.",
  "so when you skate backwards.",
  "you want to turn your shoulders.",
  "and open up.",
  "so you're looking behind you.",
  "now everybody will have a preference on.",
  "which side you look i like to look over my left shoulder.",
  "but you have to put this shoulder back.",
  "so you can see where you're going.",
  "but this is a really hard position.",
  "to actually learn to skate backwards in.",
  "so what i suggest is.",
  "to square your shoulders back up.",
  "and this is a much easier position to learn in.",
  "however you are now not looking behind you.",
  "so you're going to need a spotter.",
  "a friend who's going to check.",
  "what's behind you.",
  "if you're on your own.",
  "particularly if you're outdoors.",
  "check the floor for debris.",
  "so what i would suggest is clear.",
  "all the twigs and the stones for an area.",
  "and then put a bag or something at the end of that area.",
  "so when you're going backwards.",
  "and you spot your bag.",
  "you know don't go any further.",
  "because you could roll over a twig or a stone.",
  "and i don't want you falling over.",
  "and i don't want it putting you off.",
  "and also talking about safety.",
  "i'm not wearing it.",
  "please wear yours especially helmet for backwards.",
  "because if you do do one of these falls backwards.",
  "i don't want you hitting your head wrist guards.",
  "helmet definite definite for backwards learning.",
  "Getting Started.",
  "a good place to start for backwards.",
  "is to do a snake pattern.",
  "but a really good way to get yourself in the right position.",
  "is to do a snake pattern forwards and stop.",
  "and now your feet are in the perfect position.",
  "to push from the instep like we said already.",
  "into your backward snake.",
  "but a really good way to do this.",
  "is to forward snake towards something.",
  "so your counter in your kitchen.",
  "or a wall or a building.",
  "if you're outside.",
  "and then you've got something in front of you to push yourself off.",
  "because from this is really hard.",
  "so push yourself off from something.",
  "as you do your lemon.",
  "and do this a couple of times.",
  "to get the feeling of the backward snake.",
  "and when you've got the feeling.",
  "you can keep going.",
  "Safety Tips.",
  "before you go too far.",
  "i've got a couple of safety things just to mention.",
  "so when you're doing a backwards bubble lemon snake.",
  "don't let this feet touch at the back.",
  "so once you go past the midpoint and.",
  "they start to come in.",
  "you need to think about turning them out again.",
  "because the worst thing.",
  "you can do is to let those feet touch the back.",
  "because you're going to go splat.",
  "another thing to mention is to try and.",
  "keep your snake patterns equal.",
  "now everybody has a dominant foot.",
  "it's like being left-handed or right-handed.",
  "so one foot will be better at it than the other.",
  "if you have that.",
  "and it's significantly different.",
  "try and get the weaker foot to join in.",
  "Snake Pattern / Bubbles.",
  "push off from your if you need to.",
  "whatever's in front of you.",
  "and wait on the ball of your foot.",
  "press on the instep.",
  "and then before you get here.",
  "don't let them touch.",
  "so you're going to put more weight on the front of your feet.",
  "so more weight on the balls.",
  "so you can lift your heels and kick them out again.",
  "so pull them in weight on the ball of your foot.",
  "kick them out.",
  "there we go.",
  "and we are snaking.",
  "now i've always said that snake pattern isn't for everyone.",
  "so i'm going to show you an alternative to this as well.",
  "Snake Pattern/ Bubbles Progression.",
  "once you've got your snake and you're snaking fabulously.",
  "there's progression.",
  "so you do a snake and then you lift a foot.",
  "then you do a snake and you lift the other foot.",
  "i'll show you so snake lift snake lift snake.",
  "lift snake lift.",
  "so that's just gonna get you used to lifting your feet.",
  "whilst you're going backwards.",
  "when you're skating backwards.",
  "you lift your free foot.",
  "the one that's not skating forwards.",
  "because lifting it up backwards is quite awkward.",
  "so you always lift it forwards.",
  "Snake Alternative \"The Wiggle\".",
  "the alternative to snake.",
  "now i always.",
  "think of this.",
  "i don't think it has a name.",
  "but i just call it the wiggle.",
  "because you just got a bit of hip action going.",
  "so it's almost like a snake.",
  "on one than the other.",
  "so push off again much easier with a little bit of roll.",
  "and then you just kind of do one.",
  "than the other.",
  "so you get your little hip action going.",
  "and this is actually a lot easier.",
  "it's like a backwards slalom.",
  "but it's a lot easier.",
  "Snake Alternative \"The Wiggle\" Progression.",
  "so as with the snake the wiggle.",
  "also has a progression.",
  "where you can start to lift your feet.",
  "so if i show you.",
  "so you've got your little wiggle going here.",
  "and then what you want to do.",
  "is you want to slightly stagger your feet each time.",
  "and feel the weight go on this back foot.",
  "so then you can lift the front one.",
  "just like that.",
  "don't forget the push comes from the instep.",
  "Backwards Stroke Skating.",
  "so when i'm cruising particularly when i'm outside.",
  "because i think it's safer to keep.",
  "both feet on the ground.",
  "backwards when you're outside.",
  "so i tend to do the wiggle.",
  "but if you're in a rink then obviously.",
  "you can do the full backward skating.",
  "where you lift your feet if you want to.",
  "so skating backwards we always push from the inside.",
  "so with the snake we do the inside.",
  "and with the alternative we do the inside as well.",
  "so if you think about always having your feet turned slightly.",
  "inwards like this.",
  "and then what you want to create is this sort of action.",
  "so it's almost like a march.",
  "but it's backwards.",
  "so you're kind of pushing away.",
  "now this is backward skating.",
  "so once you get used to this you can actually start to straighten your feet.",
  "and the push will still come from the inside.",
  "but it's just not quite as obvious.",
  "and there we go backwards skating.",
  "you're really confident you can then turn your shoulders.",
  "Stopping Backwards.",
  "so so far we've just been concentrating on moving.",
  "but i better show you how to stop.",
  "backwards as well.",
  "now i think stopping backwards is the easiest way to stop.",
  "because these things on the front of your skates.",
  "actually come in really handy.",
  "you can even use one or two toe stops at the same time.",
  "and what you do is you just put the toe stop in ever.",
  "so gently and then apply more pressure as you start to slow down.",
  "i shall show you.",
  "so here we go.",
  "so one foot applying pressure.",
  "and easy should we show the two foot as well.",
  "here we go.",
  "so you need to make sure that your toe stops.",
  "aren't too high for this.",
  "because otherwise your foot will be too much of an angle.",
  "this toe stops actually quite high.",
  "so i feel like i'm slightly tipping forwards.",
  "so make sure your toe stops are adjusted.",
  "so when you do that you don't face plant.",
  "because that's not good.",
  "Back Pulls.",
  "as with forward skating.",
  "when you do your crossovers.",
  "there is the same version of this for backwards.",
  "but i call it a backwards pull.",
  "because you don't pick the feet up like you do forwards.",
  "for the backwards one.",
  "the leg that's inside your circle.",
  "pulls the other one across and it pulls you around.",
  "i'll show you how i do it.",
  "so you want to put the leg inside.",
  "and pull so you don't lift this front foot.",
  "back pulls are brilliant because you can get.",
  "so much speed in a much larger area obviously.",
  "in a rink you can do two.",
  "or three back pulls and you can be going so fast.",
  "they're really really good for speed.",
  "so you think of it as plant that one and pull this one across.",
  "that's.",
  "it so plant pull.",
  "Bye bye.",
  "so that's it you should now have all the.",
  "information you need to get you skating backwards.",
  "enjoy your journey and i'll see you next time.",
  "bye.",
  "Outtakes.",
  "but yeah i've rambled again haven't i.",
  "i've rambled.",
  "like ambidextrous or ambry footstress is that thing.",
  "i don't know.",
  "and also i've forgotten what the also.",
  "was.",
  "yeah can you use any of that maybe.",
  "you can skate forward you've got your balance.",
  "and everything forwards before.",
  "we start.",
  "and i'm rambling again.",
  "i want to go.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKXQRf_clTc&list=PLPHb4PtMjk0shrC0nwgRMvWwEDESn8KHc&index=12\">i want to go</a>",
  "Intro.",
  "as it's getting colder.",
  "lots of us skaters are having to go into the rink.",
  "and now it's great when you go to the rink.",
  "because you've got this lovely flat surface.",
  "but there's lots of annoying people like me.",
  "have been skating since they can walk.",
  "and they make it look.",
  "incredibly easy.",
  "and you're like why can't i do that it looks so easy surely i can.",
  "so i get the frustrations of learning.",
  "the idea is that.",
  "you enjoy the process of learning.",
  "so you enjoy your journey.",
  "which i so often say to people in the comments.",
  "so i'm going to show you a really nice move.",
  "which you can do.",
  "whether you're just learning to skate.",
  "you're just starting to roll.",
  "or if you're still just learning to stand up.",
  "in your home.",
  "so let's get on with it.",
  "this move is the crab.",
  "Getting Your Balance.",
  "so to do this you learn to transfer.",
  "your weight from your heel to your toe.",
  "so this is great.",
  "because i'm always saying.",
  "get control over these skates.",
  "and this is a great way to learn.",
  "control of your skates.",
  "because when you feel a wobble.",
  "it's because your weight's either too far back or too far forward.",
  "so if you're used to transferring the weight from the back to the front.",
  "this is going to really help you get stability.",
  "and of course if you want to you can use one of these.",
  "Using A Chair Correctly For Balance.",
  "one thing to note about my chair friend.",
  "here is he's got a little bit higher.",
  "because you don't want to ruin your posture.",
  "so if my chair's down here and i'm leaning like this.",
  "straight away my posture is wrong.",
  "so you want something that is at a natural height for your arm.",
  "so you're not leaning over.",
  "so that's quite nice.",
  "it's going to stabilize me.",
  "but it's not affecting my posture for skating.",
  "Which Foot?.",
  "your best to stand on the foot you feel.",
  "most comfortable on.",
  "and then do the move with the other one.",
  "so i'm going to use my right.",
  "but if you feel more comfortable the other way.",
  "do it that way.",
  "Crab Walk Technique.",
  "using my support i'm going to put more.",
  "weight on my left foot.",
  "and then i'm going to lift the weight.",
  "off the front of my skate.",
  "and i'm just going to do that.",
  "this is the first bit.",
  "and then we're going to do the same thing.",
  "but we're going to put more weight on the front of that skate.",
  "and we're going to lift.",
  "the back don't forget always nice soft knees.",
  "and then we do them together.",
  "so front back.",
  "front back.",
  "and then bring it back in again.",
  "so that's the move.",
  "so the idea is we're going to do this with both feet.",
  "Moving.",
  "like this.",
  "so it might be a good idea.",
  "to try this without your skates on first.",
  "to feel.",
  "the movement across the floor.",
  "because although we're doing.",
  "this we're going to go in one direction or the other.",
  "so you're going to progress.",
  "that way or you're going to progress that way.",
  "so to get the push and pull.",
  "try it without your skates on so you can feel push.",
  "either way.",
  "i've shown you that you go back front.",
  "Both Feet Together - Stopping The Roll.",
  "it's quite hard to stop your wheels from rolling.",
  "and the way i do this is a little bit cheeky.",
  "so i'm doing this movement.",
  "but i'm not lifting both the front feet.",
  "i'm lifting one toe and one heel.",
  "so i'm actually doing that.",
  "Both Feet Together - Easier Version.",
  "that heel toe might be a little bit tricky to get first.",
  "so you know what.",
  "let's just do the two together.",
  "so let's do this.",
  "so then it's two heels.",
  "two toes two heels two toes.",
  "but don't forget our friend.",
  "so two heels two toes.",
  "and that will give you the feel of it.",
  "Arms.",
  "as with everything in skating.",
  "the arms are a huge help.",
  "so i'm kind of doing this.",
  "but when you're learning.",
  "it's best to do it with your arms straight out.",
  "because you think of the tight rope walker that uses their arms for balance.",
  "that's what you're doing.",
  "Alternative Version.",
  "you can have quite a lot of fun with this.",
  "so we said about doing it like this.",
  "and then doing it like this.",
  "but you can also do it where you progress one foot forwards.",
  "so i do there.",
  "and then on this one i move this foot forward.",
  "and then there.",
  "and then i take it back.",
  "and then again i can do the other foot further forwards like that.",
  "so you can have a lot of fun with it.",
  "and this will really really help you get control of your skates.",
  "before you even do anything.",
  "and then when you start trying to skate.",
  "you're going to find it so much easier.",
  "we're talking about enjoying your journey.",
  "Enjoy The Journey.",
  "so when you're learning this.",
  "just put some music on.",
  "and just feel it and enjoy yourself.",
  "Bye Bye.",
  "i hope you really enjoy this one.",
  "and it helps you enjoy your skating journey.",
  "i'm really enjoying this.",
  "so i'm going to do some tic tocs before i take my skates off.",
  "i'm kt you've been watching skatey.",
  "and i'll see you next time.",
  "bye.",
  "Outtakes.",
  "and i'm rambling.",
  "you can try which either foot nope and move.",
  "the other one.",
  "i've got two feet it's a thing.",
  "most yeah.",
  "it's time you'll probably want to snow.",
  "just to do this and then doing it like this.",
  "i'm literally doing i might chicken.",
  "do that again.",
  "showing my uh my 80s.",
  "inner child.",
  "okay um.",
  "least best.",
  "wow.",
  "okay.",
  "and the leg.",
  "we'll get there it's okay.",
  "music and move to the music and it will give you joy.",
  "that's rubbish.",
  "well i hope you have lots of fun with this one.",
  "ouch take skater smash his face."
