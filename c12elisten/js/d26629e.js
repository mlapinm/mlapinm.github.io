  "once upon a time in tasmila land far far away.",
  "there lived a well-off merchant with his wisdom and subtlety he had been able to set up his own business with all kinds of customers from aristocrats to commoners.",
  "he had solely one son named connor and connor was expected to take over the family's business.",
  "however connor was an opposite version of his father.",
  "he would always look down on poor people and only make friends with those who he considered as the upper class.",
  "the merchant had a young servant named hunt who he regarded as intelligent.",
  "kind and generous because of that he let hunt follow and support conor.",
  "however seeing hunt come from a poor family conor was always despising him.",
  "such a poor servant what a shame.",
  "the merchant worried about the future.",
  "when he saw his son behaving like that.",
  "so he tried to advise to his son.",
  "my son those poor customers are also as important as others.",
  "because without them we wouldn't be able to have this position.",
  "you should respect and serve them well.",
  "it's not my duty to serve those low-class people father.",
  "i will ask someone like hunt to do that instead.",
  "connor didn't care about his father's advice making the merchant so disappointed.",
  "one day he called both connor and hunt to come to see him.",
  "up the krumgar mountain there is a sacred temple you need to go there to train and get yourself ready to take over our family's business.",
  "go there with hunt he can help you out on the way.",
  "the two young men set out the merchant hoped that this journey would change his son in a better way.",
  "along the way hunt always tried to start a conversation with his master.",
  "did connor barely paid any attention to him.",
  "what a luxurious place for people of high class like me.",

  "lucy immediately prepared a luxurious suite for connor.",
  "are you satisfied with this room sir.",
  "take some time to rest and i will prepare your meal a lavish one.",
  "meanwhile hunt had to sleep on a dry haystack nearby the stable.",
  "suddenly a horse stood next to him started to whisper.",
  "hey buddy who who's calling me.",
  "it's you it's weird how can you talk.",
  "shh you're staying at lucy the witch is in.",
  "she usually enchants the food to turn the wealthy customers into horses and steal their assets.",
  "not only that she even feeds us and sells for money.",
  "i'm not the only horse that can talk here.",
  "really oh my god i have to find a way out about this.",
  "hunt snuck into the kitchen to watch.",
  "he saw lucy doing a weird thing she was planting the wheat seeds on the burning flame.",
  "few seconds later all of them grew up and produced lots of grains.",
  "what a lucky day.",
  "i caught another rich man after eating my pie.",
  "he will be turned into a horse immediately.",
  "hearing those words hunt immediately reached out to connor and told him the whole story.",
  "master don't eat anything that the inn owner gives you.",
  "she's a witch.",

  "i feel such pity for poor people like you.",
  "i saw it with my bare eyes why don't you believe me.",
  "stop it you want me to starve to death right.",
  "get out of here i have to rest.",
  "after a while lucy herself brought the pie to connor's room.",
  "he chuckled when recalling the panicky expression of hunt.",
  "so ridiculous what a daydreaming man.",
  "this pie is so delicious how can it be poisonous.",
  "however right after his first fight connor was turned into a black horse.",
  "at that moment lucy stepped inside with a mischievous smile.",
  "boom another horse to my collection and your fortune will also be mine.",
  "he really is a witch just blame myself for not listening to hunt's advice.",
  "i even ridiculed him.",
  "hunt please help me.",
  "about hunt when the pie was brought to him he pretended to take it.",
  "waiting for the servant to get out he threw it right away.",
  "waiting inside the stable hunt was really worried.",
  "as he was going to check connor to see if he was still okay.",
  "hunt saw lucy leading the black horse out of the inn.",
  "seeing hunt the horse suddenly cried and it looked like it was asking for help.",
  "hunt was so suspicious that he came to ask lucy.",
  "where is my master what have you done to him.",
  "this servant is really cautious he didn't take for just one bite of the pie.",
  "anyway he has no money so i just need to chase him away.",
  "hey boy why are you being bad tempered like that.",
  "your master has left for a while.",
  "he must be waiting for you somewhere.",
  "moreover you poor servant don't have to pay for the room it's on me.",
  "people kick him out of here for me [Laughter].",
  "that black horse must be conor.",
  "what can i do to help him now.",
  "maybe i should go to the sacred temple.",
  "hopefully the magician will know the way to save connor.",
  "upon that hunt headed to the temple on the krumgar mountain without taking any rest.",
  "all he had left was the last bread and some pennies.",
  "finally after a long journey hunt managed to reach the sacred temple.",
  "he saw an old man who looked unusual sat in front of the gate.",
  "sir i'm here to see the great magician of the temple.",
  "you should go home he doesn't want to meet strangers.",
  "but sir this is an emergency case.",
  "bad things happen to my friend on the way.",
  "we came here and now i really need his help.",
  "all right then come on the magician is inside.",
  "but i have to keep your bag.",
  "thank you so much sir.",
  "the old man looked at hunt's bag mysteriously.",
  "and saw only one bread with some pennies.",
  "so he is a poor boy.",
  "then i would like to test him for a little bit.",
  "hunt walked around the huge temple.",
  "despite searching every room.",
  "he couldn't find anyone.",
  "why is there no one here is this temple abandoned.",
  "where is the magician.",
  "why did the old man trick me.",
  "since he hadn't eaten for days.",
  "hunt was indeed tired after seeking the magician.",
  "he remembered his last bread and came back to the old man.",
  "he was startled when seeing the old man who was chomping his bread.",
  "hunt was very angry.",
  "that was the most delicious thing i've ever eaten for my entire life.",
  "hope you don't get mad at me for being so rude.",
  "i haven't had anything in my stomach for days.",
  "so that's it for him i'm still young.",
  "i am still able to bear the hunger.",
  "i should let the old man eat that bread.",
  "it's all right sir.",
  "i will go to the nearby village to get something to eat.",
  "i guess that we'll say goodbye from here.",
  "what a kind young man.",
  "you didn't get angry at the old men who ate your last bread.",
  "and after experiencing those inconvenient events.",
  "i'm the magician of this temple.",
  "tell me what brings you here young boy.",
  "and he couldn't be happier he recounted the story to the magician.",
  "so that's the problem here.",
  "i have a spell which can swap everything in the blink of an eye.",
  "i'll give it to you.",
  "use it wisely and it will help you defeat the witch.",
  "the magician gave the magical spell to hunt.",
  "he delightedly took it and thanked him.",
  "hunt said goodbye to the old magician and returned.",
  "he didn't expect that in his bag there were three golden coins.",
  "that must be from the magician.",
  "now i don't need to worry about not having enough money.",
  "with three gold coins he came to a bakery to have a big feast there.",
  "he also ordered a pie that looked exactly like the one lucy usually made.",
  "he used the leftover money to buy clothes which made himself look like a luxurious and wealthy merchant.",
  "when he arrived at lucy's inn the witch couldn't be able to recognize him.",
  "i'm the merchant who just have returned from the imperial city.",
  "bring me the best suite that you have here money is not my problem.",
  "sir then you have come to the right place.",
  "please take time to rest sir.",
  "i'll prepare you the most lavish meal ever.",
  "waiting for the witch to get out of the room.",
  "hunt snuck into the stable.",
  "there he quickly realized conor the black horse.",
  "connor it's me hunt don't worry i'll get you out of here.",
  "then hunt had dinner with lucy.",
  "as he predicted she invited him to eat that pie again.",
  "what a coincidence i've just bought the most expensive pie in town it must be delicious.",
  "please have a bite.",
  "while lucy wasn't paying attention.",
  "hunt placed the spell on his pie.",
  "when they exchanged pies the spell shone brightly and the two pies were swapped in an instant and the witch didn't notice.",
  "hunt happily enjoyed his pie before lucy's eyes.",
  "upon seeing that she wasn't suspicious at all and grabbed a huge bite on the pie.",
  "immediately she was turned into an ugly gray horse.",
  "what's wrong with me.",
  "you evil witch lucy your magic turned its back on you.",
  "now you will be a horse for the rest of your life.",
  "as the witch became a horse all her magic also lost its power.",
  "all the horses in the stable turned back to human including connor.",
  "hunt you saved my life despite the way i treated you.",
  "i'm really sorry for that.",
  "from now on you are my best friend.",
  "they returned home together.",
  "since then conor completely turned over a new leaf.",
  "he started learning business management method from his father.",
  "and serving poor customers.",
