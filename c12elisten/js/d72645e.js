  "you can't go sneaking around looking in people's windows.",
  "I'll raid you if I see anything.",
  "I'm not gonna do anything that looks suspicious.",
  "I can't believe this is happening.",
  "oh come on Brock you know she's crazy when you married her.",
  "no I can't believe.",
  "I'm sitting out here because you don't trust me.",
  "Kira's been living with me for a whole month.",
  "so obviously she's gone wild I'm that bad apparent.",
  "well I'm not here to argue with you Brock.",
  "all I know is when she lived with me.",
  "I knew what she was up to.",

  "and I never hear the end of it.",
  "hey I know what Kira is up to.",
  "she's out with friends.",
  "well that's not good enough.",
  "you need to know which friends.",
  "and where they're going for.",
  "how long and get a phone number.",
  "and then get a cell number.",
  "in case they lie about the phone number.",
  "or maybe we could put a chip in her head and track her by satellite.",
  "well if you weren't so cheap.",
  "did you ever stop.",
  "and think that maybe one of the reasons Kira moved in with me.",
  "is because I trust her.",
  "you know what.",
  "we might have to be here on a Stakeout.",
  "but we don't have to talk.",
  "fine.",
  "fine.",

  "my mom kept track of my lip gloss.",
  "I know we would go through like a tube a week.",
  "I remember when my mom kept that old couch out in the garage.",
  "I thought my lips would fall off.",
  "you know it was kind of fun sneaking around.",
  "never knowing if we're gonna get caught or not.",
  "yeah sitting there in the dark.",
  "the scent of strawberry passion on our faces.",
  "what's wrong.",
  "nothing's wrong that's the problem.",
  "there's no tension.",

  "what are you doing.",

  "but then I realized.",
  "she's my leader.",
  "spot on my kid today Brock.",
  "I'm spying on her right now.",
  "well unless she doesn't show up.",
  "then you'd just be some creepy old lady watching the teenager's party.",
  "because I don't know who she is anymore.",
  "here's only been out of the house for a month.",
  "and she's got a whole new life.",
  "I don't know about.",
  "hey try three years.",
  "when I moved out Cheyenne was drill team captain.",
  "Jake was learning to tie his shoes.",
  "and Carol was just a smart mouth kid.",
  "every parent looks at their kid and thinks.",
  "oh they grow up so fast.",
  "and I never realized how fast.",
  "until I wasn't there every day to see it.",

  "you know I get Barbara Jean doing this.",
  "and dad has to tag along in case he needs to post bail.",
  "but not you Mom.",
  "hey hey hey hey hey.",
  "and we all know what your mom did was wrong.",
  "this is wrong kicking around with boys.",
  "I know it's kind of dark out.",
  "but if you borrow Barbara Jean's spy goggles.",
  "you'll be able to see I'm not Cheyenne.",
  "well maybe we got confused.",
  "because you're wearing her boy meat and sweater.",
  "so you guys really think I'm so stupid.",
  "that I'd sneak off and have sex when I'm 14.",
  "and even if I did why would I wear Cheyenne's sweater.",
  "for good luck.",
  "knew me better than that.",
  "well I used to since you moved out we don't talk.",

  "from now on you have to check with both me and your mother.",
  "but maybe you thought you'd have it easy living with me.",
  "because Dad's a pushover.",
  "well let me tell you something.",
  "living with me isn't going to be a free ride.",
  "and it isn't a license to cut your mother out of your life either.",
  "but that's not fair.",
  "well good then I must be doing something right.",
  "say goodnight to your friends.",
  "oh and tell Brandon.",
  "I'm going to be sending his parents a nice little thank you note for.",
  "letting him throw this party.",

  "thanks Brock.",
  "hey red hands off the merchandise."
