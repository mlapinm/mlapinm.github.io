  "Intro.",
  "in this video we cover the many obstacles you encounter.",
  "when skating outside.",
  "and how to negotiate them safely.",
  "Introduction to outside skating.",
  "so skating outside it's definitely different to skating in a rink.",
  "it's so unforgiving so.",
  "first things first is you're gonna need all your safety gear specifically knee pads.",
  "and a helmet.",
  "because you fall over on the concrete and hit your head bad.",
  "so you need all your safety gear.",
  "now skating outside is really intimidating.",
  "especially if you've been learning indoors say on.",
  "wooden floor on your tiles in your house.",
  "and all of a sudden you go outside.",
  "and it's almost like having to learn again.",
  "because your wheels indoors will slip and slide.",
  "and it will help you to turn and stop.",
  "and then you come outside.",
  "and you put these gummy wheels on.",
  "so it absorbs all the bumps but they don't slip at all.",
  "so all of a sudden to create any movement.",
  "you're gonna have to lift your feet a lot more.",
  "and it's a lot more intimidating.",
  "so take it easy outside it will take time.",
  "and it's definitely different to being in your house or on a rink.",
  "Wheels.",
  "one of the most important pieces of equipment.",
  "when you're skating outside other than.",
  "your safety gear is the wheels.",
  "now when you're skating outside.",
  "you need a softer wheel.",
  "so wheels go from hard to soft.",
  "hard's around 100 and soft is sort of 75-78.",
  "there's no rule that says you can't wear 100 outside if you want to.",
  "on this foot i have a 75.",
  "and on this foot i have a 100.",
  "so just to demonstrate for you the difference in the ride.",
  "so i shall do the delicate soft outdoor wheel first.",
  "so it's nice and gentle and it's smooth.",
  "it's absorbing all the bumps.",
  "and now for the 100 so it's not that it doesn't roll outside.",
  "it's just that it's rattling my bones.",
  "and it's not very comfortable.",
  "but it depends what you're doing outside.",
  "this wheel will not move.",
  "Wheels - Slippy Verses Grippy.",
  "so if i try and move my foot left to right.",
  "it really doesn't want to go anywhere at all.",
  "if i try and move this foot left to right.",
  "it's slippy because the harder wheels have more slip.",
  "whereas the softer wheels are much grippier.",
  "so if you're going to try and do turns.",
  "and things like that it's going to be much easier in a harder wheel.",
  "and it's going to be much harder in this soft gummy wheel.",
  "you're going to have to almost jump your.",
  "foot whereas this one.",
  "you can slide your foot so it's all.",
  "personal preference but.",
  "definitely if you're going for a more comfortable ride.",
  "i'd recommend the 75 78 80 90 a push.",
  "Terrain.",
  "so when you're skating outside.",
  "you're going to encounter all different types of terrain.",
  "you'll have to experience it to know.",
  "how your wheels are going to react.",
  "so as a beginner.",
  "i would hugely recommend.",
  "that when you're out and about to scout for skating areas.",
  "and to literally walk there.",
  "put your skates on when you get to a safe area.",
  "because you don't want to be taken by surprise by a bit of terrain.",
  "that your wheels don't roll on.",
  "and you splat okay so this is a really good example.",
  "of some unusual terrain that you might encounter.",
  "Terrain examples.",
  "so obviously.",
  "these that's not gonna happen now.",
  "these are actually you look like you can roll over them.",
  "but actually my kingpin drags on these.",
  "so the safest way to encounter them.",
  "is to good old toe stops.",
  "when you're outside.",
  "your toe stops are invaluable.",
  "they will rescue you and save you from many an obstacle.",
  "now this is a great terrain.",
  "this is actually quite nice to skate on.",
  "but if this was all lumpy and bumpy.",
  "you can walk if you have some grass beside you.",
  "that it's much more comfortable to actually.",
  "walk on the grass.",
  "because you have less roll.",
  "and the grass actually tends to be quite smooth.",
  "compared to the rough pavement.",
  "another really good skill to have for skating outside.",
  "is the ability to bail to the grass.",
  "Bailing to the grass.",
  "so by this i mean you're skating along.",
  "and there's an obstacle in the way.",
  "and you can run onto the grass.",
  "so you have to bear in mind that.",
  "when you're skating and rolling you've got a forward momentum.",
  "so when you hit the grass.",
  "you often have to run a little bit just to keep that momentum.",
  "so you don't fall over.",
  "i'll show you what i mean.",
  "so i'm skating along.",
  "and there's a dog or a child in the way.",
  "so i'm gonna hit the grass.",
  "but because you've got full momentum.",
  "you have to jog to a stop.",
  "you can also do it by hopping back on again.",
  "so i'll show you that as well.",
  "so i'm skating and there's an obstacle.",
  "i can go around the obstacle and back on.",
  "Standing still outside.",
  "another really fun aspect of skating outside.",
  "is that nearly everywhere has these hidden cambers and hidden inclines.",
  "so you can be standing still and all of a sudden.",
  "you just start to move so it's really important to stand.",
  "so all i do is i turn my feet inwards.",
  "and if you stand like that.",
  "it will stop you from rolling without wanting to.",
  "because all of a sudden.",
  "you can start to roll.",
  "and it can really take you by surprise.",
  "and you do a nasty back.",
  "and they're really horrible.",
  "so always remember outside.",
  "you need to physically stop your wheels from rolling.",
  "so just turning your feet in.",
  "it's a really great way of doing that.",
  "you can put a little bit of pressure on the outsides.",
  "here just to make sure you really don't go anywhere.",
  "Uphill.",
  "let's do uphill first.",
  "so there are two main ways to do uphill.",
  "the first one is stroke skating.",
  "so it's loads of power.",
  "so if you're looking for the more athletic side of skating.",
  "and you want to build up a bit of a sweat.",
  "then this is for you it's a great thigh workout as well.",
  "the other way is similar to stroke skating.",
  "but you're going to use your toe.",
  "stop to give you the power.",
  "i shall show you both of them.",
  "Uphill - Stroke Skating.",
  "so the first option is one.",
  "that's really good for the thighs.",
  "so you're going to push from the inside.",
  "each time so this is proper stroke skating.",
  "and you've got to use a lot of power.",
  "are you ready.",
  "Uphill - Toe Stops.",
  "the other option is to do the same as stroke skating.",
  "but rather than pushing from the instep.",
  "this time you're going to push from the toe stop.",
  "so i shall show you this one as well.",
  "so this is more toast toaster.",
  "Downhill.",
  "so i've shown you how to go uphill.",
  "i better show you how to get back down again.",
  "so there are three main ways to go downhill.",
  "firstly you need to be in the staggered stance.",
  "so again you can use either foot in front.",
  "give you that nice platform so you're nice and safe.",
  "now some hills are very steep.",
  "and you need to brake almost the entire time.",
  "so i use the front two wheels on either foot.",
  "just to drag them behind me.",
  "if you're a little bit more advanced.",
  "you can go down backwards.",
  "and just use one toe stop.",
  "and the third one is carving.",
  "which creates like a slalom down the hill.",
  "but this works best if you've got a long wide hill.",
  "because you need quite a bit of space.",
  "but i'll show you how it works anyway.",
  "Downhill - Forward wheel drag.",
  "right so this is staggered stance.",
  "and i'm just going to show you.",
  "how i break with the front two wheels.",
  "so here we go so standard stance.",
  "and then i'm picking up speed.",
  "so i'm just going to drag my back two wheels.",
  "slow down a little bit back to stagger stance.",
  "braking again.",
  "Downhill - Backwards toe stop.",
  "so the next one is the backwards one.",
  "so pick whichever foot you prefer.",
  "to have at the back.",
  "so this you're creating the staggered stance.",
  "but you're going to have one toe stop in.",
  "obviously you can let it gather speed.",
  "and then pop the toe stop back in.",
  "so you can keep it down the whole time.",
  "or you can just let it roll and then up too fast.",
  "and slow yourself down again.",
  "you can do it on either foot.",
  "Downhill - Carving.",
  "so the last one is carving.",
  "so i'll show you the technique.",
  "so basically this works because.",
  "you're going horizontal across the hill.",
  "then you go down it for a little bit.",
  "then you turn.",
  "so every time you go horizontal across the hill you lose speed.",
  "so i'll show you what i mean.",
  "so i'm going to go down the hill.",
  "but i'm going to carve round.",
  "and then i'm going to carve again.",
  "and again so you see how every time i go horizontal.",
  "it slows me down.",
  "let me just break down the actual carve.",
  "Downhill - Carving Technique.",
  "so you know what each foot's doing.",
  "so basically the hard work is being done.",
  "by the foot on the outside.",
  "so each time the foot.",
  "so when you're turning to the left of right foot is doing all the work.",
  "and then when you turn to the right.",
  "the left foot's doing all the work.",
  "and on that outside foot you're leaning on this instep.",
  "so you're almost doing this.",
  "but obviously it's much easier with two feet.",
  "so this puts kind of along for the ride.",
  "so you want to release a bit of pressure here.",
  "so this foot will go around.",
  "so what i do is i actually tend to lift the front wheel.",
  "just to make it easier.",
  "it's like this.",
  "now you can leave this foot on the floor.",
  "but if you've got really gummy wheels on.",
  "you might just have to hop it around a bit.",
  "Bye bye.",
  "i hope some of the tips in this video helped.",
  "to make your outdoor skating experience a little bit more enjoyable.",
  "i'm katie you've been watching skatey.",
  "and i'll see you next time.",
  "bye.",
  "Outtakes.",
  "welcome to the peaceful british countryside.",
  "eating my hair.",
  "if you want to go slightly more relaxed.",
  "we can use the toe shop.",
  "it's toast.",
  "toe shop.",
  "and it's most like it.",
  "but this time rather than pushing from.",
  "the in stop you're in.",
  "why can't i say things.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m3JFu0Y9_M&list=PLPHb4PtMjk0shrC0nwgRMvWwEDESn8KHc\">why can't i say things</a>",
  "Intro.",
  "in one video we showed you how to do this.",
  "in the next video we showed you how to do this.",
  "in this video i'm going to show.",
  "you how to combine the two.",
  "so turning from forwards to backwards.",
  "and then backwards to forwards.",
  "i'm katie and you're watching skatey.",
  "Turning Forwards to Backwards Tips.",
  "let's quickly talk about weight before we start.",
  "so in order to turn from forwards to backwards.",
  "let's do that first.",
  "you need to be able to put your weight slightly more towards the ball of the foot.",
  "so you need to be able to almost stand.",
  "like this.",
  "not fully not completely lifting your heels.",
  "but you need to lift those heels off slightly.",
  "so you can turn.",
  "a really important thing to note.",
  "is your shoulders will really help you to turn.",
  "so if i'm skating forwards.",
  "and i want to turn to backwards.",
  "the first thing i need to do is open my shoulder.",
  "now i'm this is if i'm turning to the left.",
  "so if i'm turning to the left.",
  "i'm going to open my shoulder.",
  "so when i turn my shoulders have taken me round.",
  "most important thing to be careful of.",
  "is that the rotation doesn't continue.",
  "so what you need to do is to check.",
  "this back shoulder so it doesn't continue round.",
  "so you want to stop when you're square.",
  "as i travel forward.",
  "my shoulders are square in my direction of travel.",
  "but i'm going to turn.",
  "so now i need to turn this shoulder.",
  "and turn the hip which will help me turn this leg.",
  "and then as i turn i'm going to square back up again.",
  "so this is a closed shoulder position.",
  "and this is an open shoulder position closed.",
  "so i start closed and i turn.",
  "and i close again.",
  "when you turn from backwards to forwards.",
  "you will feel more comfortable going one way than the other.",
  "again it's like left-handed right-handed.",
  "so the way to tell which is your dominant foot.",
  "is next time you walk up the stairs.",
  "just take a notice of which foot you lift onto the stairs first.",
  "that tends to be your dominant foot.",
  "and you also have a natural way.",
  "that feels more natural to turn.",
  "so i like to turn this way.",
  "but you may prefer turning this way.",
  "so it all depends what feels most comfortable for you.",
  "it's great if you can do both ways eventually.",
  "but start with whichever feels the most comfortable.",
  "and then you can work up from there.",
  "the safest way to try this for the first.",
  "time is standing still.",
  "Standing Still Demonstration.",
  "because that way if you end up with your feet against.",
  "your direction of travel.",
  "you're not going to fall.",
  "the hardest thing about this move.",
  "is to get your feet round.",
  "so if i've got my weight on my right foot.",
  "this left foot is free.",
  "this left foot can almost lift up.",
  "there's not much weight on this at all.",
  "but because this is the first time.",
  "we've done it we want to have a little bit of weight on here.",
  "because two feet is good for security.",
  "so most of your weight on this right leg.",
  "now this foot is going to go down behind you.",
  "and then you're going to put the weight on this one.",
  "and then this foot more weight on the ball of the foot.",
  "and then you can turn it.",
  "now i know this.",
  "is a really awkward position.",
  "but once you get it.",
  "you need to be in that position for a split second.",
  "let's try it moving slowly.",
  "Moving Demonstration.",
  "so weight on my right foot turn this left one.",
  "wait on the ball of my foot.",
  "so i can swivel this one round.",
  "and your backwards.",
  "i'm going to do it one more time nice.",
  "Turning with your Shoulders.",
  "and slowly and i want you to watch my shoulders.",
  "how they open when i do the turn.",
  "so my weight is all forwards.",
  "and as i bring this foot round.",
  "i have to open my shoulders to match my feet.",
  "and then wait on here.",
  "and i turn and close my shoulders at the same time.",
  "and that action will really help to turn.",
  "your body and turn your hips.",
  "Turning Backwards to Forwards.",
  "now i'm not going to sugarcoat this one.",
  "it is a more advanced skill.",
  "so to be able to do this you need to be able to skate.",
  "backwards on one leg.",
  "whichever leg you feel the most comfortable.",
  "but you do need to be relatively secure.",
  "on one leg backwards.",
  "pick your preferred leg.",
  "Standing Still Demonstration.",
  "so for me it's my left leg.",
  "and i'm going to go left to right.",
  "so you start off square.",
  "free leg in front because you're going backwards.",
  "and then you bring this leg in.",
  "and as you bring it in you start to turn your hips.",
  "now the cool thing about turning from backwards to forwards.",
  "is you don't have to do.",
  "this position it's very awkward.",
  "you can push from just behind the hill like that.",
  "one thing to mention with this is that.",
  "it's quite normal when you start.",
  "to do this and then lots of people kind of scoop that leg.",
  "this back one.",
  "but that's okay.",
  "because we're learning it's no problem.",
  "i mean i'm from an artistic skating background.",
  "so we have to do this.",
  "but you can do.",
  "whatever feels the most comfortable for you.",
  "okay so let's do it rolling.",
  "so here we go.",
  "Moving Demonstration.",
  "all your weight on here.",
  "turn the shoulders.",
  "bring the foot round onto a nice bent knee.",
  "now this is hard.",
  "so please be patient with yourself you will get it.",
  "just take it at your own pace.",
  "so that's it backwards forwards.",
  "and forwards to backwards.",
  "Bye Bye.",
  "now remember that these are quite advanced skills.",
  "so be patient with yourself.",
  "keep yourself safe helmets please.",
  "and wrist guards.",
  "and i'm katie and you've been watching skatey.",
  "and i'll see you next time.",
  "bye.",
  "Outtakes.",
  "once you've picked your preferred leg.",
  "it's a tongue twister.",
  "once you've picked your preferred leg.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bSFVIiPpGs&list=PLPHb4PtMjk0shrC0nwgRMvWwEDESn8KHc&index=9\">once you've picked your preferred leg</a>",
  "Intro.",
  "not sure how to adjust your roller skate.",
  "or perhaps you're brand new to skating.",
  "and you don't know if you need to adjust your skates.",
  "stick around and i'm going to show you how.",
  "i'm katie and you're watching skatey.",
  "how do you know if you need to adjust your skates.",
  "things can work loose over time.",
  "or you might have just taken your skates out of the box for the very.",
  "first time.",
  "Adjust Your Wheels.",
  "so let's check your wheels first make.",
  "sure they're rolling.",
  "so this one.",
  "that's great that's rolling no problem.",
  "but this one.",
  "this is really tight you.",
  "can see there's not it's not free rolling.",
  "so let's loosen this lock nut.",
  "it's the same as anything lefty loosey righty-tighty.",
  "so i'm going to loosen it about half a turn.",
  "there we go.",
  "look we've got some roll.",
  "now you can loosen it.",
  "but make sure you don't get play up and down.",
  "but that's fine.",
  "i'm going to leave that.",
  "so this one.",
  "can you hear that.",
  "we've got a lot of planer you don't want to skate on that.",
  "that's really dangerous.",
  "so let's see if we can tighten it up now.",
  "this lock nut is now fully tightened.",
  "but listen.",
  "we've still got the same problem.",
  "so what we can do in this case.",
  "is to use a washer.",
  "so let's take this off.",
  "we'll take the lock nut all the way off.",
  "and we'll put the washer on on top.",
  "now let's tighten it and see.",
  "if we lose that little bit of play.",
  "this is a really good spanner as well by the way.",
  "let's see how it's bent.",
  "which means you can get in past the wheel.",
  "just tighten that back up.",
  "make sure that we've lost the play on.",
  "that so it's nice and free rolling and yeah.",
  "nice and tight.",
  "so we can skate on that now without being dangerous.",
  "so that's a really quick way.",
  "just to make sure.",
  "that your wheels are rolling safely and freely.",
  "Adjust Your Toe Stops.",
  "so how do you know if your toe stops need adjusting.",
  "so i've mentioned this in a previous video.",
  "that when you put your toe stop down.",
  "you want your foot to be at about a 45 degree angle.",
  "so that's kind of okay.",
  "now some cheap escapes have like this one.",
  "where you have a bolt.",
  "so you cannot adjust this toe stop.",
  "which as it wears down over time.",
  "it will get too high.",
  "so you could get replacements for these quite easily.",
  "if it's too high from the very beginning.",
  "it's kind of difficult.",
  "because there's not a great deal.",
  "that you can do to give you a lot of depth on.",
  "this because it is a bolt.",
  "these ones are adjustable.",
  "and lots of skates do have adjustable toe stops.",
  "so you can make them lower as they wear down.",
  "so this one is about a 45 degree angle that's pretty good.",
  "you may want it lower if you're using these to stop on ramps.",
  "that kind of thing.",
  "you might want them higher.",
  "if you're skating outside.",
  "so you don't catch stones.",
  "this is a really easy one to adjust.",
  "because you just got your allen key.",
  "you normally get all the tools you need with your skates.",
  "but if not.",
  "it's quite easy to find tools.",
  "that will fit just at your local hardware store.",
  "so this is just again loose enough.",
  "this is really tight because this is a really old plate.",
  "there we go.",
  "and then that will just nice.",
  "and easily just twist down.",
  "and then once you're happy.",
  "with where it is.",
  "just tighten it back up again.",
  "Adjust Your Trucks.",
  "a really important thing to check.",
  "when you get new skates.",
  "or if you've been skating for a while.",
  "and you're having.",
  "trouble with learning new skills.",
  "is the fact that your trucks may not be loose enough.",
  "now the easiest way to test this.",
  "is to stand in your boot.",
  "and lean all your weight to the inside.",
  "on the big toe.",
  "and see if these wheels here come together.",
  "and do the same thing.",
  "and lean on your little toe.",
  "and see if these two wheels here lean together.",
  "it's quite hard to do with your hands.",
  "but the weight of your body will make that flex a lot.",
  "if they're tight.",
  "we need to show you how to adjust them.",
  "now these have a lock nut here.",
  "so you will need to loosen that.",
  "before you can adjust the top one.",
  "whether it's an allen key or a nut there.",
  "so again you'll need to loosen that off.",
  "one or two turns just to give you a little bit of movement.",
  "with trucks you don't want to be going a whole turn.",
  "you just want to try like a quarter of a turn half a turn.",
  "if they're really tight.",
  "because any movement is going to make a massive difference.",
  "if you think you can move it with your hands.",
  "that's definitely too loose.",
  "so you just put it in and turn.",
  "so once you're happy with this bit.",
  "you must remember to tighten this one back up again.",
  "that's very important.",
  "so i turned that too.",
  "because this is a click action.",
  "so i did one too on that.",
  "these are really easy.",
  "because all you've got is the nut on the top.",
  "and you just loosen that to the left a little bit.",
  "so let me see so here we go.",
  "so again you only want to go like half a turn.",
  "put the skate on.",
  "push and see how loose it is.",
  "you don't want them too loose.",
  "because you're going to just be completely out of control.",
  "if you can move it with your hand.",
  "chances are it's too loose.",
  "in the hole there are two types of trucks.",
  "this truck which is a bush truck bush nut.",
  "so for that you only need to adjust this top nut.",
  "and then you have this type of plate.",
  "which has the lock nut at the bottom.",
  "which you must adjust.",
  "first to be able to adjust this top bit.",
  "Roller Skate Tool Recommendation.",
  "one thing i do recommend especially.",
  "if you are traveling a distance.",
  "to roller skate.",
  "is to take with you some tools.",
  "so the bare minimum.",
  "i would suggest would be a spanner for your wheel nuts.",
  "and a spanner that also fits your trucks.",
  "because if either of those are off.",
  "you're going to have trouble skating.",
  "i would also recommend to take the tool.",
  "that fits your toe stop.",
  "for me it's an allen key.",
  "and again if you've got a loose toe stop.",
  "it's going to be dangerous to skate on.",
  "so always best to take a bare minimum.",
  "now you can make minor adjustments.",
  "to your roller skates confidently.",
  "so you've got your wheels rolling.",
  "you've got your trucks moving better.",
  "so this has been a really quick summary.",
  "of how to adjust your skates.",
  "but in a future video we're going to go into.",
  "the full anatomy of the roller skate.",
  "so you can make any changes.",
  "that you want to customize your skates.",
  "one last thing to mention.",
  "this sweatshirt is available on amazon.",
  "and we've also got a couple of different t-shirts on there as well.",
  "so i'll put the links in the description box below.",
  "i'm katie and you've been watching skatey.",
  "see you next time."
