  "what should we do now.",
  "we are so lucky to see where they buried the trunk.",
  "i will use this to force them.",
  "to give us a big amount of money.",
  "then jackson lucas immediately came to ryan's house to threaten and blackmail.",
  "ryan we knew everything you killed the golden deer of the king.",
  "you had better give us a bag full of gold and we will think about keeping it secret.",
  "yes just a gold back if not i'm afraid that we have to report this to the king.",
  "and you will have to stay in jail for the rest of your life.",
  "just as claire predicted the two friends showed their true nature and ryan was very angry.",
  "jax lucas i was so wrong.",
  "i thought that you two were my best friends.",
  "i won't give you any money you can do whatever you want.",
  "if it is your choice ryan then get ready to see the king.",
  "next day they came to see the king to report ryan.",
  "your majesty we saw ryan brothers killed your deer.",
  "they even hit its body in a trunk and buried it in the jungle your majesty.",
  "guards bring the ryan brothers here for me.",
  "a moment later ryan and mateo were brought in front of the king.",
  "is it true that you guys killed my golden deer and buried it in the jungle.",
  "your majesty we didn't do anything.",
  "they accused us without any evidence.",
  "yes your majesty if you just listen from one side of the story and then punish us.",
  "then we could not find your actions convincing.",
  "your majesty we witnessed everything we have evidence.",
  "we will take you to that place so they can't deny it anymore.",
  "lucas and jax immediately took the king to the empty land.",
  "ryan and mateo were brought after.",
  "the trunk was quickly dug up by guards.",
  "following the two bad guys instructions.",
  "but when it was opened everyone only saw nothing but a giant rock.",
  "jacks lucas this is your golden deer huh.",
  "please forgive me your majesty.",
  "unbelievable we saw them bury the trunk here with our own eyes.",
  "at that moment claire appeared with the golden deer.",
  "the king was overjoyed because his deer was still alive.",
  "while jax and lucas were startled.",
  "this is really my precious deer.",
  "thank god so you two have found and taken care of it right.",
  "yes your majesty please forgive us for not telling you sooner.",
  "no problem you guys are innocent.",
  "he immediately ordered guards to put jackson lucas into jail for slandering and deceiving the king.",
