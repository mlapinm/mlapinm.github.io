  "6 Things to Stop Saying If You Want to Learn English.",
  "Hi, I’m Oli.",
  "Welcome to Oxford Online English!.",
  "In this lesson, you’ll see six things we often hear from English learners we meet.",
  "We see them in YouTube comments.",
  "We hear them in classes.",
  "Do you want to learn English and make faster progress?.",
  "Of course you do!.",
  "You should stop saying these things.",
  "Stop saying “It’s difficult.” Definitely, never say “It’s too difficult.” Instead, say “I need more time.” When you say “It’s difficult,” you’re immediately taking a negative approach.",
  "It’s like saying “I can’t do it,” “I should give up,” “There’s no point trying.” This way of thinking makes you feel bad about yourself, and it discourages you from trying further.",
  "Everything is difficult when it’s new and unfamiliar.",
  "When you learn English—or any language—you have to deal with many new and unfamiliar things.",
  "But, guess what?.",
  "With time and practice, everything gets easier.",
  "So, don’t say “This grammar point is too difficult.” Don’t say “Writing essays is too difficult.” Don’t say “Speaking fluently is difficult.” Say “I need more time to understand this grammar point.” Say “I need more time to learn how to write essays well.” Say “I need more time in order to speak more fluently.” This helps you approach your English learning in a positive way, so that you’re focused on improving and progressing.",
  "Stop saying “I understand.” Don’t say “I understand this vocabulary.” Don’t say “I understand these grammar rules.” Don’t say “I understand what people say, but I can’t respond!” Many English learners—and language learners generally—fall into the same trap.",
  "They confuse understanding something with knowing it.",
  "But, really knowing something—for most learners—means that you can use it.",
  "I understand *how* to play the piano.",
  "You hit the keys in the right order at the right times.",
  "I can’t play the piano.",
  "So, is it useful that I understand how?.",
  "No.",
  "Let’s come back to you, and your English.",
  "You’re reading something in English.",
  "You find a word you don’t know.",
  "You look it up in your dictionary, so you know the translation in your language.",
  "You think to yourself, “I know this word now.” You go to English class.",
  "Your teacher gives you exercises on a grammar point.",
  "You do the exercise, and you get most of the questions right.",
  "You think to yourself, “I know this grammar.” Maybe you even complain to your teacher, and say “This grammar is too easy!.",
  "I know this already!” You read a text.",
  "You understand it, or at least most of it.",
  "When you try to write something in English, it’s a mess.",
  "You can’t put your ideas into sentences, and your writing is full of mistakes.",
  "So then, you start saying things like “I understand words but I can’t use them!” “I understand when I listen, but I can’t speak!” “I understand grammar, but I make mistakes when I speak or write!” First of all, it’s natural for your passive skills to be better than your active skills.",
  "It’s natural that your listening and reading are better than your speaking and writing.",
  "To some extent, this is normal and it isn’t a problem.",
  "It’s true for native speakers, too.",
  "But, many English learners *do* have a problem here.",
  "They focus on understanding, and then they complain that they can’t use what they “know”. If you can’t use it, then you don’t know it.",
  "If you make mistakes with a grammar point, then you don’t know it.",
  "If you can’t use a word when you’re speaking, then you don’t know the word.",
  "It doesn’t matter if you’ve studied something a hundred times.",
  "Can you use it?.",
  "No?.",
  "Then you don’t know it.",
  "So, don’t say “I understand…” Instead, say “I can use this,” or “I can’t use this.” That’s what counts.",
  "That’s what you care about, right?.",
  "Stop saying “How do I…? Don’t say “How do I remember new words?” Don’t say “How do I get 7.5 in IELTS?” Don’t say “How do I improve my listening?” Instead, ask yourself “What can I do today?” Say “What can I do today to learn some new vocabulary?” Say “What can I do today to prepare for my IELTS exam?” Say “What can I do today to practise my listening skills?” We meet many students who ask huge, general questions like this.",
  "“How do I speak fluently?” “How do I write a high-scoring IELTS essay?” “How do I speak with a British accent?” These questions are too big.",
  "You don’t do one thing to speak fluently, you do many, many things over a long time.",
  "When you ask big, general questions like these, you get trapped in abstract generalities.",
  "You’re living in a future dream, where you somehow speak perfect English.",
  "But, you can’t control the future.",
  "All that time you spend thinking about the abstract future, you’re wasting time right now.",
  "Focus on what you can do today.",
  "There’s a saying in English.",
  "Actually, it’s in the form of a question: how do you eat an elephant?.",
  "Have you heard this?.",
  "Do you know the answer?.",
  "You eat an elephant one bite at a time.",
  "That’s what learning English is like.",
  "If you look at the whole task, it seems impossible.",
  "It’s like eating an elephant.",
  "It’s too big.",
  "But, you can do it.",
  "People do it!.",
  "It’s not even rare.",
  "You can do it, too.",
  "You just have to do it one bite at a time.",
  "Focus on what you can do today.",
  "That’s the only thing you can control.",
  "Stop asking questions like “How long will it take me to…?” Don’t say “How long does it take to become fluent in English?” Don’t say “How long will it take me to get band seven in IELTS?” Don’t say “How long will it take me to learn to negotiate in English for my work?” First, no one knows.",
  "You don’t know, and I don’t know.",
  "No one knows.",
  "Maybe you’re a genius and you’ll do it in four weeks.",
  "Maybe it’ll take you four years.",
  "Maybe you’ll never do it.",
  "How am I supposed to know?.",
  "How’s anyone supposed to know?.",
  "Every learner is a little bit different.",
  "No one has the same experience.",
  "Secondly, often, this question hides something underneath.",
  "This question often says “I don’t want to study English; I don’t want to spend my time and money studying English, but I have to.",
  "So, how can I get what I want while spending as little time and money as possible?” Look: being efficient with your time and money is a worthwhile goal, but if you’re trying to learn English and your starting point is: “How do I do this cheaply and without spending much time?” then your chances of success are slim.",
  "Here’s the answer: if you don’t want to study English, then don’t.",
  "You don’t have to.",
  "If you really don’t want to, then you probably won’t learn much anyway.",
  "So, what should you say instead?.",
  "Instead, ask “What’s the next step if I want to…?” “What’s the next step if I want to get band seven in IELTS?” “What’s the next step if I want to improve my speaking?” “What’s the next step if I want to stop making so many grammar mistakes?” Again, these questions focus you on the present and encourage you to take action now.",
  "This increases your chances of making progress.",
  "Stop saying “I can’t.” Don’t say “I can’t speak fluently.” Don’t say “I can’t understand films and TV in English.” Don’t say “I can’t write without making mistakes.” Instead, ask yourself “Why?” “Why can’t I speak fluently?” “Why can’t I understand films and TV in English?” “Why do I make so many mistakes when I write?” There’s a reason.",
  "There’s an answer to all these questions.",
  "If you want to learn, you need to find the answer.",
  "There might not just be *one* answer, there could be many.",
  "The answer might not be simple.",
  "In fact, it almost certainly won’t be.",
  "But, finding an answer is the first step.",
  "Why can’t you speak fluently?.",
  "Maybe you don’t get enough opportunities to speak English.",
  "Maybe you live 99% of your life speaking and thinking in your native language.",
  "Maybe you lack vocabulary.",
  "Maybe your pronunciation needs work.",
  "Maybe something else.",
  "I don’t know.",
  "Remember: every learner is a little bit different!.",
  "You need to find the answer for you.",
  "Thinking this way will encourage you to take action and do something now.",
  "Saying “I can’t…” all the time just makes you feel bad.",
  "Find out why, then do something about it.",
  "Stop saying “I want...” Stop saying “I need…” Don’t say “I want to improve my speaking.” Don’t say “I want to have a bigger vocabulary.” Don’t say “I need to get band six point five in IELTS.” Often, when English learners say, “I want…” or “I need…”, there’s a second meaning.",
  "It’s not bad to have goals or to want things.",
  "But, if you say this, is this all you mean?.",
  "Many people who say these things really mean “I want *someone else* to give this to me.” I want *someone else* to solve this problem.",
  "I want *someone else* to wave a magic wand and get me my IELTS result.",
  "I want *someone else* to take away all the bad feelings and the hard work and the difficulties.",
  "It doesn’t work like that, and it’s never going to.",
  "You heard this before, but I’ll say it again: you don’t have to learn English!.",
  "But, but, but… I need it for my job.",
  "I have to learn English to emigrate to Australia.",
  "I have to learn English for my exams at university.",
  "No, you don’t.",
  "No one’s forcing you to learn English.",
  "You want to, or you don’t.",
  "If you want to, then do it.",
  "If you don’t, then save your time, your money and your energy.",
  "And, for sure, no one else will make it happen for you.",
  "Other people can help.",
  "Good teachers can help.",
  "English-speaking friends and colleagues can help.",
  "But, in the end, it depends on you.",
  "So, don’t say “I want…” or “I need…” if what you really mean is “I want someone else to give me the solution.” Don’t wait for someone else to solve your problems.",
  "Take responsibility for your own progress.",
  "I’m not saying that to be unkind.",
  "I’m saying it because you’re the only person who can.",
  "That’s it.",
  "Thanks for watching!.",

  "How to Summarise a Text in English - Improve English Comprehension.",
  "Hi, I’m Oli.",
  "Welcome to Oxford Online English!.",
  "In this lesson, you can learn how to read and summarise a text.",
  "Summarising a text is a vital skill for your English reading.",
  "If you can’t make a short, clear summary of the main ideas of a text, then you almost certainly haven’t understood it fully.",
  "Understanding what you read in English isn’t just about the words; it’s about understanding the ideas, how they’re organised, and which ideas are more or less important.",
  "Here, you’ll see some strategies you can use to improve your English reading, read faster, and improve your reading comprehension.",
  "Before we begin, check out our website: Oxford Online English dot com.",
  "Do you want to see a range of video and listening lessons to improve your English, all 100% free?.",
  "We have that!.",
  "Do you want to take online classes with a professional teacher?.",
  "We can do that, too!.",
  "Oxford Online English dot com.",
  "In this lesson, we’ll work with a sample text.",
  "You’ll see it in the video, but you can also find it on the full version of this lesson, which is on our website.",
  "You can find a link in the video description.",
  "We recommend reading it before you continue watching.",
  "Now, let’s look at the most important reading strategy you need to use.",
  "To understand and summarise a text, you need to find the main idea.",
  "Every coherent text has one central idea, which connects the different parts of the text.",
  "You need to know what this is.",
  "But, every text is different, and there isn’t one way to find the main idea.",
  "Instead, you need to look at the whole thing.",
  "Here are some things you should look at: One: is there a title or headings?.",
  "These will often highlight the most important points.",
  "Two: what is the first sentence about?.",
  "Often, the first sentence of a text or paragraph will summarise the main ideas.",
  "Three: what does most of the text talk about?.",
  "Look at each sentence and paragraph.",
  "Is there a single topic which connects them?.",
  "Look at our sample text and think about these questions.",
  "Pause the video if you need more reading time, and remember that you can also read it on our website—just follow the link in the video description.",
  "So, what do you think the main idea of our sample text is?.",
  "We’ll show you three possible summaries.",
  "Which do you think is best?.",
  "What do you think?.",
  "The best is number three.",
  "Let’s see why.",
  "First, you should look at the title.",
  "The title tells you that the text will be about Guugu Yimithirr, but it also mentions that this language is ‘unusual’. You should immediately focus on this word, because it shows that this language is different in some way.",
  "Also, ‘unusual’ could mean many things.",
  "What does it mean here?.",
  "Unusual how?.",
  "Second, what’s the first sentence about?.",
  "Here, it gives background information.",
  "It doesn’t help you to find the main idea.",
  "That’s OK—in this case, the background information is helpful, because most people don’t know what Guugu Yimithirr is.",
  "Third, what does most of the text talk about?.",
  "Apart from the first sentence, every sentence is about the same topic: the fact that Guugu Yimithirr uses compass directions—north, south, east, west—for all directions, because there are no words for ‘left’, ‘right’, and so on.",
  "This answers the question you found in the title: why is this language unusual?.",
  "Now you have a reason.",
  "However, analysing the text in this way is complex, and there are other sub-skills you might need.",
  "Let’s look at an important example.",
  "To summarise a text, you need to find which ideas are general, and which are details or examples.",
  "The general ideas will give you the overall meaning.",
  "If you confuse general ideas and details, you might misunderstand the overall meaning what you’re reading.",
  "Unfortunately, there are no clear markers which show you what’s general or not.",
  "A single sentence might mix general ideas and details together.",
  "You need to use context and other clues to work out which ideas are general and which are details.",
  "Look at five extracts from our sample text.",
  "What do you think?.",
  "Are these general ideas, or details?.",
  "Which do you need to understand in order to find the overall meaning?.",
  "Sentences one, three and four are general.",
  "Two and five are details.",
  "One is general because it introduces the topic by giving background information.",
  "This is like a topic sentence, which tells you what the rest of the text will be about.",
  "Two is a detail.",
  "It’s more background information; you don’t need it to understand the overall meaning.",
  "Three is a general, important idea.",
  "This sentence highlights the unusual feature of the Guugu Yimithirr language.",
  "The rest of the text expands on the idea introduced in this sentence.",
  "We said that four is general; however, it’s kind of in the middle.",
  "It explains the exact meaning of ‘lacking egocentric directions’ which is referred to in sentence three.",
  "Technically, this sentence isn’t necessary to understand the main idea.",
  "On the other hand, most people—including educated native English speakers—wouldn’t know what ‘egocentric directions’ are.",
  "This sentence explains it, and so it *is* important for understanding the whole text.",
  "Five is a detail.",
  "It adds an example of how Guugu Yimithirr speakers talk about position and direction, but it isn’t necessary to understand the main idea.",
  "So, what do you need to focus on here?.",
  "First, it’s a good idea to skim a text first, reading fast and trying to understand the overall idea in a simple way.",
  "In order to separate general ideas from details, you need some context.",
  "Until you’ve read the whole thing, you won’t have this.",
  "Second, look for linking phrases like ‘for example’, ‘for instance’, ‘specifically’ or ‘in particular.’ Linking phrases like these show you that what follows is an explanation of a more general idea that was mentioned before.",
  "Third, remember that one sentence can contain both general ideas and details mixed together.",
  "For example, this sentence contains both a detail—about the word ‘kangaroo’—and a general point.",
  "Now, why not do some more practice?.",
  "Look at the rest of our sample text.",
  "Which ideas are general?.",
  "Which ideas are details?.",
  "Pause the video and try it now, if you want.",
  "Did you do it?.",
  "Here’s a shorter version, with all examples and details removed.",
  "If you can do this, you’ll be able to read much faster.",
  "Why?.",
  "Because you only need to focus on the general ideas to understand the overall meaning.",
  "Here, you only need to understand 76 words, instead of 230.",
  "This saves you time, which could be helpful if you are under time pressure, like in an IELTS reading exam.",
  "There’s another related, skill which can help you to understand a text.",
  "Let’s look!.",
  "If you’re a non-native speaker reading in English, you’ll probably have this problem often: there are words which you don’t understand.",
  "Maybe there are several words which you don’t know.",
  "Don’t panic!.",
  "This makes things more difficult, but there are strategies you can use.",
  "First, look for proper nouns, which start with a capital letter.",
  "Sometimes, we see that students think they don’t understand a word, but they don’t realise that the ‘word’ is actually a proper noun, like a person’s name, or a place name.",
  "Can you find three examples of proper nouns in our text?.",
  "Pause the video if you want time to think about it.",
  "You could say ‘Guugu Yimithirr’, ‘Queensland’, ‘Hopevale’, ‘English’ or ‘Brisbane’. Generally, if a proper noun is important or not widely-understood, it will be explained.",
  "For example, ‘Guugu Yimithirr’ is obviously important, and it’s explained in the first sentence.",
  "If a proper noun isn’t explained, you can usually ignore it, or try to work out the meaning from the context.",
  "For example, look at the first sentence.",
  "Even if you’ve never heard of Queensland or Hopevale, you can work out that they’re place names.",
  "Next, look for words that tell you that an idea is important.",
  "You could look for words like ‘important’, ‘notable’, ‘significant’ or ‘essential’. For example, you saw this sentence.",
  "The word ‘notable’ highlights something important about the language.",
  "This means you should focus on this sentence.",
  "If you’re under time pressure, you should spend extra time on this sentence.",
  "Also, look for words which were also used in the title, or possibly which appeared in the first sentence or paragraph.",
  "Remember that writers might use paraphrase, so you might not find the exact same words.",
  "There was a key word from the title used in the text.",
  "Do you know where?.",
  "Pause the video if you want time to find it!.",
  "The word ‘unusual’ appears in this sentence.",
  "You heard before that ‘unusual’ is a key word in the title.",
  "So, when you see it, you should pay extra attention to this sentence.",
  "In fact, this sentence gives you one of the key general ideas.",
  "Depending on your situation, you might have different options to deal with unknown words.",
  "If you have unlimited time, unlimited patience and access to a dictionary, then you can check the meaning of every word.",
  "However, this strategy is not possible in most cases.",
  "No one really has unlimited time or unlimited patience.",
  "Plus, there are often restrictions; if you’re taking an exam, you’ll have a time limit and you probably won’t be able to use a dictionary.",
  "This is why it’s important to focus on the general ideas, and then find key words within them.",
  "If there are 50 words you don’t know, that’s difficult to deal with.",
  "However, if you can focus on a smaller number of more important sentences, there will be fewer unknown words.",
  "At this point, you should know how to read and summarise a text in English.",
  "We have a challenge for you!.",
  "On the full version of this lesson, which is on our website, you’ll find a second text to practise with.",
  "If you’re watching on YouTube, you can find a link in the video description.",
  "Can you write a summary of the second text?.",
  "Your summary should be maximum two sentences, or ideally just one.",
  "Use the reading techniques you saw in this lesson.",
  "Post your suggestion in the comments, and read other people’s ideas.",
  "Thanks for watching!.",
  "See you next time!.",

  "4 Steps to English Success - Improve Your Motivation to Study English.",
  "Hi, I’m Oli.",
  "Welcome to Oxford Online English!.",
  "In this lesson, we’re going to talk about motivation in English learning.",
  "You’re going to hear some tips for how to manage your motivation and get better results from your English studies.",
  "Before we start the lesson, don’t forget to check out our website: Oxford Online English dot com.",
  "We have free materials to help you practise your English, and you can also study in online classes with one of our professional English teachers!.",
  "But now, let’s look at some important ideas about what ‘motivation’ means.",
  "Idea number one: motivation isn’t something you can just decide to have.",
  "It’s not like an on/off switch inside you, which you can just flip from ‘off’ to ‘on’ if you find the right trick.",
  "Instead, motivation is a *consequence*. It’s a consequence of your life goals, your values, your environment and your lifestyle.",
  "You can’t decide to change your motivation directly, but you can change other things in your life which influence your motivation.",
  "Idea number two: real motivation is deep motivation.",
  "If you struggle to find the motivation to study English, then that’s a deep problem.",
  "There’s also ‘fake’ motivation.",
  "This is the kind of motivation which makes people join a gym and pay for a year’s membership on January the 2nd, and then go once or twice in the whole year.",
  "This isn’t real motivation.",
  "Often, fake motivation comes from other people, but it disappears as quickly as it arrives.",
  "Real motivation is deep motivation; it comes from inside, and it takes time and work to develop.",
  "Most importantly, idea number three: it’s hard to develop and maintain motivation, but it’s easy to kill it.",
  "Lots of things can kill your motivation: a bad teacher, a busy job, a newborn baby who doesn’t sleep well, financial worries, video game addiction, and many more.",
  "So, you have to look after your motivation carefully.",
  "You need to think about many aspects of your life, not just study-related questions.",
  "You’ll learn about these points in more detail over the rest of this lesson.",
  "Let’s move on.",
  "We won’t spend long on this section.",
  "Why not?.",
  "Because we already made a whole video about it!.",
  "You should watch it, if you haven’t already.",
  "Remember that it’s easy to kill your motivation.",
  "Not knowing how to set study goals is one of the best ways to kill your motivation to learn English.",
  "If you set yourself goals like, ‘I want to speak like a native speaker,’ or, ‘I want to speak English perfectly,’ this will kill your motivation.",
  "Where do you start with goals like these?.",
  "What’s the first step?.",
  "How do you know when you’ve finished?.",
  "There are no answers to these questions, which is why these goals are no good for you.",
  "You need to set goals which are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and timebound: SMART goals.",
  "We’ll give you one more idea here which we didn’t mention in the SMART goals video.",
  "Don’t compare yourself to native speakers; don’t aim to speak perfect English; instead, just ask yourself one question: how can I improve?.",
  "This is how I approach teaching, by the way.",
  "This is the question that’s in my head when I meet a new student: how can I make this person’s English better?.",
  "Students come to me with all sorts of goals; they have different budgets, and different amounts of time they want to spend on studying.",
  "They’re starting at different levels.",
  "Some people are ambitious; others just want to learn one or two simple points.",
  "With each person, there are different possibilities.",
  "I don’t worry about those things; I just ask myself: what can I do to make this person’s English better?.",
  "You can benefit from thinking in the same way.",
  "This idea makes things simpler, and it helps you to focus on specific, concrete steps to learn and improve.",
  "Guess what: that’s good for your motivation!.",
  "Overall, nothing is better for your motivation than feeling like you’re making progress.",
  "If you can feel that you’re improving, you’ll feel more motivated to continue studying.",
  "Setting good goals is vital to keep your motivation alive and healthy.",
  "However, there’s another point which is equally important.",
  "Your motivation depends greatly on your environment.",
  "This means: where you live, where you work, what kind of work you do, who you talk to every day, how you spend your free time, and so on.",
  "Let’s take two examples.",
  "Imagine two people.",
  "We’ll call them Sam and Alex.",
  "They’re not real, but the ideas are similar to many students we’ve met.",
  "Sam lives in Amsterdam.",
  "She doesn’t speak Dutch, so she mostly uses English in her day-to-day life.",
  "She works in a software firm, where all office communication is in English.",
  "She regularly attends meetings, participates in conference calls, and gives presentations in English.",
  "Outside of work, most of her friends are expats from other countries.",
  "Their common language is English, so most of the time, Sam speaks English outside of work, too.",
  "She only speaks her native language with one or two friends, or when she calls her family and friends back home.",
  "Alex lives in Taipei.",
  "He speaks intermediate-level English, but he rarely uses it in his daily life.",
  "He works for the marketing department of a large company, and most of his day-to-day work is in Mandarin or Taiwanese.",
  "At home and with his friends, he mostly speaks Taiwanese.",
  "He goes to English classes twice a week because he wants to improve; he has a dream of studying in Australia or the UK, but he knows that his English level isn’t high enough.",
  "He often feels too tired to study, or that he doesn’t have enough spare time.",
  "Besides, he feels like studying doesn’t make any difference to his English level.",
  "He feels frustrated because his progress is slow.",
  "What do you think?.",
  "Do these stories sound familiar to you?.",
  "Are you more like Sam, or more like Alex?.",
  "Remember: these aren’t real people!.",
  "However, I think Alex’s situation will sound familiar to many of you.",
  "We meet and hear from *so many* English learners who are in this situation.",
  "Here’s another question: what can Alex do to feel more motivated?.",
  "How can he deal with these feelings of frustration?.",
  "Short answer: he can’t, or at least, not easily.",
  "That might sound like a demotivational answer!.",
  "We’re not trying to kill your motivation, of course, but you need to understand what you can and can’t do to make a difference if you’re in the same situation.",
  "Here’s the problem: Alex lives in an environment where he doesn’t need to use English.",
  "Sure, he has his dream of studying abroad, but for most people, future dreams aren’t enough.",
  "You need something *now*—or at least, in the near future—which gives you motivation.",
  "Alex doesn’t have that.",
  "There’s nothing in his life *now* which means he needs to improve his English.",
  "That limits his motivation.",
  "He feels like he’s too busy or too tired to study.",
  "When you say you’re ‘too busy’ or ‘too tired’, that means you don’t have enough motivation.",
  "When you care about something, you find the time; you find the energy.",
  "When Alex says he’s too busy, he really means that it’s not a high enough priority.",
  "When you say you’re too tired to study or practise, you’re saying it’s not a high enough priority.",
  "Alex’s environment limits his motivation, and his motivation limits his potential progress.",
  "Not making progress hurts his motivation even more.",
  "Over time, nothing changes.",
  "He spends time and money on English courses, but his situation doesn’t change in any meaningful way.",
  "Motivation won’t just appear out of thin air.",
  "He needs to change something.",
  "If you’re in Alex’s position, you need to change something.",
  "You need to give yourself something *now* or in the near future which means that you *need* English.",
  "You need something which is a central part of your life, and which you cannot do without English.",
  "Let’s think about Sam for a moment.",
  "Sam doesn’t have these problems, because if she did, she couldn’t live her life.",
  "She couldn’t do her job or talk to her friends if her English wasn’t good enough.",
  "So, if her English was weak in some areas, she would fix those problems.",
  "She would find a solution.",
  "Maybe she’d do it herself, maybe she’d ask a friend, or maybe she’d study with a teacher.",
  "It doesn’t matter; she *would* find a solution, because she has to.",
  "Let’s think about you.",
  "What does this mean for you?.",
  "It means two things, and neither of them is easy.",
  "One: if this is your problem, then you need to change your environment.",
  "You need to make changes in where you live, or where you work, or how you spend your free time, so that you need English in your day-to-day life.",
  "I know that a lot of you are thinking, “Great advice, guys!.",
  "I can’t just move to another country!.",
  "I can’t just get a job in a multinational company!” Yeah, I know.",
  "It’s not easy, but you need to do something.",
  "Start small: try to find expat groups or social activities in your city where there are English-speaking foreigners.",
  "If you work for a company which sometimes deals with foreign clients, ask your manager if there’s a way for you to be involved.",
  "We can’t tell you exactly what to do, because you have your life, and everyone watching this will have different possibilities.",
  "All we can say is: you need to do something, and if you have no idea what to do, start with something small.",
  "We said there are two things you need to think about.",
  "What’s the second?.",
  "Two: you need to take risks.",
  "That means that you put yourself in a situation where you might fail, and that failure might hurt.",
  "Think about Sam and Alex again.",
  "Sam cannot live her life if her English isn’t good enough.",
  "She’ll lose her job and she’ll struggle in social situations.",
  "For Alex, there are no consequences if he doesn’t make progress.",
  "He just stays in the same place.",
  "Maybe he’s unhappy with that, but for most people, that’s not enough to give you motivation.",
  "You need to take risks.",
  "That means things like talking to people when you’re nervous or uncomfortable, moving to a new city, or volunteering to make an important presentation at work in English.",
  "And again, we know this isn’t easy.",
  "But, it’s necessary.",
  "If you live in a way that means you don’t need to improve your English right now, then you’ll probably struggle to find the motivation to study and practise.",
  "You need to put yourself in an environment where you need English, and where failure to improve is painful.",
  "‘Painful’ means that your life is more difficult and more limited if you’re not getting better.",
  "We know a lot of people watching this are going to say, ‘I can’t…’ ‘I can’t make changes…’ ‘It’s too difficult…’ Maybe.",
  "Maybe not.",
  "I don’t know the details of your life.",
  "I don’t know what’s possible or not for you.",
  "Just remember: your environment limits your motivation, and your motivation limits your progress.",
  "There’s no way around that.",
  "Finally, let’s talk about one more thing you need to know.",
  "Up to now, we’ve talked about developing and building your motivation, about how to feel more motivated to study and improve your English.",
  "We’re going to tell you something which might sound strange, but it’s just as important: your motivation is always limited.",
  "You’ll get better results—and be happier—if you understand this.",
  "Here’s a question: how long can you sit and study by yourself before you get bored and you find it difficult to concentrate?.",
  "Half an hour?.",
  "An hour?.",
  "Two?.",
  "What if you have to study every day for a month?.",
  "Could you still do the same amount?.",
  "How long can you spend in an English class before you start to feel bored and you want to do something else?.",
  "How long can you spend speaking English before you feel tired and you have an urge to speak your own language?.",
  "You’ll all have different answers, but all of you watching this will have a limit.",
  "Your limit might be lower or higher, but it’s there.",
  "These limits control how much time you can spend working on your English.",
  "You can try forcing yourself to study when you’re bored, but it’s not effective.",
  "If it works, it only works for a short time.",
  "That’s because feeling bored is your brain’s way of saying to you: “This isn’t important enough to spend our time on!” Remember: motivation isn’t something you can just decide to have.",
  "You have a certain amount of motivation, and you need to decide how you use it.",
  "Don’t be hard on yourself.",
  "Feeling bored is natural, and everyone has their limits!.",
  "But, it means that you need to set clear goals, as we talked about before.",
  "Also, you need to set priorities based on the time and energy you have available.",
  "If you can study for thirty minutes before you start getting bored, you need to think: what can you do in thirty minutes which will help you the most?.",
  "Many English learners overestimate their motivation, and set goals which they don’t actually have the motivation to achieve.",
  "We’ve met so many students who say they want to study for hours every day, but most of them give up quickly, because they don’t have enough motivation to do the things they say they want to do.",
  "You can see this from the other side, too.",
  "If you can speak in English for half an hour before your concentration starts to fade, then ask yourself: how can you have a 30-minute conversation in English every day or most days?.",
  "Who can you talk to?.",
  "You have enough motivation and the energy to do this, so you should try to use that.",
  "How do you manage your motivation when studying English?.",
  "Have you experienced the things we’ve talked about in this lesson?.",
  "If so, please let us know in the comments; we’d love to hear your ideas!.",
  "Thanks for watching!.",
  "See you next time!.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XetCUeQE9xw&list=PLD6t6ckHsrubBcsZpswXuda0Hi2m_GJ8U&index=14\">See you next time!</a>",
  "Improve English Study Habits with High and Low-Intensity Practice.",
  "Hi, I’m Kasia.",
  "Welcome to Oxford Online English!.",
  "Here’s a question: do you want to improve your English vocabulary, or learn to understand native speakers better?.",
  "Of course you do!.",
  "In this lesson, you’ll see a study technique which can help you to learn English more efficiently, and make real, deep progress over time.",
  "You’ll see a mistake which many English learners make, and how you can avoid it.",
  "Before we start, don’t forget to check out our website: Oxford Online English dot com.",
  "Do you need English classes?.",
  "We have many professional English teachers, with many years of experience, who you can study with in online classes.",
  "Even if you’re not interested in this, you can also find many free English lessons, including videos and listening lessons.",
  "But now, let’s get back to the question you heard before.",
  "How can you improve your English over time?.",
  "How can you make real progress, so that you don’t keep forgetting and relearning the same things?.",
  "The solution is not easy or fast, but it is simple: read more and listen more in English.",
  "Reading and listening in English regularly are essential if you want to improve your English skills.",
  "OK, you say, but what about my speaking?.",
  "What about my writing?.",
  "I need to learn to speak in English!.",
  "Fine, but where will your vocabulary come from?.",
  "Where will your sentence structure come from?.",
  "These building blocks of language don’t come from nowhere.",
  "They come from things you read or hear.",
  "The more you read and listen, the more tools you’ll have when you’re speaking or writing.",
  "But, many English learners don’t read or listen enough.",
  "Sometimes, they say things like: “It’s too difficult to read in English.” “There are too many unknown words!” “It’s too tiring!.",
  "I get bored!” You’re going to see an idea to help you deal with these problems, so you can take control of your study habits, and make real, deep improvements to your English over time.",
  "When you read or listen, especially in a foreign language, there are two basic approaches you can take.",
  "Let’s call them “high-intensity practice” and “low-intensity practice.” What do we mean here?.",
  "High-intensity practice means you give 100% of your focus.",
  "If you’re reading or listening, you try to understand as much as you can.",
  "You repeat the same task several times.",
  "Low-intensity means that you relax.",
  "You don’t worry about understanding everything.",
  "You do as much as you want.",
  "So, what’s the big deal?.",
  "Why think about this?.",
  "To improve, you need to read and listen regularly.",
  "You also need a balance between high-intensity and low-intensity practice.",
  "This is where many English learners make mistakes.",
  "They don’t get the balance between these types of practice right, and this affects their results.",
  "If you do too much high-intensity practice, you’ll burn out.",
  "You’ll get tired and bored; you won’t be able to motivate yourself to study and practise regularly.",
  "Then, you won’t spend enough time practising, and you’ll struggle to improve.",
  "On the other hand, if all your practice is low-intensity, you also won’t improve much.",
  "You won’t learn a lot from your reading or listening.",
  "Again, in the long term, this leads to frustration and loss of motivation.",
  "In the rest of this lesson, you’ll see how to apply these ideas to your English reading and listening practice, and how to find the right balance between high-intensity and low-intensity practice.",
  "You’ll also see how to make a sample study plan to maximise the results you get from your English study time.",
  "First, let’s talk about listening.",
  "Think about four different ways to practice listening.",
  "One: you watch a film in English, with English subtitles.",
  "You don’t pause it or check words which you don’t know.",
  "Two: you watch fifteen minutes of a film in English, without subtitles.",
  "You pause and rewind to re-listen to sections.",
  "You use a dictionary to check words which you don’t know.",
  "Afterwards, you watch the same section again, with subtitles, so that you can check what you heard.",
  "Three: you listen to a podcast or radio station in English while you’re working, or maybe while you’re doing some housework.",
  "You’re concentrating on what you’re doing, so you aren’t really listening most of the time.",
  "Four: you do an IELTS listening exam.",
  "You check your answers and give yourself a score.",
  "We’ll ask: which are high-intensity and which are low-intensity ways to practise?.",
  "Hopefully, the answer is obvious.",
  "One and three are low-intensity ways to practise; two and four are high-intensity.",
  "When you’re listening to something in English, what does high-intensity practice mean?.",
  "It means: you focus 100% on what you’re listening to, you try to understand as much as possible, you use a dictionary to check new words, and you also repeat the same task at least twice, or possibly more.",
  "High-intensity practice should also include feedback; you should be able to check if you understood what you heard correctly or not.",
  "In example number two, above, you do this by rewatching the clip with subtitles.",
  "You use the subtitles to check if you heard everything correctly.",
  "In example number four, you get feedback by checking your answers against the answer key.",
  "This is a key part of high-intensity listening practice.",
  "There should always be feedback.",
  "You need a way to check if you heard correctly or not.",
  "There’s one more important difference: high-intensity practice is time-limited.",
  "You aren’t trying to watch a whole film; you’re working on a 15-minute clip.",
  "Obviously, IELTS exams are also time-limited.",
  "By contrast, low-intensity practice can go on for any length of time.",
  "If you’re listening to podcasts while you’re cleaning your house, you can go on listening for as long as you want.",
  "What about low-intensity practice?.",
  "What does this look like?.",
  "Remember the criteria for high-intensity practice.",
  "What were they?.",
  "100% focus, try to understand as much as possible, use a dictionary, repeat the same task, and get feedback.",
  "If you’re not doing these things, then it’s low-intensity practice.",
  "Now, can you think of other examples of high-intensity listening practice and low-intensity listening practice?.",
  "Remember: both sides are useful!.",
  "Pause the video now and think about your ideas.",
  "Try to get three methods for high-intensity practice, and three for low-intensity.",
  "So, what did you get?.",
  "There are many possibilities, but here are three suggestions for high-intensity practice: One: listen to a song twice, trying to hear the words.",
  "Then, listen with the lyrics, check any words you don’t know in a dictionary, then listen again.",
  "Two: do listening exercises from an English textbook.",
  "Three: do a conversation class with an English teacher, so you have to understand and respond to the teacher’s ideas.",
  "What about you?.",
  "Did you get similar ideas, or different?.",
  "By the way, please put your suggestions in the comments and share them with other learners!.",
  "Next, what about low-intensity practice?.",
  "Here are three ideas: One: make a playlist of English songs, and listen to it regularly, for example in your car, or while you’re on the bus or the subway going to work.",
  "Two: watch an English TV series with English subtitles, without worrying about whether you understand everything or not.",
  "Three: listen to English-language radio while you’re working.",
  "Often, low-intensity practice means you listen to something in English while you’re doing something else.",
  "That’s valuable, because you don’t need to make time for this kind of practice—you can combine it with other things.",
  "Now, you should have some ideas about high-intensity and low-intensity listening practice.",
  "What about reading?.",
  "A question: what does high-intensity reading practice look like?.",
  "What about low-intensity reading practice?.",
  "You can answer this with many of the same ideas you heard about listening practice.",
  "High-intensity reading practice means: you read everything carefully, you read sentences and whole texts several times, and you use a dictionary.",
  "Low-intensity reading practice means you don’t do these things: you read something once, you don’t worry about unknown words, you don’t worry about whether you’ve understood everything or not, and you use a dictionary little or not at all.",
  "So, is there a difference between high-intensity and low-intensity practice in reading and listening?.",
  "There are two small differences.",
  "First, you need feedback for high-intensity listening practice, to check if you’ve heard things correctly or not.",
  "When you’re reading, you can see the words, so this is less important.",
  "Second, you can do low-intensity listening practice while you’re doing something else.",
  "You can’t do this with reading.",
  "You need to make time for all reading practice, including low-intensity reading.",
  "Let’s think about another question: should you choose different things to read for different types of practice?.",
  "Or, should you read the same things whether you’re doing high-intensity or low-intensity training?.",
  "What do you think?.",
  "Probably, you should read different things.",
  "When you do high-intensity practice, you should read something that’s challenging, something right on the edge of what’s possible for you.",
  "On the other hand, for low-intensity practice, you should read something that’s relatively easy, so you don’t need to focus too hard.",
  "Want an idea?.",
  "Read children’s books, or comic books.",
  "A lot of learners we talk to are against this, because they think it’s childish or unhelpful, but we disagree!.",
  "Children’s books can really help your reading, especially if your English level is lower.",
  "In any case, find something you can read without much effort, so that you have something you can use for low-intensity practice.",
  "What about you?.",
  "What would you do for high-intensity and low-intensity reading practice?.",
  "Again, please share your ideas in the comments.",
  "Maybe you’ll get some good tips from other viewers!.",
  "Next, let’s see how you can use these ideas to make an effective, realistic study plan to improve your English.",
  "Let’s start with some basic points.",
  "First, you need to make time for high-intensity listening practice, and both high-intensity and low-intensity reading practice.",
  "Second, you need to think of ways to get as much low-intensity listening practice as possible.",
  "Remember that you can do this while you’re doing something else.",
  "Third, you need a good balance of high-intensity and low-intensity practice.",
  "What does this mean?.",
  "You need some high-intensity practice, ideally a little bit every day, but not too much!.",
  "High-intensity practice is tiring and probably not fun.",
  "You need to concentrate hard.",
  "It’s work.",
  "So, schedule high-intensity practice for your best time of day.",
  "Are you a morning person?.",
  "Do it as soon as possible after you wake up.",
  "Are you a night owl?.",
  "Schedule your practice late in the evening.",
  "Set a time limit for high-intensity practice.",
  "This will help you to focus.",
  "Start with fifteen minutes, and then increase it slowly if you think this is too little.",
  "For low-intensity practice, do as much as possible.",
  "A good way to do this: take things you do every day in your language, and replace them with English.",
  "For example, do you read the news every day, maybe while you’re having breakfast?.",
  "Read the news in English, instead.",
  "Do you listen to podcasts while you’re walking around?.",
  "Listen to English podcasts, instead.",
  "Remember: low-intensity practice shouldn’t be stressful.",
  "It shouldn’t be hard to motivate yourself to do it.",
  "The idea is to expose yourself to as much English as possible.",
  "That’s it.",
  "Don’t try to do more.",
  "Keep high-intensity and low-intensity practice separate.",
  "Here’s a possible study plan for one day: High-intensity listening: watch a 5-minute clip from a TV show, like Friends.",
  "Watch once without subtitles, then again with subtitles, and check any new words in the dictionary.",
  "Watch a third time to ‘fix’ the new vocabulary in your head.",
  "Low-intensity listening: put a playlist of English videos on in the background while making dinner.",
  "High-intensity reading: read a short news article on a technical topic.",
  "Read once, check new vocabulary, then read again.",
  "Low-intensity reading: browse the comments under a news article on a topic you’re interested in.",
  "What do you think?.",
  "Would this be realistic for you?.",
  "The high-intensity parts here should take maybe 10-20 minutes each.",
  "The low-intensity reading can take as little or as long as you want.",
  "That means you need maybe one hour a day total.",
  "It also means you don’t need to sit at a desk and study for hours.",
  "You need to focus for maybe 20 minutes at a time.",
  "That’s not so bad, right?.",
  "Could you do this?.",
  "If you could follow a study plan like this regularly, your English will get better over time.",
  "Of course, you should give yourself different things to do at least some days, and you probably won’t be able to do this seven days a week, 365 days a year.",
  "But, maybe you can do it three days a week, or four.",
  "Maybe even five!.",
  "This will still help you.",
  "Make a realistic study plan, and don’t get discouraged if you don’t stick to it perfectly.",
  "Do as much as you can, as often as you can.",
  "What about you?.",
  "Could you make a study plan for yourself using these ideas?.",
  "Think about your English level, your interests, and what’s easy or difficult for you.",
  "If you want, share your daily study plan in the comments.",
  "Sharing your ideas might help other learners, and you can also get tips from other people!.",
  "Thanks for watching!.",
  "See you next time!."
