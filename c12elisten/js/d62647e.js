  "Speak English Fluently - 5 Steps to Improve Your English Fluency Hi, I’m Oli.",
  "Welcome to Oxford Online English!.",
  "In this lesson, you can learn how to speak more fluently in English.",
  "How long have you been studying English?.",
  "Do you find that sometimes that even though you study hard, you can’t speak fluently?.",
  "Do you learn lots of grammar and vocabulary, but you find it difficult to make sentences when you speak.",
  "In this lesson, we’re going to talk about fluency and what you can do to change this situation and improve your English fluency.",
  "Part one: what is fluency?.",
  "Sometimes, when people talk about fluency, they just mean speaking a language well.",
  "For some people, speaking English fluently just means having a good general level of English.",
  "However, fluency is more specific than that.",
  "Fluency means you can speak smoothly, without stopping or hesitating.",
  "There are two sides to fluency.",
  "One side is physical: your mouth needs to produce and connect English sounds and words in a fast, smooth way.",
  "The other side of fluency is mental: your brain needs to find the right words and build English sentences quickly and smoothly.",
  "To improve your fluency, you need to work on both sides: physical and mental.",
  "But first… Part two: rule number one: get out there!.",
  "There are many things you can do to improve your English fluency.",
  "However, if you want to become more fluent, there’s really one thing you have to do.",
  "Get out there and speak English.",
  "Talk to people and have conversations regularly.",
  "Nothing else you can do is as important as this.",
  "Reading English will improve your reading.",
  "Practicing listening will improve your listening.",
  "But what about speaking?.",
  "Nothing will help your speaking except speaking.",
  "Speaking English is a practical skill.",
  "It’s not an academic subject; it’s not something you can learn from a book.",
  "It’s more like doing a sport or playing a musical instrument: you need to practice regularly to make any progress.",
  "How regularly?.",
  "As often as you can!.",
  "There’s no maximum, but I’d recommend you need to spend at least 2-3 hours a week speaking English if you want to improve.",
  "So, how can you do this?.",
  "Go to classes, talk to expats in your city, join groups or activities with English-speakers, find a conversation partner online, do a language exchange; there are many possibilities!.",
  "By the way, what you do doesn’t have to be language-focused.",
  "You can go to English classes to practice your speaking, but anything you do which is in English and which will make you speak English is just as good.",
  "I’m going to take a guess here about what many of you are thinking right now: “But I don’t have people to talk to”; “But I’m shy”; “But it’s too difficult.” Let’s talk about that quickly.",
  "Part three: get used to pressure.",
  "Speaking a foreign language is hard.",
  "Situations which would be easy in your language can feel difficult in another language.",
  "Situations which would feel difficult in your language can feel almost impossible when you have to do them in a foreign language.",
  "That’s how it is.",
  "It’s easy to imagine when you start learning another language that you will reach a point where everything is easy and comfortable.",
  "But unless you live in a foreign country and live completely inside that culture, that won’t happen.",
  "Trust me—I’ve studied several languages at this point in my life, and speak them quite well, but it never feels easy or comfortable.",
  "Why are we talking about this?.",
  "I’m trying to motivate you to go out and speak more, practice more.",
  "To do that, you have to accept that it will feel difficult, uncomfortable and intimidating a lot of the time.",
  "That’s how it is—don’t let it stop you!.",
  "You can still practice, you can still communicate, and you can still improve.",
  "I’ll give you an example of this from my own experience.",
  "I hate making phone calls in another language.",
  "I don’t know why, but I find it particularly intimidating.",
  "I guess because I can’t use context or facial expressions or anything like that to help me understand or communicate.",
  "I lived in Russia and I studied Russian.",
  "I hated making phone calls in Russian.",
  "Then I lived in China and I studied Chinese.",
  "I hated making phone calls in Chinese.",
  "Now I’m studying Greek.",
  "Guess what?.",
  "I hate making phone calls in Greek, too.",
  "It still feels just as difficult and just as intimidating.",
  "I haven’t learned any tricks to make it easier.",
  "All I’ve done is that I accept that this is how it feels.",
  "That’s it.",
  "I still do it, because I have to sometimes.",
  "I just accept that I’m going to feel nervous or uncomfortable, and I have to speak and communicate anyway.",
  "And I do!.",
  "It doesn't stop you.",
  "Feeling nervous does not stop you communicating.",
  "This will be the same for you sometimes.",
  "It might be phone calls; it might be something else.",
  "The key point?.",
  "You have to accept and learn to deal with that pressure.",
  "Don’t think: it feels scary, so I won’t do it.",
  "It won’t feel less scary in the future.",
  "The only way to make it easier is to go out and do it.",
  "If you do that, you'll feel more confident.",
  "It will get a little bit easier with time.",
  "Okay, so you know the most important point about fluency, but is there anything else you can do to practice?.",
  "Yes, there is!.",
  "Part four: speed reading.",
  "Find a text in English.",
  "It can be something from a textbook, from a newspaper, from a blog, or anywhere.",
  "The text should be fairly easy for you.",
  "Don’t choose something with a lot of new words or something which is way above your current English level.",
  "Sit down with a timer.",
  "Read the text aloud.",
  "Time yourself.",
  "Now, read it again.",
  "Try to beat your previous time!.",
  "Keep going like this.",
  "See how fast you can read the text.",
  "What’s this for?.",
  "Remember that part of fluency is physical.",
  "Your mouth needs to produce English sounds and English words fast and smoothly.",
  "Speed reading like this is a good way to practice that side of fluency.",
  "This way of practicing is really useful because you can do it almost anywhere and you can also do as much or as little as you have time for.",
  "You can do five minutes practice or fifteen minutes, or half an hour.",
  "It’s all helpful!.",
  "Let’s see another good technique like this: Part five: using songs.",
  "Find a song in English.",
  "Choose something which you like.",
  "Find the lyrics online.",
  "If you don’t know where to look, just put the song title and the word ‘lyrics’ into Google.",
  "You’ll find them.",
  "Play the song.",
  "Read the lyrics.",
  "Sing!.",
  "Like with speed reading, this is a good technique to practice the physical side of fluency.",
  "When you sing a song, you have to go at the speed of the song.",
  "Start with slower songs, then choose faster ones.",
  "Try to choose something that’s possible but challenging, so you can sing the song, but it’s difficult to go fast enough.",
  "Again, this will really help with your physical fluency.",
  "It’s also easy to do; you can do one song a day, and I promise you that you will feel a difference quite quickly.",
  "I used this technique a lot when I was learning Chinese, and it really helped.",
  "Speed reading and singing songs are good for physical fluency, but what about the mental side of fluency?.",
  "Let’s see what you can do to improve that.",
  "Part six: learn language in chunks.",
  "Here’s a question: how do you learn vocabulary?.",
  "When I see students learning vocabulary, often it looks like this.",
  "People write down the English word, the translation in their own language, and then they try to memorise it.",
  "Okay, but what does that have to do with fluency?.",
  "Think about it: if you learn language like this, you’re making your brain do things in a very unnatural and complicated way.",
  "First of all, you’re learning each word individually.",
  "But, when you speak a language, you don’t need individual words, you need phrases and sentences.",
  "Secondly, if you do this, you’re learning English through your own language.",
  "You’re not learning to speak English, you’re trying to learn to translate your language into English in your head.",
  "So, does this sound familiar?.",
  "You have a sentence in your head in your own language.",
  "You move through the sentence, translating each word into English.",
  "If you don’t know the translation of a word, you get stuck, you feel bad about your English, and you stop speaking.",
  "You need to break this habit if you want to speak fluently.",
  "First of all, this way of thinking and speaking is always slow.",
  "It will always be slow, because you’re trying to do too many things at once.",
  "You’re trying to think and remember things in two languages—it’s too difficult for anybody.",
  "So what can you do?.",
  "We said before that you need phrases and sentences when you speak.",
  "So, learn language in phrases and sentences.",
  "For example, imagine that someone asks you: \"What are you doing this weekend?\" Look at three answers: \"I’m going to see some old friends.\" \"I’m thinking of going for a bike ride.\" \"I might do some odd jobs around the house.\" Now, make your own sentences: \"I’m going to ________.\" \"I’m thinking of ________.\" \"I might ________.\" Try to make two or three sentences for each one, so that you use different endings.",
  "Now think: if someone asks you this question: \"What are you doing this weekend?\" If you remember language in big pieces, you only have to remember two things: \"(I’m going to) + (see some old friends).\" \"(I’m going to) + (have dinner with my family).\" \"(I’m going to) + (watch some old movies).\" That makes it easy to respond to questions like this fluently.",
  "On the other hand, if you make a sentence in your head in err... your language in your head, and then translate each word into English, it’s much more complicated.",
  "You don’t just have to remember two things; you have to remember many things.",
  "So, try to learn vocabulary in this way.",
  "Take a sentence like: \"I went for a walk yesterday.\" Keep the basic sentence form, but change part of it: \"I ________ yesterday.\" Now, make 2-3 different sentences: \"I took an exam yesterday.\" \"I was lazy all day yesterday.\" \"I cooked a spicy curry yesterday.\" Now, practice and remember the sentences and phrases.",
  "This is a much more natural way to learn vocabulary.",
  "If you learn vocabulary like this, it will be much easier to respond fluently, because you won’t need to think in your own language and translate.",
  "You’ll remember the whole phrases and sentences that you need.",
  "Okay, that’s the end of our lesson.",
  "I hope you learned something about spoken fluency and how you can improve your fluency in English!.",
  "You can find more free English lessons on our website: Oxford Online English dot com.",

  "5 Steps to Improve Your English Listening - How to Improve Your English Listening.",
  "Hi, I'm Kasia.",
  "Welcome to Oxford Online English.",
  "In this lesson, you’re going to learn how you can improve your English listening.",
  "You’ll see simple, effective tips that anyone can use to improve their English listening skills.",
  "We’ll also give you a practical, easy-to-follow study plan to help you improve your English listening fast.",
  "But first, let’s start with some questions.",
  "I’m going to ask you about four different situations where you would hear spoken English.",
  "You should think about whether understanding spoken English would be easy or difficult for you.",
  "OK?.",
  "First, you’re listening to an English teacher, speaking British English, speaking slowly and clearly.",
  "Easy or difficult?.",
  "Next, you’re listening to a native English speaker from Scotland, who speaks with a Scottish accent, and also uses a lot of slang and idiomatic English.",
  "What do you think: would this be easy or difficult for you?.",
  "Next, you’re on a train.",
  "There are four non-native speakers from four different countries talking to each other.",
  "They have different accents.",
  "Do you think you could understand their conversation?.",
  "Would it depend on where they were from?.",
  "Finally, you’re listening to a news show on the radio or as a podcast.",
  "There are many different speakers, and of course you can’t see them.",
  "They’re talking fast, using a lot of less common vocabulary, and changing topics often.",
  "How would you find this?.",
  "Probably, most of you think that the first situation is the easiest, and the last situation is the hardest.",
  "However, a lot depends on you and your experiences.",
  "The big question is: what can you do in those difficult situations?.",
  "You’ve been studying English for years, but you still can’t understand everything you hear.",
  "We get it—it’s frustrating!.",
  "So, what can you do?.",
  "Here’s a question: if you worry a lot about your English listening, will it make your English listening better?.",
  "No, of course not!.",
  "Many English learners get very stressed and anxious when they can’t understand something.",
  "This doesn’t help your English listening, and it can even make it more difficult to understand spoken English.",
  "To understand a foreign language, you need 100% of your brain power.",
  "\"Why can't I understand this?\" \"What was that word he just used?\" \"They're speaking too quickly!\" If you're worrying and thinking thoughts like this, you aren't concentrating on listening.",
  "You’re focusing on your own worries and thoughts, and not on what you’re hearing.",
  "This makes it harder to understand, not easier!.",
  "So, relax!.",
  "If you understand, you understand.",
  "If you don’t, you don't—it's not the end of the world!.",
  "By relaxing and focusing 100% on what you're hearing, you have the best chance to understand.",
  "[Portuguese audio] That’s Portuguese, if you didn’t know.",
  "I don’t know one word of Portuguese, so I can’t understand anything she’s saying.",
  "Is that a problem?.",
  "No.",
  "Am I worried or stressed?.",
  "No.",
  "If I listen carefully, I can hear a few words which sound a little familiar, so I could maybe guess the topic in a very general way.",
  "Take the same attitude when listening to English.",
  "If you don’t understand, there’s nothing you can do about it.",
  "So, relax!.",
  "Being relaxed and focused gives you the best chance to understand what you hear.",
  "Remember: you need 100% of your brain power to understand spoken English, or any foreign language.",
  "You know what takes a lot of brain power?.",
  "Translating English into your language!.",
  "So, you can’t do both.",
  "Professional interpreters, who translate spoken language as they hear it, have a very difficult job.",
  "In fact, they can only work a few hours a day because it requires so much concentration.",
  "If you listen to English and try to translate into your language at the same time, you're trying to be a professional interpreter, except you haven’t had the years of training that they’ve had.",
  "Also, you’re not getting paid like they are.",
  "Doesn’t sound like a good deal, right?.",
  "Again, when you’re listening to spoken English, just listen.",
  "Don’t do anything else.",
  "Don’t try to translate things.",
  "Don’t worry about words you don’t know.",
  "Don’t think about things you didn’t hear.",
  "Just listen.",
  "Want to know a simple secret about understanding spoken English?.",
  "You don’t have to understand what someone said to understand what they mean.",
  "Wait, what?.",
  "It’s true.",
  "Very often, I see English learners focusing too much on the things they don’t understand.",
  "I hear things like, “There was a word I didn’t know, so I couldn’t understand.” Here’s the thing: understanding doesn’t just depend on listening.",
  "Very often, there are other things you can use.",
  "For example, if you’re face to face with someone, you can use their body language, tone of voice and facial expressions to help you understand what they mean.",
  "Also, think about the situation you’re in.",
  "What is the other person likely to say?.",
  "What words are they likely to use?.",
  "For example, imagine you’re at the airport.",
  "You’re checking in for your flight.",
  "What questions might you expect to hear?.",
  "You’d probably hear questions like: Did you pack these bags yourself?.",
  "Have you already checked in online?.",
  "Would you like an aisle seat or a window seat?.",
  "Imagine you hear the last question, but you don’t know what aisle means.",
  "Even if you’ve never heard the word before, it shouldn’t stop you from understanding the question.",
  "You know that there are two choices, aisle seat or window seat.",
  "You know what window seat means.",
  "You know that aisle seat must mean something different from window seat.",
  "So, you can work it out.",
  "Similarly, imagine you hear this: Have you mbrmmnbsmgrm chicken online?.",
  "Chicken?.",
  "Did he say ‘chicken’? That doesn’t make sense… Right, it doesn’t make sense.",
  "So, probably the person behind the check-in desk didn’t say ‘chicken’, he probably said ‘check-in’, because that’s what you’re doing: you’re checking in for your flight.",
  "So, when you’re listening to spoken English, use everything you can to help you understand.",
  "Don’t think: “I didn’t understand one word, so I can’t understand anything.” It’s just not true!.",
  "At the beginning of this lesson, we looked at different situations where it might be easier or more difficult for you to understand spoken English.",
  "Generally, if you’re familiar with something, it’ll be easier to understand.",
  "For example, if you learn English from a teacher, and your teacher is male and British, you’ll probably find male British voices easier to understand.",
  "On the other hand, you might find female voices slightly more difficult.",
  "You might find other accents, like American voices or Australian voices, harder to understand.",
  "So, what’s the solution?.",
  "Very simple: listen to as many different voices as possible!.",
  "Don’t limit yourself.",
  "If you only listen to one kind of English, you’ll be good at understanding one kind of English.",
  "So, listen to different kinds of English.",
  "Listen to English people from the north, south, east and west of the country.",
  "Listen to Scottish speakers, Welsh speakers, and Irish speakers; listen to men, women and children; listen to Americans, Australians, Canadians and South Africans.",
  "Listen to Indian, Chinese, Russian or Brazilian English speakers.",
  "What's that?.",
  "You only want to listen to native English?.",
  "Fine, but remember that more English is spoken between non-native speakers in the world today, so it could be a very good use of your time to listen to non-native English as well.",
  "It’s not just about listening to different voices.",
  "You should listen to as many different formats and sources as possible.",
  "So, listen to songs, TV shows, films, audiobooks, textbook exercises, and anything else you can find.",
  "All of the advice in this lesson will help you improve your English listening, but you also need a practical plan to work on your English listening.",
  "Let’s make a plan together.",
  "Ready?.",
  "It’s very simple: you just need to follow two rules: Rule number 1.",
  "Do something every day.",
  "Rule number 2.",
  "Do something different every day.",
  "Easy, right?.",
  "“But, but, I don’t have time!” You don’t need much time.",
  "If you have ten minutes a day, spend ten minutes a day.",
  "Of course, more is better, but be realistic.",
  "Don’t say you’re going to spend an hour a day on English listening practice unless you’re sure you will do it!.",
  "A good target is 15-20 minutes a day.",
  "This is not too much, so it should be easy to stick to.",
  "It’s also enough to get better and improve.",
  "What about the second rule?.",
  "You need to do something different every day so that you listen to different sources and different voices.",
  "If you do the same thing every day, you won’t get enough variety.",
  "Here’s what your listening plan for one week could look like: Monday: listen to 1-2 songs, 2-3 times each.",
  "Tuesday: listen to a podcast with American voices.",
  "Wednesday: watch 15 minutes of a TV show from the UK.",
  "Thursday: do a listening exercise from a textbook.",
  "Friday: watch 15 minutes of a news show Saturday: watch 15 minutes of an old movie Sunday: call a friend and spend 15 minutes speaking in English!.",
  "This is just an example.",
  "Your plan might be different.",
  "That’s fine!.",
  "Here are some questions you probably have: “Where do I get materials?” Easy, get on Google or the search engine of your choice.",
  "There’s lots of stuff out there which is free if you have an Internet connection.",
  "Yes, you have to work a little to find materials that will suit you.",
  "That’s necessary, because you should choose your own listening materials.",
  "“How do I choose something which is the right level?” There’s a good rule here: the first time you listen to something, you should be able to understand more than 50% and less than 90%. If you can’t understand half of what you hear the first time you listen, then it’s too difficult.",
  "If you can understand more than 90% the first time you listen, then it’s too easy.",
  "So, try to choose materials which are in this range.",
  "“How do I stick to my plan and make sure I don’t give up?” Make your plan at the start of the week.",
  "Write it down.",
  "Stick it somewhere in your home, for example on the wall, or on your fridge.",
  "Think about what time of day you should do your English practice.",
  "Are you better in the mornings or in the evenings?.",
  "Try to do your listening practice when your brain is at its best!.",
  "Then, when you do your listening practice each day, cross it off your plan.",
  "That way, you’ll see what you’re doing every day.",
  "You won’t want to miss a day!.",
  "If you have good ideas for things to listen to in English, please share your suggestions with other English learners in the video comments.",
  "Did you enjoy this lesson?.",

  "How to Improve English Grammar - Tips to Learn English Grammar Faster.",
  "Hi, I’m Olivier.",
  "Welcome to Oxford Online English!.",
  "In this lesson, you can learn how to improve your English grammar.",
  "To some people, ‘grammar’ is kind of a dirty word.",
  "It probably makes you think of boring textbooks, boring exercises, and boring lessons.",
  "Maybe you think, “Why do I need grammar?.",
  "I just want to communicate.” But, here’s the thing: grammar isn’t just something in a book.",
  "Grammar is how you connect words into phrases, and phrases into sentences.",
  "Every time you connect two words, you’re using grammar.",
  "Even now, you’re using grammar to understand what we’re saying.",
  "We think there’s a better way to learn English grammar than just doing endless exercises.",
  "In this lesson, you’ll see a step-by-step, practical plan to improve your English grammar in any area.",
  "To work on grammar, it’s a good idea to have a book for reference.",
  "One of the most popular is English Grammar in Use by Raymond Murphy.",
  "You can find a link under the video.",
  "So, let’s start: you want to improve your English grammar.",
  "What should you do first?.",
  "‘English grammar’ is not just one topic.",
  "It’s tens of major topics, and each of those contains tens of smaller topics.",
  "So, you need to know where to begin.",
  "You need to set goals and establish priorities for your studies.",
  "How can you do that?.",
  "Let’s start with five things.",
  "Make a list of five errors or grammar problems you have.",
  "Maybe, you already know some errors you make.",
  "Maybe your teacher corrects you or your classmates often, and you have an idea.",
  "A good way to do this is through writing.",
  "Write something for your teacher, and ask them to highlight and correct your grammar mistakes.",
  "See which mistakes you make most often.",
  "If you aren’t studying with a teacher, what can you do?.",
  "This can be more difficult.",
  "One suggestion: use a grammar book which has exercises and an answer key.",
  "Choose five topics which you think you will find difficult.",
  "Do the exercises and check your answers.",
  "If you made a lot of mistakes, then you know you need to do more work on these topics.",
  "Here’s another suggestion: find a reading text, for example a news article online.",
  "Make sure the text is not too difficult for you.",
  "Read the text two to three times.",
  "Next, try to rewrite the text without looking at it.",
  "Don’t worry about getting it perfect; just do your best.",
  "Afterwards, compare your text with the original.",
  "Where did you make mistakes?.",
  "Did you make mistakes with verb forms?.",
  "With adverbs?.",
  "Word order?.",
  "This should show you where some of your grammar mistakes are.",
  "Okay, hopefully now you have a list of five grammar errors or weaknesses.",
  "It could look like this: Using the present perfect Word order in questions Using commas correctly Mixing up adjectives and adverbs Prepositions after adjectives Be as specific as you can with your list.",
  "Writing something like ‘verbs’ or ‘prepositions’ isn’t really helpful.",
  "Now, you have your list.",
  "What’s next?.",
  "If you have a problem with a grammar topic, there can be two basic reasons: form or function.",
  "The first possibility is that you don’t know how to form a structure correctly.",
  "For example, think about the present perfect verb tense: I have done… To form the present perfect, you need to know several things, such as: Use ‘have’ or ‘has’ plus a past participle Make negatives with ‘haven’t’ or ‘hasn’t’ Make questions by moving ‘have’ or ‘has’ before the subject If you don’t know these rules well, you might make mistakes like these: She have been to Cambodia.",
  "I don’t have finished.",
  "How long they have lived here?.",
  "Can you correct these mistakes?.",
  "Often, problems with form are habits.",
  "You say and write the wrong sentence hundreds of times, and then it’s hard to change it.",
  "The only way to correct these habits is to repeat and review the correct form many, many times.",
  "The best way to do that?.",
  "Use a flashcard app like Quizlet.",
  "We’ll talk about this in more detail later.",
  "Or, maybe you don’t know the correct form.",
  "If so, use your grammar book to check.",
  "Problems with form are simpler to understand, but sometimes they take a long time to fix, especially if your mistakes have become deep habits.",
  "You heard before that there are two basic reasons you could have problems with a grammar topic.",
  "What’s the other?.",
  "The other possibility is that you don’t understand the function.",
  "What does that mean?.",
  "‘Function’ means how a grammar structure is used, and what meaning it has.",
  "For example, think again about the present perfect verb tense.",
  "To use the present perfect correctly, you need to know things like: Use the present perfect to talk about states which started in the past and are still true now.",
  "Don’t use the present perfect to talk about finished times in the past.",
  "Use the present perfect to talk about life experiences when you don’t specify a time.",
  "Of course, there are more!.",
  "These are just examples.",
  "If you don’t understand these rules, you might make mistakes like these: I am living here since four years.",
  "We’ve had lunch three hours ago.",
  "Have you ever been to Japan last year?.",
  "Can you correct these mistakes?.",
  "Often, problems with function are problems with translation.",
  "Maybe your language doesn’t have this grammar structure, or maybe your language expresses expresses these ideas in a different way.",
  "If you have problems with the function of a grammar structure, what can you do?.",
  "First, check the rules in your grammar book and try to find example sentences.",
  "Think about how you would express the same ideas in your language.",
  "Secondly, think about how this grammar works in your language.",
  "Do you have the same structure?.",
  "Do you use it in the same way?.",
  "The most difficult grammar topics will often be things which don’t exist in your language.",
  "For example, many languages don’t have an exact equivalent to the present perfect in English, which is why so many English learners find this verb tense particularly difficult.",
  "However, thinking about the differences between your language and English can help to make things clearer.",
  "Okay, so now you’ve found your mistakes and thought about where they come from.",
  "What next?.",
  "You’re going to see one of the most powerful learning tools you can use.",
  "Even better, it’s simple!.",
  "Anyone can use it.",
  "It’s called templating.",
  "Templating means you take part of a sentence, and finish it in different ways.",
  "Let’s stick with the example of the present perfect.",
  "Here’s an unfinished sentence: I have never… Your job is to finish the sentence in five different ways.",
  "Make them as different as possible.",
  "Here’s one example: I have never eaten snake.",
  "Can you make one or two more?.",
  "Think about it now.",
  "You could make sentences like: I have never been to New Zealand.",
  "I have never seen ‘Titanic’. Try to make sentences which are true for you.",
  "This way, they’ll be more meaningful and easier to remember.",
  "Remember: you need five sentences for each template.",
  "That means you need to think of at least two more!.",
  "Think of two more things you’ve never done, and write them down.",
  "Let’s look at some more templates you could use to practice the present perfect: I have … this week.",
  "I haven’t … yet today.",
  "… have/has been living … for … I’ve been … recently.",
  "My … has … since … Can you see how you could complete these templates?.",
  "Think about it.",
  "Pause the video if you want more time.",
  "Let’s see some possibilities: I’ve watched this video three times this week.",
  "I haven’t had coffee yet today.",
  "My sister has been living in Milan for three years.",
  "I’ve been reading a lot of Chekhov recently.",
  "My wife has been a doctor since 2005.",
  "Of course, these are just suggestions!.",
  "You should write sentences which are true for you.",
  "Also, remember that you should try to write five sentences for each template.",
  "If you can’t think of five, write as many as you can.",
  "You can use this to practice any grammar topic.",
  "For example, here are three templates you could use to practice using must, have to and should: At work, we mustn’t … Tomorrow, I have to … If you want to learn English quickly, you should … Here are three templates you could use to practice talking about the future: Tonight, I’m … For my next vacation, we’re going to … Next year, I hope I’ll … You see, you can use this to practice anything.",
  "Why should you use this method?.",
  "What makes it so powerful?.",
  "It’s powerful because you’re learning grammar through real-life examples.",
  "Also, you’re learning grammar in full sentences.",
  "Finally, this lets you practice your vocabulary, too!.",
  "You have one more thing to do here.",
  "You need to make sure your templated sentences are correct.",
  "You’re going to use these templates to practice and learn.",
  "If you have any mistakes in your sentences, you’ll just create bad habits which will be difficult to change in the future.",
  "So, ask your teacher, ask a friend, or ask on an online forum.",
  "Make sure your sentences are correct.",
  "Now, you’re ready for step four.",
  "Flashcard apps like Quizlet or Anki are a great way to review and remember grammar when you’re learning English.",
  "Both of these apps are mostly free to use, although the Anki app for IoS costs money.",
  "Our staff and our students have had good results with both these apps.",
  "There are others available, and you should probably try different ones and see which one you like best!.",
  "You can find links underneath the video.",
  "So, why do you need an app like this?.",
  "Using a flashcard app will help you to remember more of what you study and practice.",
  "How can you do this?.",
  "First, you can make questions using your template sentences.",
  "Put one or two gaps in a sentence and make a question, like this: Do you remember the answer?.",
  "You can also make a question with a mistake which you make frequently.",
  "The answer is the corrected sentence.",
  "For example: Correct the mistake: I just have had a shower.",
  "Can you correct the mistake?.",
  "I’ve just had a shower.",
  "The word order was wrong.",
  "Put the correct sentence as your answer.",
  "So, there are two kinds of cards you can make: gapped sentences and error correction.",
  "You can make gapped sentence cards easier or harder by leaving out different numbers of words.",
  "For example: My sister has ________ ________ in Milan for three years.",
  "Or: My sister ________ ________ ________ ________ ________ ________ three years.",
  "You might be thinking: this sounds like a lot of work!.",
  "Do I really have to make my own cards?.",
  "Do I have to do this for every grammar topic I study?.",
  "No, you don’t have to, but you should.",
  "Here’s why: First, you should make your own cards so that you’re using your own examples.",
  "Your own examples should mean something to you.",
  "They’re real; they’re about you and your life.",
  "This makes them easier to remember.",
  "Secondly, you should spend the time to make your own cards because it will save you time later.",
  "If you review efficiently, you can remember seventy to eighty percent of what you learn.",
  "If you don’t, you’ll forget most of what you study, and then you’ll have to do it again in the future.",
  "So, spending time now will save you a lot more time in the future.",
  "Not only that: isn’t it frustrating when you can’t remember something you’ve studied tens of times?.",
  "It’s demotivating, and that’s a problem.",
  "You need to be motivated to learn English!.",
  "Using flashcards and templating will help you to remember more of what you study.",
  "This will give you motivation, because you’ll feel that you’re making more progress.",
  "Finally, make sure you review your cards every day, or as often as possible.",
  "Review your cards when you have a spare moment during the day.",
  "For example, do them before you get up in the morning, or on the subway to work, or during a break.",
  "Now, you have a four-step process to improve your English grammar: Step one: identify and write down your weaknesses.",
  "Start with five topics maximum.",
  "The topics you write down should be as specific as possible.",
  "Step two: identify the mistakes you make and the problems you have.",
  "Do you have problems with the form, or the function, or both?.",
  "Use a grammar book to check, or ask a teacher.",
  "Step three: make templates, and write five full sentences for each template.",
  "The sentences should be real: write true sentences about you and your life.",
  "Check your sentences carefully and make sure they’re correct.",
  "Step four: take your sentences and make them into flashcards.",
  "You can make gapped sentences or error correction questions.",
  "Review your cards regularly.",
  "And that’s all!.",
  "Use these tools, and you can learn anything you want to efficiently.",
  "Tell us: what’s the first grammar topic you’re going to review?.",
  "Let us know in the comments, and we can see if you have similar ideas or not!.",

  "How to Learn English Vocabulary (and remember it!). Hi, I’m Kasia.",
  "Welcome to Oxford Online English!.",
  "I can’t remember English vocabulary!.",
  "How do I learn new words?.",
  "I learn lots of new words in English, but I can’t use them!.",
  "I want to have a bigger vocabulary in English.",
  "In this lesson, you can learn how to learn, remember and use new vocabulary in English.",
  "You can see the common mistakes which many English learners make when learning vocabulary, and you’ll see several simple, practical ideas that you can use to build your English vocabulary and remember what you learn.",
  "Let’s start with a general point that’s very important.",
  "Here are some things we often hear from English learners: “I couldn’t read it.",
  "There were too many new words and I didn’t have time to look them all up in the dictionary.” “I wrote down all of these new words and I tried to learn them, but I can’t remember any of them now!” Sound familiar?.",
  "Here’s a fact about your brain: your brain is very good at throwing away things it doesn’t need.",
  "Vocabulary learning starts when you choose which words and phrases to learn or not learn.",
  "This is where many English learners go wrong, by making one of these mistakes: Trying to learn too many words.",
  "Trying to learn words you don’t need.",
  "Trying to learn big lists of words.",
  "Trying to learn words you don’t know how to use.",
  "To avoid these mistakes, you need to choose the vocabulary you study carefully.",
  "Most importantly, if you want to remember new words and new English vocabulary, you need to learn things which are useful or meaningful to you.",
  "If you read a text, and you try to look up every word you don’t know, of course you’ll forget most of them.",
  "Most of the words you look up probably won’t be useful to you, and so your brain won’t hold onto them.",
  "If you write down a list of 100 new words and try to learn them, the words won’t mean much to you.",
  "They’re just a list on a piece of paper—totally abstract, and also boring!.",
  "Our brains don’t like boring.",
  "Boring gets forgotten, fast.",
  "So, what’s the solution?.",
  "Only learn a word or phrase if it’s really useful or meaningful to you in some way.",
  "For example: Your teacher keeps using a word that you don’t know.",
  "You hear it several times, but you can’t work out what it means.",
  "Then, you hear other people use the same word.",
  "You’re curious: what is this word you keep hearing?.",
  "You’re reading a really interesting article.",
  "You don’t know every word, but you can understand the general ideas.",
  "In one paragraph, there’s a word which you don’t know, and which makes it difficult for you to understand the idea of the paragraph.",
  "You think the paragraph is important to the article, and you’re interested to know what it means.",
  "You’re on holiday in a country where English is widely spoken.",
  "There’s one kind of food you really want to order, but you don’t know the word in English.",
  "These are situations where a new word will have meaning to you.",
  "If you look up words in situations like these, you’re more likely to remember them.",
  "Firstly, you’ll remember them because these are words you need to use.",
  "Secondly, you’ll remember them because these are all situations which involve your feelings in some way.",
  "In the first example, you’re curious about something.",
  "In the second, you’re interested in the article you’re reading.",
  "In the third situation, you’re (hopefully) having fun on holiday.",
  "So, this is the first and most important point.",
  "Learn words and phrases which are useful and meaningful for you.",
  "This gives you the best chance to remember and use what you learn.",
  "Now, another important point: when you say, “I learned a new word,” you could mean one of two things.",
  "You could mean that you learned to understand a new word, or you could mean that you learned to use a new word.",
  "Those two things are different.",
  "Let’s talk about that!.",
  "You might have heard the terms ‘passive vocabulary’ and ‘active vocabulary’. Your passive vocabulary means words you can understand, but you don’t use.",
  "Your active vocabulary means words you can use in your speech or writing.",
  "It’s normal that your passive vocabulary is larger than your active vocabulary in any language, including your native language.",
  "Many English learners say, “I can understand words but I can’t use them.” To some extent, this is normal.",
  "However, what can you do if you want to develop your active vocabulary in English?.",
  "There are two important points here.",
  "First, you need to use different techniques to build passive or active vocabulary.",
  "Many English learners have problems building their active vocabulary because the techniques they use to learn vocabulary only increase their passive vocabulary.",
  "Secondly, building active vocabulary takes a lot more time and work.",
  "If you want to build your active vocabulary, you need to spend a lot more time studying and practising each word or phrase you want to learn.",
  "Let’s look at the first point.",
  "Here are some good techniques for building passive vocabulary: Looking up a translation of a word in your language.",
  "Guessing the meaning of a word from the context.",
  "Looking up a definition of a word in a monolingual dictionary.",
  "Finding example sentences.",
  "Reading and listening.",
  "So, if your vocabulary learning consists of translating everything into your language, don’t be surprised if you can’t use what you learn.",
  "This is an okay technique for building your passive vocabulary, but it won’t help you to use the words and phrases you study.",
  "What about building active vocabulary?.",
  "Here are some good techniques for building your active vocabulary: Writing stories or other things that are personal to you.",
  "Using a new word several times in several different conversations.",
  "Making example sentences which are personal to you.",
  "You can see that these things are not necessarily complicated, but they do require more effort.",
  "It’s much harder to write an example sentence which is personal to you than it is to read someone else’s example sentence.",
  "It’s much harder to write a story which means something to you than it is to read something which someone else wrote.",
  "But, if you want to build your active vocabulary, this is how!.",
  "Most English learners are more interested in developing their active vocabulary, so in the rest of this lesson, we’ll focus on specific techniques you can use to build your active vocabulary in English.",
  "Let’s start with a very important and powerful idea.",
  "Here’s a question: what is vocabulary?.",
  "Did you say ‘words’? Many people think that ‘vocabulary equals words’. Of course, words are part of vocabulary, but they’re only a part.",
  "Vocabulary also includes collocations, phrases, and even full sentences.",
  "Even when you’re learning words, you rarely need single words when you’re speaking.",
  "You need to combine the words into phrases and sentences if you want to use them.",
  "So, it makes sense to learn vocabulary in the same way: learn phrases, combinations and sentences, because this is what you need when you’re speaking and writing.",
  "Let’s do an example.",
  "Imagine that you see the word challenge and you want to know what it means.",
  "So, you look it up and find the meaning.",
  "Next, your goal is to write five sentences using the word challenge.",
  "Each sentence should be different, and each sentence should mean something to you.",
  "Try to write things which relate to your life, your feelings and your thoughts.",
  "You can (and should) also try to use different forms of the word, like the adjective challenging.",
  "You should also research other examples before you write yours.",
  "Look for common collocations—word combinations—with the word you want to learn.",
  "For example, what adjectives are commonly used with the word challenge?.",
  "Think about it.",
  "What phrases or sentences could you write with this word?.",
  "We’ll give you an example, but remember that you should make your own examples, because they should be personal to you.",
  "Here are five possible sentences: I’m bored at work.",
  "I need a new challenge.",
  "Teaching teenagers is fun, but it can be very challenging.",
  "Running a full marathon was one of the biggest challenges I’ve ever faced.",
  "I set myself a challenge last year: to learn German to a native-equivalent level.",
  "My sister is a really determined person; she’s not someone who’ll run away from a challenge.",
  "We’ll say it again, because it’s the most important point here: whatever you write should be personal to you.",
  "Don’t write a sentence about your sister if you don’t have a sister.",
  "Don’t say something about your sister which isn’t true.",
  "Make it true, and make it personal.",
  "If it’s personal to you, you’ll remember it.",
  "If it isn’t, you’ll forget it.",
  "Simple, right?.",
  "At this point, there’s one more important thing you should do.",
  "Ask a teacher, a native speaker or a friend who’s very good at English to check your sentences.",
  "You want to make sure you’re learning your new vocabulary correctly, and you need feedback to do that.",
  "You can also see that writing sentences like this lets you learn several useful phrases at one time.",
  "For example, here you have the collocations a new challenge, to face a challenge, a big challenge, to set (yourself) a challenge, and run away from a challenge.",
  "So, if you follow this strategy, you won’t just learn one word, like challenge.",
  "You’ll learn several words and phrases together, in a natural way.",
  "Remember that this strategy is personal on both sides: you’re starting with words that are meaningful to you personally, and then you’re learning those words by writing examples which are also meaningful to you personally.",
  "Yes, this needs work, and it might be very different from what you do now.",
  "However, if you want an effective way to learn and remember vocabulary, this is it.",
  "If you do things this way, nothing is abstract and nothing is boring.",
  "Your brain will remember what you learn because it’s relevant to you, your life and your feelings.",
  "However, if you’re trying to learn a lot of vocabulary, it’s also important to review what you’ve learned regularly.",
  "Regular review helps to keep vocabulary fresh in your mind, which will help you to remember the words and phrases you need when you’re speaking or writing in English.",
  "Let’s look at the most effective ways to review your vocabulary.",
  "If you have a lot of English vocabulary to review and remember, it’s a big, complex job.",
  "But, we have good news!.",
  "There are several free tools and apps which can make this easy.",
  "You need a digital flashcard app.",
  "These apps are designed to help you memorise and review large amounts of information.",
  "Two of the most popular are Anki and Quizlet.",
  "You can find links below the video.",
  "We aren’t recommending any particular product or company, but many students have used both of these with good results.",
  "We hear that Quizlet is a little easier to use, while Anki is more powerful and has more options, but is also more complex.",
  "Try both, or find another program, and see what works for you.",
  "All of these programs work in the same way: they allow you to set questions for yourself.",
  "You create a card with a question and an answer.",
  "You can write whatever you want for the question and the answer.",
  "After you see a question and the answer, you decide if the question was easy or difficult for you.",
  "If the question is easy, the app will ask you again after a longer period.",
  "If the question is difficult, the app will ask you the same question again after a shorter period, maybe even the same day.",
  "This is very effective, because it allows you to focus more on the things you don’t know, and it doesn’t waste your time reviewing things you already know well.",
  "You can often download packs of questions that other people have made, but you should make your own questions, using your own, personalised example sentences.",
  "Let’s see how.",
  "Look at the five sentences we wrote before to learn the word challenge: Let’s make five questions from these five sentences.",
  "Question: I’m bored at work.",
  "I need ________.",
  "Answer: I’m bored at work.",
  "I need a new challenge.",
  "Question: Teaching teenagers is fun, but _________ Answer: Teaching teenagers is fun, but it can be very challenging.",
  "Question: I ________ last year: to learn German to a native-equivalent level.",
  "Answer: I set myself a challenge last year: to learn German to a native-equivalent level.",
  "Question: Running a full marathon was _________ Answer: Running a full marathon was one of the biggest challenges I’ve ever faced.",
  "Question: My sister is a really determined person; ________.",
  "Answer: My sister is a really determined person; she’s not someone who’ll run away from a challenge.",
  "Can you see what’s going on here?.",
  "The questions are getting progressively more difficult.",
  "For the first question, you only have to remember three words: a new challenge.",
  "For the fifth question, you need to remember a whole clause.",
  "After you’ve made your questions, what next?.",
  "Review your vocabulary cards or questions every day.",
  "We recommend you install Anki, Quizlet or whatever you use on your phone.",
  "This way, you can review vocabulary when you have nothing else to do, for example on the subway or during your lunch break.",
  "Try to use your app and review vocabulary every day, but don’t overload yourself.",
  "Limit the number of new questions or cards you see each day.",
  "Five new questions per day is a good target.",
  "Again, this takes quite a lot of work.",
  "You might think, “Do I really have to do all this just to remember one word?” Let me ask you some questions in return: do you want to really build your English vocabulary?.",
  "Do you want to remember new English words that you study?.",
  "Do you want to learn to use new English vocabulary?.",
  "If you answered ‘yes’, ‘yes’, and ‘yes’, then this is how.",
  "It takes time and effort, but it also works.",
  "Let’s review the steps you need to take: One: choose words which are useful and meaningful to you personally; don’t learn big lists of words, and don’t learn words which you won’t use.",
  "Two: decide if you want to just understand a word, or if you want to use it.",
  "Use different vocabulary-learning techniques depending on what you want.",
  "Three: if you want to add words to your active vocabulary, then write 3-5 example sentences, using the new word.",
  "The sentences should be relevant to you, your life, your thoughts and your feelings.",
  "Four: get feedback on your example sentences, from a teacher or friend, to make sure you’re using your new vocabulary correctly.",
  "Five: add your example sentences to a digital flashcard app like Quizlet or Anki.",
  "Make questions of different difficulty, so that some questions are easier and some are harder.",
  "Six: use your digital flashcard app daily, or as often as you can!.",
  "Follow these steps and your English vocabulary will increase, you’ll remember new words in English, and you’ll be able to use the new English words you learn.",

  "How to Feel Less Shy Speaking English - Improve English Speaking Confidence Now!. Hello.",
  "I'm Oli.",
  "Welcome to Oxford Online English.",
  "In this lesson, you can learn about dealing with shyness or nervousness when you speak English.",
  "Do you sometimes feel shy when you speak English?.",
  "Is it worse when you speak to native speakers?.",
  "Do these feelings of shyness or nervousness stop you from practicing and using your English?.",
  "Yes?.",
  "Yes?.",
  "And yes?.",
  "This video could hopefully help you.",
  "Shyness and nervousness are natural, but they also make it more difficult to speak.",
  "If you feel shy, you might not be able to think of things to say, or you might not be able to use grammar and vocabulary correctly.",
  "Some English learners get stuck in a pattern where they feel shy, and so they avoid using English or speaking English.",
  "Now I can't promise to solve all of your problems with shyness and nervousness.",
  "But in this video, I'll share some advice on how to deal with these feelings, which I hope will be helpful.",
  "Point one, remember that speaking is just speaking.",
  "What do I mean?.",
  "Well, when we first hear foreign languages or meet foreigners, they often sound very strange or interesting or exotic to us.",
  "Oh, he's speaking French.",
  "Wow!.",
  "He must be saying something romantic, or he must be talking about literature or philosophy.",
  "I wish I could understand him.",
  "Oh, wow!.",
  "She's writing in Chinese.",
  "Those characters, they're so beautiful.",
  "She must be writing a poem.",
  "I wish I could understand what she's writing.",
  "Yeah, you know what?.",
  "Maybe the French guy is talking about philosophy.",
  "Maybe he's just talking about how he got stuck in a traffic jam.",
  "Maybe the Chinese girl is writing a poem about misty mountains, or maybe it's just a shopping list.",
  "If you think that foreign languages and foreign people are something strange or exotic, of course, you'll feel more nervous when you're speaking.",
  "I think many English learners have this idea.",
  "They think, \"Oh, I'm not talking to a person.",
  "I'm talking to a native speaker.\" But actually, speaking English isn't something special.",
  "It's just speaking, like you do all day, every day.",
  "All over the world, most of what people talk about is quite simple, and it's quite similar all over the world.",
  "Native English speakers aren't different animals.",
  "They're just normal people.",
  "They talk about their work.",
  "They complain about their bosses.",
  "They talk about movies they've seen.",
  "They decide what they're going to have for lunch and so on, just like anybody else.",
  "So don't think that native speakers are some kind of magical animal.",
  "They're not.",
  "If you want to talk to them, talk to them.",
  "If you don't, don't.",
  "It's not such a big deal either way.",
  "What?.",
  "Not a big deal?.",
  "Really?.",
  "Yeah, really.",
  "You need to ask yourself, part two, \"What's the worst that could happen?\" So you feel really nervous about speaking English.",
  "One day, you find the courage, you go and talk to a teacher at your school, maybe a British person or an American person.",
  "It goes horribly badly.",
  "You feel really uncomfortable.",
  "You can't think of anything to say.",
  "So you walk away, and you think thoughts like, \"I've embarrassed myself.",
  "I feel like an idiot.",
  "Why is my English so bad?\" Here's a question though.",
  "What have you actually lost?.",
  "Nothing.",
  "It's not a big deal.",
  "It's just a conversation.",
  "The big deal is only in your head.",
  "You think these thoughts.",
  "Nobody else.",
  "10 years in the future, are you still going to be thinking and worrying about that time when, \"Oh, I tried to start a conversation, and it didn't go very well.\"? No, of course not.",
  "Why not?.",
  "Because it's not that important.",
  "Maybe it feels like a big deal.",
  "It feels important at that moment, but it's not really important.",
  "You haven't lost anything.",
  "You may feel embarrassed, or you may feel stupid, but you're doing that to yourself.",
  "There's no reason why.",
  "No one else is telling you you're stupid.",
  "You aren't risking anything, just by starting a conversation.",
  "I guarantee the person you talk to is not thinking these thoughts.",
  "So what can you do about these feelings?.",
  "How can you control them?.",
  "Well, let's look at point three: wear a mask.",
  "These feelings of nervousness or shyness are all inside.",
  "Here's the best piece of advice I can give you.",
  "Just because you feel nervous, you don't have to act nervous.",
  "Let me tell you a story.",
  "Before I started teaching, I was terrified of public speaking.",
  "Even speaking in front of very small groups made me feel very nervous and very, very stressed.",
  "The first lesson I ever taught was to a group of maybe eight Russian teenagers, just a small class.",
  "It was the most scared I've ever been in my life.",
  "That's not an exaggeration.",
  "I have quite seriously never felt so much fear.",
  "I was shaking.",
  "I was sweating.",
  "I couldn't remember anything about my lesson.",
  "I tried to teach something about modal verbs.",
  "I don't think anybody learned anything.",
  "Afterwards, I thought, \"How am I going to do this?\" My trainer gave me the same advice I'm giving you.",
  "Act confident, even if you don't feel confident.",
  "So I did.",
  "The first few months, I still felt really nervous, but I tried to hide it.",
  "After maybe a year, I didn't feel so nervous.",
  "After a few years, I could stand in front of 100 people and expect their attention, even if I still felt a little bit nervous inside.",
  "If it worked for me, it can work for you.",
  "Sure, it takes time, and it's not easy, but it's possible.",
  "So act confident.",
  "Hold your head up.",
  "Chin up.",
  "Make eye contact, even if it makes you uncomfortable.",
  "Control the speed and the rhythm of your voice.",
  "Doing these things is not so difficult, and it will make you feel good because you're taking control of your feelings, instead of letting your feelings control you.",
  "OK, you think, \"Easy for you, Oli.",
  "You're talking about speaking your own language.",
  "We're talking about speaking a foreign language.\" OK, let's talk about that.",
  "Point four: worrying about your language makes your language worse.",
  "Here's a question: when you hear a foreigner speak your language, how do you decide if this person is speaking well or badly?.",
  "In most cases, people notice your fluency and your pronunciation.",
  "In speech, people don't pay much attention to grammar and vocabulary if your speech is easy to understand.",
  "What does this mean?.",
  "It means that if you are embarrassed of your grammar or your vocabulary when you're speaking English, you really shouldn't be.",
  "First of all, worrying doesn't solve anything anyway.",
  "If your grammar is bad, worrying about your grammar will not make it better.",
  "The only result is that you will feel bad.",
  "That's it.",
  "Secondly, other people will really not notice your grammar or vocabulary very much.",
  "Most people don't care about these things, most people who aren't English teachers.",
  "Even English teachers care about these things at work, and then they stop caring after work.",
  "Trust me.",
  "If I've been teaching all day, and you come and talk to me, I do not want to think about your grammar or your vocabulary problems.",
  "That's the last thing I want to do at the end of the day.",
  "Most teachers I know feel the same way.",
