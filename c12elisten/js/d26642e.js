  "once upon a time this story happened in a cave in the middle of far away sahara desert.",
  "there was a magic lamp that looked nothing different from others.",
  "however whoever owned it could command the genie living inside the lamp thus all their wishes could come true.",
  "it's so boring it's been over 300 years since i served the last owner.",
  "since then no one has found this lamp to help me go out to play.",
  "suddenly a breeze blue seemed very happy.",
  "the genie then disappeared from the lamp.",
  "the man quickly appeared in the middle of the cave in front of him was a young man named aladdin.",
  "hello my master i am a genie who has lived in this lamp for more than 300 years.",
  "as you have just let me free i will do whatever you want.",
  "uh a genie really what you've said is true isn't it.",
  "of course my master i will meet all your demands how could you come here.",
  "it's a very long story.",
  "aladdin began to recall his past.",
  "he was such a poor boy whose father passed away prematurely.",
  "living in poverty he had no choice but to steal money to earn his living.",
  "one day a magician came and asked him to do one thing with a good deal.",
  "aladdin i have heard about you as a great thief in this kingdom.",
  "if you help me to do this work i will give you so much money that you can live in wealth for the rest of your life.",
  "being a kind man he didn't want to continue stealing.",
  "so he agreed with the magician's request.",
  "what does he want me to do.",
  "well just try one last time and i will give up.",
  "i don't want to be a thief like this forever.",
  "after that the magician took aladdin to a mysterious cave in the middle of the desert.",
  "he asked aladdin to sneak into the cave.",
  "aladdin enter that cave remember not to touch anything except the lamp in the middle of the cave.",
  "once you can take it quickly come here and give it to me.",
  "because aladdin had agreed with the magician.",
  "he snuck into the cave to find the lamp for him.",
  "but aladdin didn't know that he was in danger if anything in the cave was repositioned the cave entrance would collapse immediately.",
  "many had perished there but the magician didn't tell aladdin that secret.",
  "going inside aladdin was stunned by many gems and treasures there.",
  "and he saw an old lamp was placed in the middle of the cave.",
  "why does he only need a little lamp but not these jewels or did he not know about the large amount of treasure inside.",
  "after he obtained the lamb the whole cave started shaking.",
  "aladdin quickly returned to the entrance raised the lamp.",
  "and asked the magician to bring him up.",
  "sir i've got the lamp for you.",
  "it seems like the cave is about to collapse.",
  "please throw the rope down and pull me up then i'll give you the lamp.",
  "no one is allowed to know about this magic lamp secret.",
  "so i can't let him live it's time to annihilate him.",
  "great first give me the lamp and then i will drop the rope and pull you up.",
  "why does he want me to give him the lamp first.",
  "what's wrong with pulling me and the lamp up at the same time.",
  "or is he intending to do something.",
  "no you have to pull me up first then i will give you this land.",
  "you jerk give me the lambor you'll have to stay in that cave for the rest of your life.",
  "never do not try to fool me.",
  "no sooner had aladdin finish speaking his last words the cave door slammed down and locked him inside the dark cave.",
  "you jerk if you weren't an infamous thief.",
  "never a guy like you would have the privilege of coming down there to take the magic lamp.",
  "now you dare to provoke me you will have to be dying inside the cave.",
  "there will be many people can do this job for me.",
  "not giving up aladdin searched everywhere inside the cave to find a way to escape.",
  "however he couldn't find out any exit.",
  "except for the one locked down by the rocks.",
  "it was getting dark and aladdin was also really tired.",
  "not knowing what else to do.",
  "he lighted the lamp to illuminate.",
  "when he rubbed the lamp the genie suddenly appeared.",
  "that's what happened.",
  "now i just want to go home.",
  "my mother must be very worried.",
  "could you help me do that.",
  "that's really simple to me my master as you wish.",
  "the genie swung his hand magically.",
  "then a smoke swirled much to the surprise of aladdin.",
  "in an instant he could leave the cave and stand in front of his house.",
  "hooray i was home already so unbelievable.",
  "since then aladdin got anything he wished.",
  "he no longer had to steal anything as he used to.",
  "because of his wealth.",
  "he could also use much of his properties to help the poor people in his kingdom.",
  "aladdin met the genie every day.",
  "the genie cherished him so much because aladdin reminded him of his youth.",
  "when the genie always desired to discover everything in this world.",
  "master do you know when i was as young as you are now.",
  "i was also curious and wanted to discover new things all the time.",
  "and that was also the beginning of my mission to become a genie.",
  "really well i think as we are young we should go discover many interesting things out there.",
  "but i want to tell you this.",
  "what is it master.",
  "from now on just treat me like a family member by calling me aladdin.",
  "i'm not comfortable with being called master.",
  "thank you master oh no thank you aladdin  [Laughter].",
  "one day while aladdin was walking on the street he saw princess jasmine passing by.",
  "the princess is coming everyone kneel.",
  "close all stalls quickly.",
  "whoever dares to look at the princess will be executed.",
  "aladdin was very curious.",
  "he hid behind a stall to see the princess.",
  "right after looking at her beautiful face.",
  "he knew that he had a crush on the princess.",
  "as always aladdin confided to the genie that he really wanted to marry princess jasmine.",
  "but how could a commoner marry the noble princess.",
  "aladdin i can help you be qualified enough to marry the princess.",
  "but that doesn't mean you would win her heart.",
  "what should i do then.",
  "you should be beside the princess.",
  "know more about her and win her affection.",
  "don't just use properties.",
  "those things are just important once you win her heart.",
  "i have one thing which can help you win her heart more easily.",
  "in order to help aladdin.",
  "the genie gave him a magic carpet so that he could easily approach the princess.",
  "every day aladdin flew to the balcony of the princess's room by that carpet and talked to her.",
  "the princess was really surprised by aladdin's appearance on the first night.",
  "who are you how did you come here.",
  "princess i'm aladdin just a normal person who fortunately has a flying magic carpet.",
  "since i have admired you for so long i took a risk to come here.",
  "really what an amazing carpet.",
  "you make me so curious.",
  "gradually the princess turned to be so eager to meet aladdin in the evening.",
  "aladdin brought her a whole new world with his stories.",
  "with the romantic trips on the magic carpet to travel around the kingdom.",
  "which a princess in the forbidden palace had never experienced.",
  "then they gradually fell in love with each other.",
  "seeing them being happy like that the genie contentedly smiled like a father always did when he saw his son is happy.",
  "then aladdin brought countless gold and silver chests to ask proposed the princess.",
  "and was accepted by the king.",
  "their wedding was held solemnly inside aladdin's castle.",
  "which the genie had made for him however the magician appeared intrudingly on that day.",
  "aladdin you insolent you should have died in that cave turns out you have already known the secret of the lamp.",
  "all right the traitor i'll teach you a lesson.",
  "he disguised himself as a lamp seller.",
  "who exchanged old lamps for new ones.",
  "then he pushed the lamp cart to the front door of aladdin's palace and said.",
  "exchange an old lamp for a new one at a low price.",
  "hmm aladdin's lamp in the room is too old.",
  "i have to get him a new one.",
  "the innocent princess jasmine had been deceived.",

  "he immediately appeared.",
  "hello master i am a genie i will fulfill all your wishes.",
  "ha ha well you slave i want to own this castle.",
  "and it must be the middle of the desert so that no one can find out.",

  "aladdin what did you do to my daughter.",
  "if you don't bring her back in three days you'll be executed.",
  "it's certainly the magician who is the culprit.",
  "as he knew that i have the lamp he came back for revenge.",
  "i will find you a cruel magician.",
  "fortunately aladdin still kept the magic carpet.",
  "he used it to search for his castle around the kingdom.",
  "finally he found it located in the middle of the desert.",
  "since being kidnapped by the magician.",
  "princess jasmine had been so depressed that she didn't even say a single word.",

  "aladdin everything will be as you wish.",
  "in the blink of an eye the magician was trapped inside a desolate cave and unable to find a way out.",
  "when he woke up and realized what happened he shouted.",
