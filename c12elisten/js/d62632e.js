  "p06 REAL LIFE ENGLISH SERIES.",
  "Welcome to the real-life English series!.",
  "Today, you are going to learn real English used by native English speakers.",
  "Are you ready?.",
  "Well then.",
  "I'm Teacher Tiffani, let's jump right in.",
  "So what I want you to do is take a look at this image.",
  "There are three individuals but if we zoom in on one individual, the first word that pops into my mind is rolling.",
  "Rolling.",
  "Now, I want you to repeat after me for pronunciation practice.",
  "Rolling.",
  "Excellent!.",
  "Now while looking at it.",
  "Rolling.",
  "Great job!.",
  "Now rolling just means to laugh very hard.",
  "Just like I did just now, right?.",
  "In English, when someone is laughing a lot and very hard, we say, \"Woo!.",
  "That person is rolling.\" Make sense, right?.",
  "Now let me give you an example sentence so you can understand it even more.",
  "Here we go!.",
  "The kids were rolling when the little boy told them a funny joke.",
  "You know how it is right when someone tells you a good joke and you just get, you can't keep it in, right?.",
  "You start laughing very hard.",
  "In English, we say, \"Man, you were rolling.\" So again, the kids were rolling when the little boy told them a funny joke.",
  "Now I want you to be able to use this so here's the pattern you can follow.",
  "\"I was rolling when...\" Think of a situation or a time period when, where you were just completely, you lost it.",
  "You started laughing because something was so funny.",
  "Again in English we say, rolling and the pattern is \"I was rolling when...\". Here's the sentence using the pattern.",
  "I was rolling when my friend told me what happened during the meeting.",
  "So something funny happened during the meeting and this individual said, \"Man, I was rolling when my friend told me what happened during the meeting.",
  "Make sense, right?.",
  "All right!.",
  "Now let's take a look at another portion of the image.",
  "Again, these ladies are sitting together but if we go to another section we see this right here, the laptop and we see this individual and I think of this word, focus.",
  "After me, focus.",
  "Excellent!.",
  "Again, focus.",
  "Great job!.",
  "Now this word focus just means giving a lot of attention to one particular thing.",
  "Again, giving a lot of attention to one particular thing and here's a sentence.",
  "All of the students were focused on their exam questions.",
  "Think about it.",
  "When you were in school or maybe you're in school now.",
  "You would study a lot or you are studying a lot right now and when you had to take the exam or when you have to take your exam, you are going to put a lot of attention on the questions on the test, right?.",
  "You're going to focus.",
  "So again, all of the students were focused on their exam questions.",
  "Make sense, right?.",
  "Okay.",
  "Now let's do a quick quiz.",
  "I wanna see if you are ready.",
  "Oh!.",
  "Wait a minute before that, let me give you a pattern cause I want you to be able to use it like a native English speaker.",
  "So, here we go!.",
  "The pattern is right here.",
  "\"I focus the most when I...\" Very simple pattern.",
  "Again, \"I focus the most when I...\" Now for me personally, I actually focus the most when I listened to jazz music.",
  "My dad when I was growing up, he loved jazz music so I got in the habit of when I'm working or doing something where I need to focus listening to jazz music.",
  "So, I can use the pattern and I can say this right here.",
  "I focused the most when I play soft jazz music.",
  "You caught it, right?.",
  "It make sense, right?.",
  "So I want you to use the pattern as well.",
  "\"I focus the most when I...\" Now it's time for your first quiz.",
  "Here we go!.",
  "And I want you again to think about what we've learned so far.",
  "Here's the question.",
  "Here's the fill in the blank sentence.",
  "It is important to...when you play chess.",
  "You have five seconds.",
  "Go!.",
  "Time, what's the answer.",
  "Excellent!.",
  "Yes, it is important to focus when you play chess.",
  "Excellent!.",
  "Very good!.",
  "Now here's the next question.",
  "All right!.",
  "Let's restart our timer.",
  "The two kids were...when their friend tripped and fell.",
  "Five seconds starts now.",
  "Time, what's the answer?.",
  "Yes, you got it!.",
  "The two kids were rolling when their friend tripped and fell.",
  "Make sense?.",
  "Excellent!.",
  "Again, so we've learned again so far two things.",
  "We've learned focus and we also learned, you got it!.",
  "Rolling.",
  "So let's keep going.",
  "I want us to go back and look at the next part of the image if we zoom into another section of the image, we'll see something else.",
  "Right here!.",
  "Popped collar.",
  "Now this is something you probably never heard before and you probably have never seen this in an English book.",
  "Once again, I want you to look at it with me.",
  "Popped collar.",
  "Excellent!.",
  "Last time, popped collar.",
  "Very good!.",
  "Now I want you to very quickly look at the picture once again.",
  "Look at the jacket she's wearing.",
  "You see how the collar is kind of up.",
  "Well in English, we call that a popped collar.",
  "So the meaning again, popping or lifting the collar of a shirt so that it covers the neck.",
  "In English we say, you are popping your collar.",
  "I remember when I was in high school.",
  "A lot of the guys would pop the collar of their polo shirts because you know, they wanted to look cool.",
  "They would pop their collars.",
  "Again, real-life English.",
  "So here's the sentence.",
  "The high school seniors liked to pop their collars to show that they were cool.",
  "You got it, right?.",
  "Now, let me give you the sentence pattern so that you can start using this and start sounding more like a native English speaker.",
  "Here's the pattern.",
  "\"Whenever I wear my... I like to pop my collar.\" Again, think of a specific shirt or jacket.",
  "The pattern once again, \"Whenever I wear my... I like to pop my collar.\" So here's a sentence using the pattern.",
  "Whenever I wear my bright orange polo shirt I like to pop my collar.",
  "You got it, right?.",
  "All right.",
  "Good!.",
  "So again, we have popped collar.",
  "Now I want us to go back to the image and look at this part right here.",
  "You see a wonderful, beautiful leather journal and the word that pops up is studious.",
  "Again, real-life English.",
  "When I look at this image, the very first thing that pops into my head as a native English speaker is the word studious so I want you to repeat after me, studious.",
  "Excellent!.",
  "Now while looking at it, studious.",
  "Great job!.",
  "Now studious, a studious person is just someone that enjoys studying or spends a lot of time studying.",
  "I was a studious individual when I was in school.",
  "I loved learning and I still enjoy learning now.",
  "So again, a studious person is someone that enjoys studying or spends a lot of time studying.",
  "So here's a sentence.",
  "The woman was very quiet and studious.",
  "Again, the woman was very quiet and studious.",
  "You got it?.",
  "Now, let me give you the sentence pattern you can use to start sounding like a native English speaker.",
  "\"...was the most studious person I knew when I was in high school.\" They go person, an individual.",
  "Again, \"...was the most studious person I knew when I was in high school.\" So, I can say right here.",
  "My best friend was the most studious person I knew when I was in high school.",
  "You got it, right?.",
  "Very simple pattern.",
  "Think of someone you knew when you were in high school that was extremely studious.",
  "All right!.",
  "Now let's go back to the image because there's one other portion I want us to check out.",
  "If we actually zoom out, we'll see something very interesting.",
  "The word that pops up is collaboration.",
  "All right.",
  "It's a long one.",
  "I'll show it to you at the same time.",
  "Here we go!.",
  "After me, collaboration.",
  "Excellent!.",
  "Again.",
  "Collaboration.",
  "Great job!.",
  "Now collaboration, this just means the situation of two or more people working together to create or achieve the same thing.",
  "In English we say, collaboration.",
  "So once again, look at the image.",
  "It looks like these three individuals are coming together to work on one specific project, a collaboration.",
  "Now let's look at the example sentence.",
  "Here we go!.",
  "The three students were working in close collaboration to finish the project on time.",
  "I'll say it one more time.",
  "The three students were working in close collaboration to finish the project on time.",
  "Make sense, right?.",
  "Now let me give you the pattern you can use.",
  "Again, I want you to start using these real-life English words so that you can sound more like a native English speaker.",
  "Here's the sentence pattern.",
  "Almost forgot the word.",
  "Here we go!.",
  "\"A collaboration between...is required to...\" Once again, a collaboration between a group of individuals is required to accomplish a specific goal.",
  "So using this pattern I could say, a collaboration between Apple and Samsung is required to develop the new technology, right?.",
  "Using the pattern we can make a very good English sentence.",
  "Well now I think you know what time it is?.",
  "Yes, it is time for your next quiz.",
  "Here we go!.",
  "All right.",
  "So you've learned a lot.",
  "Let's get started with quiz question number one.",

  "All right.",
  "Question number two.",
  "Here we go!.",
  "You're doing a great job.",
  "They were all...on the routine they had to do for their performance.",
  "I'll read it one more time.",
  "They were all...on the routine they had to do for their performance.",
  "Five seconds.",
  "Time, what's the answer?.",
  "Yes!.",
  "You got it.",
  "They were all focused on the routine they had to do for their performance.",
  "All right.",
  "Question number three.",

  "Last question.",
  "Question number five.",
  "Are you going to get all of them right?.",
  "Here we go!.",
  "The new airport is a...between two of the best architects in the country.",
  "Five seconds starts now.",
  "Time.",
  "Did you get the hint?.",
  "Excellent!.",
  "Collaboration.",
  "The new airport is a collaboration between two of the best architects in the country.",
  "Excellent job!.",
  "You are amazing!.",
  "Man, I really hope you learned a lot from this lesson.",
  "I hope you're able to use each and every word today at least one time.",
  "I can't wait to talk to you.",
  "Have a wonderful week but as always remember to speak English.",
  "You still there?.",
  "You know what time it is?.",
  "It's story time.",
  "Hey!.",
  "I said it's story time.",
  "All right.",
  "So, I want to tell you guys something that happened to me that had me and my friends rolling.",
  "All right!.",
  "So, I have had many roommates.",
  "I've lived with a lot of people between college and being a missionary in South Korea.",
  "I've had to live with many different people in different apartments and different dorm rooms and I'm okay with everyone, right!.",
  "But I had one roommate that honestly from the moment I met this roommate, I did not like this roommate.",
  "So let me explain what happened.",
  "So, I moved into a new apartment when I was in South Korea and I already had one roommate.",
  "She and I even to this day, we're still extremely close friends and we were happy.",
  "Again, we were getting to know each other as we were setting up our rooms and while we were talking one day, we realized that we had another roommate.",
  "Now, initially she and I thought that we were the only ones that we were gonna be living together, right?.",
  "But one day when we were sitting in the kitchen, we realized that we had quite a few roommates.",
  "Now, if you're following along, I think you know where this story is going.",
  "You see my friend and I, I'm a very clean person.",
  "My friend is also, I can say even now, a very clean person but when we moved into the apartment, the previous individuals were not as clean.",
  "So our new roommates were hundreds of roaches, even thinking about it makes my flesh crawl.",
  "You guys can look that one up.",
  "Now, I wanna tell you again about a specific roommate.",
  "Again, there were many roaches and we had to figure out how we were gonna get rid of the roaches.",
  "So she and I, we were terrified.",
  "We did not like roaches, right?.",
  "So we would clean every day, clean the kitchen, clean the bathroom.",
  "We scrubbed everything but again the previous tenants, the previous individuals, unfortunately, had not kept a clean apartment so these new roommates were there.",
  "So one night after spending all day cleaning, my friend and I, my roommate, the actual roommate and I were both tired and she went to bed and I went to my room.",
  "So I went inside my room and I closed my door.",
  "I changed my clothes, getting ready to go to bed and I opened my drawer.",
  "I needed to get some socks and when I opened my drawer, that's when I met my other roommate sitting on top of my clothes was one single roach in my drawer.",
  "On top of the clothes but the interesting thing was when I opened the drawer, he wasn't scared.",
  "I opened the drawer and I was literally about this close, about that close to him, but I had been so traumatized I didn't even scream.",
  "I looked at the roach and the roach looked back at me like, \"Hey girl, what's up?.",
  "I see you moved in.",
  "Your room looks nice and I actually started talking to the roach.",
  "True story y'all!.",
  "I said, \"Here's the deal.",
  "Apparently you're a new roommate, as long as I never see you again, we're not gonna have a problem.\" And I feel like the roach said, \"Okay.\" I literally closed the drawer back and I got in my bed and went to sleep.",
  "Now listen, I can laugh about this now.",
  "Praise God.",
  "A few weeks later, we were able to get rid of all the roaches.",
  "It was a very traumatizing experience.",
  "We had to call family members in America to get some tips and tricks.",
  "We eventually got rid of all of those roommates but whenever we talk about that night and that specific roommate, \"Man, it makes my friends and I laughed so hard.",
  "We always roll when we talked about that situation.\" So maybe you've also had an unwanted roommate and maybe you've had to figure out ways of getting rid of that roommate.",
  "A lot of times you're traumatizing experience later on when you think about it, you actually can laugh about it.",
  "I hope you guys enjoyed the story and I'll talk to you guys next time."
