  "p04 REAL LIFE ENGLISH SERIES.",
  "Hey, welcome to part four of the real life English series.",
  "My goal as your teacher is to help you sound more like a native English.",
  "In order to do that, you must learn real life English.",
  "And that's what I'm going to teach you in today's lesson.",
  "Are you ready?.",
  "Well, then I'm teacher.",
  "Tiffani let's jump right in.",
  "All right.",
  "So I want to show you a picture really quickly.",
  "Now this picture shows you something that so many native English speakers love, and you probably love it.",
  "This is a picture of some delicious food, but you see if I was looking at this in real life, I would say scrumptious one more time after me, watch my mouth scrumptious.",
  "Excellent.",
  "One more time.",
  "Scrumptious.",
  "Very good.",
  "Now, when I look at that cake and all of the things on top, As a native English speaker.",
  "My first response is to say, Ooh whee!.",
  "This cake looks scrumptious.",
  "Now you may have some troubles with your pronunciation, but don't worry.",
  "Remember you can always download the English with Tiffani app.",
  "The link is right in the description, and I have a few lessons in there about pronunciation.",
  "But you're probably wondering teacher.",
  "What does scrumptious mean?.",
  "So let me explain.",
  "Scrumptious just means extremely, extremely tasty.",
  "I want you to think about your favorite food, maybe it's macaroni and cheese.",
  "Maybe it's something that is specifically unique to your culture.",
  "Think about that dish and how your mouth starts to water.",
  "That's because it's delicious or.",
  "Scrumptious.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Now let me give you an example sentence.",
  "Here we go.",
  "The cake she made was scrumptious.",
  "Makes sense right now.",
  "What I want you to do is in the comment section right now, I want you to tell me something about your culture of food that is very unique to your culture.",
  "And tell me that it's scrumptious, make your own sentence and put it in the comment section.",
  "Remember, real life English.",
  "Now this is something that I want you to use on a regular basis, but let me show you a sentence pattern right now.",
  "When you write your comment, if you need help, you can use this sentence pattern.",
  "Here we go.",
  "The blank, the name of the food was extremely scrumptious.",
  "Very simple.",
  "Right now.",
  "Look how I would use this pattern to make a sentence.",
  "The banana nut bread.",
  "My mom made was extremely scrumptious.",
  "Makes sense right?.",
  "Now at the end, don't go anywhere.",
  "I'm going to tell you a story for story time, and this story is going to be related to banana nut bread.",
  "So don't go anywhere.",
  "So scrumptious something that you like.",
  "That's very delicious.",
  "It's scrumptious makes sense.",
  "All right.",
  "Very good.",
  "Now let me show you the next real English word.",
  "So we're still looking at the same picture, but this time I go down a little further and I see this chocolate fudge and I say drizzle after me drizzle.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Watch me.",
  "Drizzle.",
  "Very good.",
  "Now, what does this word drizzle mean?.",
  "And why do native English speakers use this word?.",
  "You see drizzle means to pour liquid slowly over something, especially in a line, a thin line or in small drops.",
  "So again, we saw the cake, it looked scrumptious, and then we saw the chocolate fudge, just coming down on the side, we say they drizzled chocolate.",
  "Maybe you like to bake or cook.",
  "And you like to drizzle things on your food.",
  "Huh?.",
  "All right.",
  "So let me give you an example sentence.",
  "The chef drizzled the syrup over the pancakes, you know, true story.",
  "This past weekend on Sunday, I actually had my family and my friends over and I actually cooked food for them.",
  "And I made something that required them to drizzle some syrup over their food.",
  "Makes sense.",
  "Right now, let me give you a pattern that you can use so that you can use this real English.",
  "Easily.",
  "Okay.",
  "So here's the pattern I like to drizzle say what it is over and then say the food item.",
  "For example, I like to drizzle syrup over waffles.",
  "Makes sense right now.",
  "Look.",
  "I like to drizzle agave.",
  "Agave is a type of natural syrup over my cinnamon pancakes, man.",
  "Can't you just imagine eating something delicious and then drizzling some liquid, some sweetener on the top.",
  "We say drizzle in English.",
  "Now, before I go to the next one, I want to give you your first quiz.",
  "I hope you're ready.",
  "I hope you're ready.",
  "All right.",
  "We have quiz number one.",
  "I want to make sure you're understanding these real life English vocabulary words.",
  "So you're going to have five seconds to answer.",
  "I want you to think quickly.",
  "All right.",
  "We learned drizzle and we also learned what was the.",
  "Scrumptious.",
  "Very good.",
  "All right.",
  "Here's the first question.",
  "And again, you will have only five seconds.",
  "So here we go.",
  "The first question is my niece asked me if she could the syrup over her food.",
  "Five seconds time.",
  "All right.",
  "What's the.",
  "Yes, you got it.",
  "Excellent.",
  "She asked me if she could drizzle the syrup over her food.",
  "Excellent.",
  "All right, now let's look at question number two.",
  "Here we go.",
  "Now again, I'll start the timer over the cupcakes she made were what's the answer?.",
  "Five seconds.",

  "What's the answer.",
  "Excellent.",
  "You got it.",
  "They were scrumptious.",
  "Oh.",
  "I brought it back.",
  "They were scrumptious again, extremely tasty, very delicious.",
  "So we have scrumptious and drizzle.",
  "Now, if we go back to our image of this wonderful cake, we're going to see something else that pops up.",
  "We have drizzle, we have scrumptious, but when we go to the next part of this picture, look what happens.",
  "Now we have visually appealing again after me visually appealing.",
  "Yeah.",
  "That V sound can be tricky for the V sound.",
  "All I want you to do is put your front teeth on your bottom lip and vibrate.",
  "So excellent.",
  "Again, I teach all of this in the English with Tiffani app, my app, click the link in the description.",
  "So again, visually appealing.",

  "Now, what does visually appealing actually mean?.",
  "So visually appealing this expression means to look good or attractive.",
  "Something looks good or attractive.",
  "Hopefully you can see appealing.",
  "There you go.",

  "Now that brother is visually appealing or when you make something delicious, something scrumptious, some food, and you want to make sure it looks good.",
  "You drizzle the dressing over the salad, you place different pieces at just the right spots.",
  "You want to make sure your food.",
  "Visually appealing again, real life English that we as native English speakers use.",
  "So let me give you an example sentence.",
  "Here we go.",
  "It's always important to make sure your food, that your food is visually appealing.",
  "That makes sense, right?.",
  "When something looks good, it's usually a lot tastier.",
  "Right?.",
  "Okay.",
  "So let me give you an example, pattern sentence.",
  "Here we go.",
  "I want to make sure that my, dot dot dot, is or are visually appealing.",
  "That's the pattern.",
  "Remember you can write down the pattern, but don't worry if you're not able to take notes.",

  "And can you imagine having an ice cream cone set inside the ice cream scoop right on top of that waffle cone?.",
  "You're on a diet.",
  "Maybe you're watching your figure.",
  "You're trying to stay in shape and you know, you shouldn't have that ice cream cone.",
