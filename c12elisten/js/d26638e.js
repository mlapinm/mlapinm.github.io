  "once upon a time when humans and animals still spoke the same language.",
  "the jungle was governed by a righteous and scrupulously fair lord.",
  "he raised a lion named victor.",
  "as the lord was so strict victor always obeyed his orders.",
  "at no time dared him to mess up.",
  "during his time the jungle was always luxuriant and all species lived a happy life.",
  "the vegetation was also diversity with a multitude of precious thousand-year-old mushrooms that can cure all diseases.",
  "one day the jungle lord had to attend a meeting in heaven.",
  "he carefully chained the lion into the cave and told him.",
  "i'm going to heaven for a while.",
  "here i prepare enough food and water for you until i come back.",
  "you have to stay inside without escaping to devastate.",
  "remember that if you disobey you will have to regret.",
  "yes my lord.",
  "he's really gone from now on no one can control me anymore.",
  "stay inside this cave you think i'm that stupid going out to dominate the jungle is a much better idea.",
  "after using his sharp teeth to nibble the rope he happily roared to wake up the whole jungle.",
  "now i am free.",
  "without the control of the lord victor revealed himself into a greedy and evil lion.",
  "he bullied weaker animals with his strength and quickly became the master of the jungle.",
  "panic spreaded through the jungle as the lion appeared.",
  "the jungle thus turned to be bleak and desolate.",
  "but things hadn't stopped there.",
  "victor also got on other villages nerves because of his manner.",
  "the hunters thus boiled with anger.",
  "they decided to place a giant iron cage and hang a piece of fresh meat inside to trap victor.",
  "what a delicious piece of meat just at the moment when i'm so hungry.",
  "victor was so cunning after making sure that there was no danger around he slowly came into the cage.",
  "immediately the iron cage door slammed down locked him inside.",
  "the greedy lion was caught in the trap.",
  "startling enough victor tied in vain to find a way to get out because the iron door was entirely rigid.",
  "it's bad how could i escape from the inside.",
  "can't wait for death like this.",
  "i have to do something.",
  "at that moment victor saw a young man coming.",
  "that was rowan a young gentle and honest physician.",
  "he came from a very far away village to search for precious thousand-year-old mushrooms to cure all diseases.",
  "that's why rowan did not know about the existence of the evil lion.",
  "i've just come up with a good idea in that way i can not only escape.",
  "but also have a good meal.",
  "here i will kill two birds with one stone.",
  "hey you good man.",
  "turned out a lion who has been trapped.",
  "he can't harm me at all.",
  "but how pitiful he is.",
  "i'm victor a miserable lion.",
  "i have been starving for days.",
  "but all i could do is to lie here and wait for death.",
  "please could you give me something to eat.",
  "poor you i only have some bread left to eat along the way just take it.",
  "what a good man thank you for saving me.",
  "how can i ever repay you for all your kindness.",
  "i'm rowan a physician from a far away land.",
  "i come here to find the precious mushroom.",
  "if you know where they are please tell me the way to get there.",
  "of course i do know but you can't go there alone.",
  "since there are many ferocious animals around they would harm you.",
  "really but i have to find the precious mushrooms to cure the patients who are waiting for me to return.",
  "do you know what i should do now.",
  "i really want to help you but now i cannot do anything in this situation.",
  "let me think ah i know the way.",
  "what's that first you should open the iron cage and let me out.",
  "then i'll show you where the precious mushrooms are.",
  "i swear that no animal can touch a hair on your head if you stand by my side.",
  "then you can pick as many mushrooms as you want.",
  "but what if you eat me right after no way.",
  "such a shame on me why do you think so bad about me.",
  "i owe you a favor for feeding me opening the door of the cage and releasing me.",
  "how on earth can i eat you.",
  "seeing victor was crying it made rowan's heart soften.",
  "he gradually believed the mischievous lion.",
  "is it true can i trust you.",
  "i swear to the mighty lord of the jungle.",
  "if rowan saves me from here i will never eat you.",
  "i will lead you to find precious mushrooms and protect you by all my heart from evil animals in the jungle.",
  "but you're still a lion.",
  "yes and i am also the master of the jungle.",
  "i have never told a single lie before.",
  "if you let me out i will owe you a deep debt of gratitude for my entire life.",
  "all right i'll trust you this time.",
  "rowan tugged the rope that was attached to the iron cage door.",
  "as the door was gradually open victor immediately jumped outside.",
  "i got out of the trap now i'm free again.",
  "stop it your roar has left me almost death.",
  "oh dear my roar annoyed you sorry but what can you do.",
  "now i not only want to roar happily.",
  "but also want to eat you.",
  "what you you just swore to the lord.",
  "now you want to go back on your words.",
  "you don't think that you will get retribution.",
  "but i have not said that if i broke my word i would be punished.",
  "i don't want to do so.",
  "but my hungry stomach will swallow it all no matter what it is.",
  "so it turned out that all those words were a lie.",
  "not really that i have been starving for several days is absolutely true.",
  "and i need to regain the strength to return to the cave.",
  "therefore you should devote your life to me.",
  "anyway thank you for your kindness.",
  "victor let out an ear splitting roar and came towards rowan.",
  "he wanted to drive rowan to extremes.",
  "now you're cornered.",
  "i should never have helped you.",
  "a cunning lion like you will never deserve my kindness.",
  "right but sorry it's too late.",
  "a light flashed in the blink of an eye.",
  "fortunately the jungle lord came back in time.",
  "it's not good how could he come back at this moment.",
  "was it my blatant oath.",
  "no i have to find a way to hide the truth.",
  "i will not let him punish me.",
  "i am the jungle lord what's wrong with my lion.",
  "just tell me all the things.",
  "so you are the mighty jungle lord the thing is.",
  "oh my great lord in the jungle.",
  "when i was taking a rest in the cave this guy came and disturbed my sleep.",
  "he also had the intention of chasing me away from the cave to take my food.",
  "therefore i had no choice but to chase after him and break the promise.",
  "no that's not true this lion.",
  "if what you've said is true.",
  "you can take revenge on him.",
  "i can forgive you for not obeying my order.",
  "great finally i can fool the lord so talented i am that not only.",
  "i wasn't scolded but i get a yummy meal as well.",
  "so am i going to be eaten by this lion.",
  "people keep saying that the lord of the jungle is righteous and impartial.",
  "actually he has just spoiled his pet.",
  "but i will never forgive your shiftiness betraying the person who saved you in the tribulation.",
  "my lord i i.",
  "don't worry i've already known everything.",
  "i promise to make a fair judgment.",
  "victor i heard whatever you swore by my own ear will you stop lying.",
  "i told you to stay in the cave until i got back.",
  "yet how dare you escape and make a fuss.",
  "because of you no one can stay in peace.",
  "my lord i was so foolish but that was my first time when i disobeyed your order.",
  "please forgive me.",
  "when you were trapped this kind guy fed you and tried to escape you.",
  "yet you have not only broken your promise.",
  "but intended to harm him.",
  "have i ever told you to behave like that.",
  "i was so wrong it's all my fault.",
  "i swear that i don't dare to do it one more time.",
  "you make me so upset i will inflict punishment on you to make you more understanding.",
  "the lord's iron cage locked victor inside despite his begging.",
  "and crying the god of the jungle just gave rowan advice.",
  "this is also a valuable lesson for you.",
  "it's good to be kind and help others.",
  "but never forget to stay alert because danger can be anywhere.",
  "thank you and also sorry because i used to think that you were deliberately biased towards your pet.",
  "how benevolent you are when looking for precious millennial mushrooms to cure others diseases.",
  "here i will give you a basket of precious mushrooms as a reward for your kind heart.",
  "right after that he saw him taking a basket of mushrooms.",
  "that's great thank you very much almighty jungle lord.",
  "a light flashed the jungle lord and the iron cage with victor inside disappeared.",
  "since then no one has ever seen the evil lion anymore.",
  "under the rule of the mighty lord of the jungle the forest was full of vitality as before.",
  "all species turned back together and lived in harmony.",
  "rowan came back home and distributed the mushrooms to all of his poor patients.",
  "therefore he was deeply respected by everyone.",
  "he always remembered the jungle lord's lesson in mind that he should never be kind to the shifty ones.",
  "the kind-hearted guy lived happily forever after."
