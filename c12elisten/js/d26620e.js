  "once upon a time there was a king.",
  "but where he reigned and what he was called no one can remember.",
  "he had only a daughter who was famed for her beauty through all the land.",
  "however she had been unable to speak ever since birth she looked sad all the time.",
  "and no doctor had ever been able to cure her which made the king so very sad.",
  "he decided to summon the most famous prophet of his kingdom to ask if there was a cure for the princess [Music].",
  "he asked my wise prophet is there any way to help my dear daughter to talk.",
  "the prophet replied.",
  "your majesty it's very complicated only the magic potion from the witch in the far woods can cure her now.",
  "the king smiled slightly having been given a sign of hope.",
  "so he had it proclaimed throughout his kingdom.",
  "that whoever would bring his daughter the magic potion which could make her talk could marry her.",
  "this became known to a peasant.",
  "he was so excited that he came home to inform his son hans.",
  "hans is a handsome gentle and honest man who was deeply loved by his father.",
  "hans was reading a book when his father entered the house.",
  "he said to hans.",
  "the king is looking for a magic potion to cure the princess why don't you go to the woods to try.",
  "perhaps you will be able to find it and then you can marry her and be king someday [Music].",
  "hans listened to his father's advice.",
  "then started on his journey.",
  "he walked and walked and kept going until one day in the woods he met an old woman dressed in rags.",
  "she said in a pitiful tone kind boy.",
  "i'm so hungry do you have anything for me to eat.",
  "i haven't eaten anything for two days.",
  "with a kind heart hans replied.",
  "i have only two loaves of bread left please take it.",
  "i will gather some fruits later.",
  "then he gave her the bread.",
  "she asked him.",
  "what are you doing here in the middle of the woods.",
  "hans replied.",
  "i come here to find the magic potion which can help the princess talk.",
  "no sooner had hans uttered these last words.",
  "then the woman revealed herself to be a witch.",
  "she had a sinister smile as she said.",
  "kind man it was just a test for you.",
  "many greedy men had gone by.",
  "and i had turned them all into insects already.",
  "you are very kind.",
  "i will help you make this magic potion.",
  "that's great thank you so much.",
  "but on one condition.",
  "condition.",
  "yes you have to bring me three feathers from the tail of the fire phoenix who knows all.",
  "he is now living on the top of the highest mountain.",
  "hans froze filled both with fear and joy at the same time.",
  "he thanked the witch and immediately left the woods heading to that mountain.",
  "he continued forward in the evening he came to a castle [Music].",
  "the lord of the castle agreed with much pleasure.",
  "and asked where hans was going.",
  "and replied.",
  "to the fire phoenix who knows everything.",
  "really i have lost the key to my father's treasure.",
  "so you might be so good as to ask him where it is.",
  "yes indeed most certainly i'll do that.",
  "he kept heading toward the mountain the next morning.",
  "then he came to a river.",
  "and instead of a ferry boat a giant man was there who had to carry everybody across the river.",
  "he asked hans.",
  "man where do you want to go.",
  "to the fire phoenix who knows all.",
  "he ordered hans.",
  "then when you get to him please ask him why i am forced to carry everybody across the river.",
  "yes indeed most certainly i'll do that.",
  "then the giant man opened his hand for hans to jump on and carried him across the river.",
  "hans kept going and finally he arrived at the phoenix's house but only his wife was home not the fire phoenix himself.",
  "she was standing in front of the house looking at the stranger for a while.",
  "she told hans to come inside and asked him what he wanted [Music].",
  "there upon he told her everything that he had to get the feathers from the phoenix's tail.",
  "as well as the questions that the people had asked him on the way there.",
  "then the woman said.",
  "you'd better leave no human can speak to him he will burn you all into ashes and i can do nothing to help you.",
  "it was not easy for hans to come here so he did not want to leave as easily as that.",
  "suddenly his mind came up with a risky idea.",
  "after the wife had closed the door hans snuck into the bedroom of the phoenix's house.",
  "in the evening before sleep the phoenix said to his wife.",
  "honey i smell a human.",
  "yes one was here today he had asked too much then i told him to go away.",
  "what did he ask.",
  "he told me all kinds of things that in one castle.",
  "they had lost the key of a treasure and could find it nowhere.",
  "oh the fools the key lies in the warehouse under a log of wood behind the door.",
  "there is also a daughter of this family.",
  "who has been ill for long without my tail feather she will have no chance to live.",
  "and then he also said that there was a river with a giant who was forced to carry everybody across.",
  "oh the fool if he only put one man down in the middle he would never have to carry another one across.",
  "but his feet are now sticking to the bottom of this river without my tail feather.",
  "he can only stand there for the rest of his life.",
  "under the bed hans was really delighted with the information he had heard.",
  "in the middle of the night when the phoenix was snoring loudly.",
  "hans reached out and plucked out one feather from his tail.",
  "the phoenix startled.",
  "hans patiently waited until the phoenix started snoring loudly again.",
  "and plucked another feather from his tail.",
  "right after he got the third feather the sun began to shine through the windows.",
  "early the next morning the phoenix got up and flew away.",
  "then hans came forth from under the bed.",
  "and he had three beautiful feathers in his hands.",
  "hans quickly found the way to leave.",
  "after getting out of the house he went back to the river.",
  "the giant asked.",
  "did the fire phoenix tell you anything.",
  "yes but you should carry me across first.",
  "and then i will tell you.",
  "so the giant carried him across.",
  "after his feet were on the ground hans told the giant.",
  "you need only to drop someone down in the middle of the river.",
  "then you will never have to carry people over anymore.",
  "but if you want to leave here forever just take this feather.",
  "although it was regretful but the kind man still gave the giant a tail feather of the fire phoenix.",
  "full of joy he said to hans.",
  "thank you so much.",
  "these are two packs of pearl that i found at the bottom of this river.",
  "please take it as my special thanks to you.",
  "hans tried to refuse but the man wouldn't let him go without receiving it [Music].",
  "when hans got to the castle that he had lodged in before.",
  "he informed the lord of the castle about the place where he could find the key.",
  "the lord immediately told the servant to go and check whether there was a key or not.",
  "a few minutes later the servant came back with a key.",
  "the lord was really happy.",
  "hans added.",
  "you also have a daughter who has been ill for long right.",
  "how do you know my daughter has been ill for years.",
  "i also have asked many doctors to come here to help but there is no way you could get better.",
  "this is a phoenix feather which can cure all diseases just bring it to your daughter.",
  "Hans said and then gave him the feather.",
  "he told the servant to take a wagon and load it with two chests of gold as a reward and hans was forced to take it.",
  "back to the woods hans was very upset then he brought the last feather to the witch and said.",
  "i'm really sorry i had all three feathers.",
  "but i used them to help others and there is only one left.",
  "is there any different way to make the potion for the princess.",
  "suddenly the witch turned into a fairy and once again hans couldn't believe his eyes.",
  "she kindly smiled and said.",
  "i knew everything because they are all the challenges that i set up to test your kindness.",
  "you are totally a brave gentle and kind man.",
  "you deserve everything.",
  "and this is your reward.",
  "she opened her hand there was a shining golden bottle inside.",
  "she added.",
  "you can bring this potion to the palace to cure the princess.",
  "then hans went back to the palace with two treasure chests filled with two packs of pearl.",
  "he talked to the gatekeepers and was allowed to enter the palace.",
  "hans got the potion out of his bag.",
  "the king was joyful when he saw the shining magic potion.",
  "and told hans to give it to the princess.",
  "after taking the potion the face of the princess started to glow.",
  "and she said happily to the king.",
  "father i can speak.",
  "the king was so happy.",
  "but when he learned that hans was only the son of a poor farmer.",
  "he looked a little bit disappointed as he said.",
  "you are from a poor family how could you get such treasures.",
  "hans replied calmly.",
  "your majesty thanks to the fire phoenix.",
  "i can get all of these treasures.",
  "the king thought he himself could make such things useful.",
  "he'd talk to himself.",
  "the phoenix must own tons of treasure.",
  "i shall make him my pet bird and take all of the gold.",
  "the king didn't want to reveal the secret to anyone so he set out on his own way to catch the phoenix.",
  "but when he got to the river it happened that he was the very first man to be there after hans.",
  "so the giant put him down in the middle of it and went away.",
  "and the King was drowned with an honest and kind heart.",
  "hans not only could marry the beautiful princess but also became the king.",
  "after that hans and the beautiful princess live happily ever after."
