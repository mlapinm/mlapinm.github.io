  "they shouldn't be too light and rattle when you shake them.",
  "ah okay let me see most of the chestnuts seem fine and not spoiled.",
  "yeah i like to shop at the farmer's market because most of the food there is fresh.",
  "right i agree.",
  "oh i just found three chestnuts that are cracked.",
  "it's best if we throw them away.",
  "okay what's next.",
  "we need to wash them properly and dry them off because we'll touch the shells when eating.",
  "alright done.",
  "next we'll make an x-shaped cut on the shelf.",
  "this step is really important.",
  "because it will prevent the chestnuts from exploding when being roasted.",
  "ah that's why.",
  "then we'll put them in the oven right.",
  "yeah it'll take 10 to 20 minutes.",
  "we'll wait till shells burst open and the chestnuts look golden brown.",
