  "Intro.",
  "drills.",
  "no.",
  "drills are a great way for beginners.",
  "to practice the same thing over and over.",
  "and it helps you to see your progress.",
  "because one week the drill will be difficult.",
  "and the next week you'll be like hey this draw actually feels a bit.",
  "easier.",
  "they're also great for more advanced skaters.",
  "because it gets rid of.",
  "what i call the bambi legs.",
  "when you first put your skates on.",
  "the drills are going to cover a lot of different skills.",
  "so the best thing to do.",
  "is for me to link the major skills as we go like the bubbles.",
  "and the pushing and the stroke skating.",
  "but what i'll do is put the playlist for the beginner skills.",
  "at the end of the video.",
  "so you should be able to find everything you need in there.",
  "Drill 1 - Bubbles & Stopping.",
  "so the first drill is going to be a nice easy.",
  "all the beginners should be able to follow along.",
  "i'm going to do three snake patterns and then a plow stop.",
  "arms out knees bent.",
  "so it's just helping you to remember your posture.",
  "eyes forward weight on the outside.",
  "and you'll come to a stop.",
  "Drill 2 - Bubbles, Toe Touch and Stop.",
  "so for this one we're going to do one snake.",
  "then touch your toes another snake.",
  "and then plough.",
  "arms soft knees.",
  "touch your toes.",
  "another snake and then a plow.",
  "Drill 3 - Bubbles, Cannon Ball and Stop.",
  "the next one.",
  "i'm going to do a bubble.",
  "and then i'm going to get into the cannonball position.",
  "because the cannonball is a really important one to muscle memory.",
  "because when you feel the wobble.",
  "you're going to cannonball.",
  "so it's a great one to put into your everyday drills.",
  "don't forget your posture.",
  "bubble.",
  "cannonball.",
  "bubble and then a plow.",
  "Drill 4 - Balancing.",
  "this one is great if you want to work on your balance.",
  "so i'm going to do a bubble.",
  "and then i'm going to stand on one leg.",
  "then another bubble and stand on the other leg.",
  "now because you're learning to balance.",
  "you can then do a t stop at the end.",
  "Drill 5 - Stroke SKating Progression.",
  "once you've got your balancing.",
  "one you can progress to doing the stroke skating version.",
  "so in the balancing.",
  "i was putting my knee up.",
  "so in this one we're going to put our leg back.",
  "so it's bubble.",
  "and then leg back.",
  "bubble and leg back.",
  "and then stop.",
  "don't forget you can also stop on alternate feet.",
  "as well to practice each foot.",
  "Drill 6 - T-Push, Stroke Skating, Stop.",
  "the next one is going to be the stroke skating.",
  "now you might find this easier to do it from a rolling start initially.",
  "because doing it from a t push is quite advanced and quite frustrating.",
  "so just bear that in mind arms out knees bent.",
  "this is really going to help you get your pushing.",
  "and i'm going to do a t-stop at the end.",
  "Tips.",
  "so it may seem that i've shown you absolutely loads of these.",
  "and it's really overwhelming.",
  "but when you start practicing.",
  "they do become part of your routine.",
  "and they're really easy to remember.",
  "and they only take a few minutes.",
  "and it really helps you to gauge your progress.",
  "How To Use Drills.",
  "so here i'm just using the drills.",
  "as a bit of a warm up.",
  "at the start of the skating session.",
  "but if you're still learning you can repeat the drill over and over.",
  "until it starts to feel comfortable.",
  "and this will also help to build your muscle memory.",
  "and improve your skating.",
  "uh.",
  "Make Up Your Own.",
  "the great thing with these.",
  "is you can make up your own depending.",
  "on what you want to practice.",
  "so if i wanted to practice jumps.",
  "i could do two pushes.",
  "then a jump and then two pushes and a stop.",
  "Bye Bye.",
  "the drills i've covered in this video.",
  "will really help you with your forward skating.",
  "because we start with bubbles.",
  "and then we get to stroke skating at the end.",
  "and also stopping which is that one skill.",
  "that everyone goes.",
  "i can't stop so hopefully.",
  "these will help you.",
  "stick around.",
  "and i'm going to put the playlist up at the very end of the video.",
  "i'm katie you've been watching skatey.",
  "and i'll see you next time.",
  "bye.",

  "Intro.",
  "take your cornering from this.",
  "to this.",
  "we're going to talk about some really easy cornering techniques.",
  "so you don't need to be able to do crossovers for this cornering.",
  "because lots of people find those quite difficult.",
  "so this is absolute beginner.",
  "don't hit the wall cornering.",
  "so you're a beginner at the rink.",
  "you're doing your marching you're like yes.",
  "life is good.",
  "i'm moving.",
  "i'm staying upright my knees are bent.",
  "and you get to a corner.",
  "and you're like okay.",
  "so how do i march round the corner.",
  "so you can carry on marching.",
  "but you need to think about your edges.",
  "Using Edges.",
  "so let's talk about edges.",
  "an edge would be leaning on your little toe.",
  "or your big toe.",
  "big toe edge is an inside edge.",
  "and a little toe edge is an outside edge.",
  "so when i'm moving.",
  "it's going to be little toe big toe see the arc.",
  "little toe big toe.",
  "and i'm naturally going to go in a circle.",
  "because i'm leaning on the sides of my skate.",
  "which makes my wheels turn.",
  "it doesn't matter which direction you're going in.",
  "so whichever way your rink makes you skate.",
  "the foot on the inside of your circle.",
  "will always be little toe.",
  "and the foot on the outside will be big toe.",
  "and that gives you the arc.",
  "Arms.",
  "so far we've just spoken about the feet.",
  "but none of this is going to happen without using your shoulders.",
  "and your hips.",
  "so your shoulders must be pointing into your circle.",
  "and that's going to lean you.",
  "and push you around as well.",
  "so no matter which direction you're going in.",
  "arms into the circle.",
  "and that will help to push you onto your edges.",
  "there is an even simpler version of this one.",
  "so if.",
  "you're still at the bubble stage.",
  "and you're not comfortable to lift your feet.",
  "i can show you that version as well.",
  "Cornering Without Lifting Your Feet.",
  "let's go.",
  "so i'm doing my bubbles.",
  "and i get to the corner.",
  "and i can put my feet together.",
  "or i can stagger.",
  "i'm going to turn my shoulders into my circle.",
  "and lean on the big toe.",
  "and the little toe.",
  "and it will take me around the corner.",
  "time for a quick tip.",
  "Quick Tip - Truck Adjustment.",
  "in order to get an edge.",
  "your wheels need to flex.",
  "so if i lean on my big toe.",
  "my wheels will flex together.",
  "and if i lean on my little toe.",
  "my wheels flex together like this.",
  "now if you're doing that.",
  "and you're having a lot of trouble.",
  "and your wheels are not flexing.",
  "then you may need to make some adjustments to your skate.",
  "to get the flex.",
  "that i'm talking about you need to make sure.",
  "that your trucks are adjusted correctly.",
  "now often when a skate arrives.",
  "everything is very very tight because it's been tightened by machine.",
  "so before you make any adjustments.",
  "if you're already getting a level of flex.",
  "then it's best not to mess about with things.",
  "but if you're really pushing.",
  "really hard to get any movement.",
  "then this is one i would recommend to adjust them.",
  "so each set of wheels is mounted on a kingpin.",
  "which holds the truck and the cushions.",
  "the cushions are these rubbery bits here.",
  "so this is what you need to adjust.",
  "so you need a spanner.",
  "and there's a nut in between at the very bottom.",
  "and now when you adjust this you literally adjust each one.",
  "a quarter of a turn.",
  "and then you skate.",
  "and see how it feels.",
  "because a little adjustment makes a big difference to the skating.",
  "if you have one of the popular skate brands.",
  "the moxie particularly the beach bunny.",
  "the stock cushions are known to be rather hard.",
  "so if you're having a lot of trouble.",
  "and loosening your nut on your truck isn't helping.",
  "you can replace those cushions for the power dyne reactors.",
  "and that does help a lot.",
  "so now you should be able to handle those corners with ease.",
  "Bye Bye.",
  "so we've mentioned in this video about edges.",
  "and they are one of the most important skills.",
  "you can learn in skating.",
  "so really really concentrate on leaning on the big toe and the little toe.",
  "to get the feel of them because that.",
  "is going to help you so so much of your skating.",
  "that's it i'm katie.",
  "you've been watching skatey.",
  "and i'll see you next time.",
  "bye.",
  "Outtakes.",

  "Intro.",
  "in this video we're going to cover seven reasons.",
  "why your skating might not be progressing.",
  "as quickly as you'd like.",
  "and obviously i'm going to tell you how to fix them.",
  "and if you stick around to the very end.",
  "we've got two bonus skills as well.",
  "Tip 1.",
  "the first thing we're going to talk about.",
  "is how to stand.",
  "so obviously you're going to draw on what you know.",
  "so obviously walking.",
  "so hit width apart.",
  "and you're going to do this.",
  "doesn't work for skating.",
  "so what do i recommend.",
  "is the stance that we call staggered stance in roller skating.",
  "so you choose whichever foot feels the most comfortable to go in front.",
  "and most of the weight goes on this back leg.",
  "and this is your staggered stance.",
  "now this will help you to balance.",
  "but it will also help you to absorb impacts.",
  "and if you feel a wobble from here.",
  "you can very easily take a knee.",
  "Tip 2.",
  "another thing we need to talk about is your arms.",
  "so these can really really help you.",
  "and they can also hinder you.",
  "so if you're trying to learn to skate.",
  "and they're flapping around.",
  "they're going to throw your balance.",
  "so the best thing to do is to put your arms out to the side.",
  "now i am a figure skater.",
  "so mine go up here.",
  "but if you want to be more comfortable.",
  "you can put them more sort of here.",
  "just to give you a bit of balance.",
  "and they really really help.",
  "so when you skate.",
  "you want to go opposite arm to leg.",
  "so if you're skating.",
  "it's this kind of action.",
  "is great no problem.",
  "what you don't want to do is twist.",
  "your body to a point that this arm.",
  "crosses your center line.",
  "because then what you're doing.",
  "is you're over rotating your top.",
  "and you're actually then throwing yourself back off.",
  "so think if you're going to skate like this.",
  "which is almost like a jog.",
  "which kind of works.",
  "keep each arm on its own half of your body.",
  "another really really important aspect of arms.",
  "is when you start to feel a fall.",
  "the natural thing is to helicopter the arms.",
  "try not to do that because that is going to exacerbate the fall.",
  "if you start to feel a wobble.",
  "it's best to get your arms out and get low.",
  "because getting these out will help you to regain your balance.",
  "Tip 3.",
  "so another really important thing.",
  "and thing that initially feels incredibly alien is your posture.",
  "because roller skating posture is kind of different to.",
  "what you may have done in the past.",
  "so when i say get low.",
  "it's about a knee bend.",
  "now you don't get low by bending at the waist.",
  "you get low by bending the knees.",
  "so if you think about your belly button.",
  "this is a really weird point but it works.",
  "you want your belly button down the middle of your skate.",
  "so if your belly button's too far back.",
  "your weight will be too far to the back of your skate.",
  "if your belly button's too far forward.",
  "it means you're too far forward.",
  "over the front of your skate.",
  "so if you think about bending your knees.",
  "and getting your belly button in the middle of your skate.",
  "that will make a really big difference.",
  "so if we go back to the staggered stance from the beginning.",
  "so you've got a nice knee bend.",
  "your belly buttons over the middle of the skate.",
  "that most of the weight is on which is this back one.",
  "so you're skating you've got your arms out.",
  "this is great posture.",
  "and if you have a wobble.",
  "or you hit a stone.",
  "you've got a chance to save yourself.",
  "because your weight spread.",
  "and you can take the knee from here.",
  "and you can hopefully save wobble.",
  "so this is a great place to start.",
  "Tip 4.",
  "when you start skating.",
  "it's not unusual to get this kind of short choppy skating.",
  "so let me show you what i mean.",
  "you get this kind of short choppy strides.",
  "but do you know.",
  "what if you've never skated before.",
  "the fact that you're standing up and moving.",
  "i'm pretty sure that's a whim.",
  "but you want to take it from there.",
  "and progress from there.",
  "so think about back to the belly button idea.",
  "when you're doing these short little steps.",
  "your belly button is in between your two skates.",
  "in order to commit your weight to one side.",
  "because what we want to do is.",
  "you want to hold each foot.",
  "and stride stride skating like this.",
  "to do that you need to put the belly button over the skate.",
  "and commit your weight to one of your skates.",
  "now this will happen slowly.",
  "so you'll find that you're able to do this more and more.",
  "and hang one side than the other.",
  "really important aspect of this is.",
  "when you do start lifting your foot.",
  "belly button over your foot.",
  "and you're like yes.",
  "i can lift this one don't lift it to the side.",
  "because it's gonna pull you back over.",
  "always lift this foot to the back.",
  "and that will help your balance your belly button.",
  "and everything in line.",
  "and this leg as well in line.",
  "i do have an entire video on striding.",
  "or stroke skating as it can be called.",
  "so when you're ready check that out.",
  "Tip 5.",
  "a major part of progressing as a skater.",
  "is to drill the weaker side.",
  "so everybody has a side that feels more comfortable.",
  "i do but everyone does.",
  "i am left footed.",
  "and i like to rotate clockwise.",
  "but lots of people like to go the other.",
  "way actually majority of people prefer the opposite direction.",
  "so when you're practicing things.",
  "make sure you drill the weaker side.",
  "and it may be that you need.",
  "to drill the weaker side twice as much as the easy side.",
  "but that will really make you an even all-round skater.",
  "and it will make a really big difference to your progress.",
  "so you remember when you're at school.",
  "Tip 6.",
  "and the teachers are like have you planned it.",
  "and you're like oh just want to do it so ballroom.",
  "i kind of agree that they were onto something.",
  "if you're going to go out for a skate.",
  "have a think about what you want to practice.",
  "so i think okay last time.",
  "i did manuals and i did bubbles.",
  "so this time i really need to practice my manuals again.",
  "but maybe i should watch a skatey video.",
  "and do one of her drills.",
  "so basically binge watch oh my god.",
  "plan out what you're gonna do.",
  "so when you get to your practice area.",
  "you don't waste any time watching videos.",
  "and things like that.",
  "when you get there you know.",
  "what you're gonna do.",
  "and it's gonna help you progression a lot quicker.",
  "Tip 7.",
  "so the last thing we need to talk about is equipment.",
  "now they always say a bad workman blames his tools.",
  "but in this case it might be true.",
  "if you have a pair of skates.",
  "that say are under the 50 pound mark.",
  "they tend to have a plastic plate.",
  "they're more of a toy.",
  "so if you think about this is actually a piece of sports equipment.",
  "there's no way you want to go.",
  "and spend two or three hundred pounds on your first pair of skates you don't know if you like it it's crazy.",
  "so a good way to try out skating for the first time.",
  "is to head to the rink.",
  "now i know the rink skates are a little bit spatty.",
  "you might want to wear a sock.",
  "but they're normally quite a good quality skate.",
  "and they give you an idea of what it's going to feel like.",
  "so i'm talking around the 100 pound mark.",
  "now this will give you a good skate.",
  "it will give you a metal alloy plate.",
  "a lot of the times.",
  "this will give you an adjustable toe stop.",
  "and the wheels and things like that.",
  "you can always swap the wheels out.",
  "so you don't need a separate pair of skates for indoors and outdoors.",
  "just change your wheels.",
  "and if you want to get into something like the dancing.",
  "like i was showing you the rhythm moves.",
  "you don't need to buy a skate like this.",
  "you can just take your toe stop out.",
  "and put in a jam plug.",
  "because if you're going to skate in the ring.",
  "they're going to want you to have a jam plug in.",
  "so there are ways.",
  "that you can save money in other areas.",
  "to get the better overall skate.",
  "and it will make a big big difference to your skating.",
  "Bonus Tip 1.",
  "so we've spoken about seven different things.",
  "that could be stopping you from progressing.",
  "and how to fix them.",
  "so we're now on to our bonus section.",
  "so the first bonus tip is to skate to music.",
  "because if you think about it the music's got to be.",
  "so if you're skating to the beat.",
  "you're going to stride evenly on each foot.",
  "and then as you get better.",
  "you can hold each stride for a count of two beats.",
  "so you're elongating your steps.",
  "and this will really really help in your skating.",
  "and the second tip.",
  "i'm going to show you is a really fun drill.",
  "so for this drill you will need three cones.",
  "Bonus Tip 2.",
  "my cones are at home i have used shoes.",
  "but that's great.",
  "because you can do the same thing.",
  "you don't need cones three of anything will do.",
  "so the first two cones.",
  "put my feet together and i'm gonna corner.",
  "don't forget your arms.",
  "so this is practicing both ways of cornering.",
  "so it's keeping you even.",
  "and now i'm going to do crossovers to here.",
  "and then crossovers round this cone shoe to here.",
  "and then i'm gonna do back to my two feet.",
  "and now this time i'm gonna do my crossovers again.",
  "and go for this one.",
  "now this is really good.",
  "because it gets you looking where you're skating.",
  "so i have to look where my cones are.",
  "i've got a look ahead.",
  "this is really really good for stopping.",
  "you looking at your feet as well.",
  "Bye Bye.",
  "so i hope as you've watched this video.",
  "a couple of things have stood out to you.",
  "and you've gone i'm going to try that.",
  "that could do it.",
  "so i really hope you've had that eureka moment.",
  "i'm katie.",
  "you've been watching skatey.",
  "and i'll see you next time.",
  "bye.",
  "Outtakes."
