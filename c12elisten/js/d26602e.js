  "after getting married max and arya seemed to have a happy life together when suddenly max became seriously ill leading to a deep coma [Music].",
  "arya will together find a way to bring max back to his senses.",
  "but first we need to be strong and not lose hope huh [Music].",
  "oh you have finally returned.",
  "please save my max and arya.",
  "thank you queen aurora.",
  "we're here today because of that.",
  "we've known for a long time that max was born from maleficent's magic rose.",
  "therefore all the sources of his strength are related to that flower.",
  "we believe that max's illness is related.",
  "to the rose.",
  "that maleficent is holding in the sealed forest and only the royal.",
  "family can enter the forest and if it is an outsider.",
  "then it would be easy to get lost and perish there.",
  "then i'll go to find max's rose.",
  "we can't rest easy if we'll let you go alone.",
  "believe me i'll go to that forest find maleficent and come back safely.",
  "besides maleficent is max's mother so i believe she won't do any harm to max.",
  "it's just a little misunderstanding here.",
  "i will find out all about this [Music].",
  "i have enchanted a source of power in your crown.",
  "it will create light and a protective shield helping you deal with dangerous creatures in the forest.",
  "here's some food and supplies for you on the go [Laughter] [Music].",
  "huh [Music].",
  "it's maleficent i have to hurry to save her.",
  "huh.",
  "[Music].",
  "why are you here get away from me.",
  "your leg is injured let me bandage it for you.",
  "get out of the way ah.",
  "if you don't let me help surely your wound will become more serious and you won't be able to walk.",
  "do you want to sit here until you freeze to death.",
  "at arya's irrefutable words maleficent had to let arya heal her wounds.",
  "well she seems to be a good person despite being chased away she still wholeheartedly wanted to bandage the womb.",
  "maybe have i been too harsh for her.",
  "no she's aurora's daughter i can't trust so easily.",
  "i've bandaged for you.",
  "however if you still can't walk as easily as usual so please be careful.",
  "well it's none of your business.",
  "but why did you come here.",
  "that's because for several days max was in a deep coma and did not wake up.",
  "the fairy godmother said it had something to do with max's magic rose so today i wanted to find you to talk to.",
  "oh no maybe that spider has read the note in the magic book about maxis rose.",
  "can you tell me more about this.",
  "a few days ago because i was angry about max for not listening to me and not going back to the forest.",
  "i was going to concoct a magic potion named forget to make him forget you.",
  "however to successfully make that potion i must obtain the venom of the rare giant spider.",
  "at that time i secretly followed them and caught a small one [Music].",
  "but before i could extract the venom to make the potion the mother spider not only discovered.",
  "She not only attacked me with spider silk but mother spider also took max's rose and my magic book then left [Music].",
  "i tried to chase for many days but because my leg was injured and too tired i got exhausted and fell here.",
  "but all of that is because i want my son max to come back to me.",
  "unexpectedly it caused max to get into trouble and suffer so much.",
  "i understand that you love max very much and only accidentally caused this.",
  "i myself know that you have a grudge against mother aurora and me.",
  "but now we both want to save max so the only way is to work together to find max's rose.",
  "although i don't like aurora and her daughter arya seems to be useful in the journey to find max's rose.",
  "besides i am injured in the leg not convenient to walk.",
  "i think i can humbly cooperate with her this time.",
  "okay i agree to cooperate with you but don't let that mean you think i've agreed to let you and max be together.",
  "yes i understand.",
  "well that's good but we need to find our way through this thorn bush to get to the mother spider's cave.",
  "i've got an idea [Music].",
  "along the way arya not only did not well on maleficent's previous grudge but always took care of her.",
  "the other side is the lair of the mother spider.",
  "we are about to successfully get the rose back for ah.",
  "watch out.",
  "arya.",
  "i will save you.",
  "mother are you okay.",
  "are you seriously injured anywhere.",
  "this girl is really nice.",
  "even though i didn't like her and used harsh words to talk she saved me twice.",
  "she even got scratched because of saving me but didn't say a word of complaint.",
  "actually max has already married a good person.",
  "i'm fine thank you ah we're almost there.",
  "we have to quickly find a rose.",
  "[Music].",
  "before i remember this place also had many other living creatures but mother spider must have used the power of the rose to increase its capacity and expand the territory here.",
  "arya.",
  "just like maleficent said when they entered the cave they saw the mother spider sucking the power from the robes and growing bigger.",
  "and it was also because the power of the flower was strongly related to max so when the mother spider took that power max fell into a coma.",
  "oh no we have to get the flower back before mother spider has all the power in it.",
  "i will distract mother spider and you take this opportunity to get the flower back.",
  "[Music].",
  "[Music].",
  "mother spider come and fight me.",
  "[Music].",
  "huh yeah.",
  "[Music].",
  "[Applause].",
  "[Music].",
  "arya was caught by mother spider.",
  "i have to save her.",
  "but i also have to quickly bring this flower back to save max's life.",
  "but arya has saved my life many times and she dares to go into this dangerous forest to find a flower to save max.",
  "mother spider i got your rose.",
  "oh.",
  "[Music].",
  "hurry up and get out before mother spider wakes up.",
  "let's get out of here and bring the rose to max.",
  "later with arya's help maleficent came out of the sealed forest and brought the black rose to save max.",
  "put the rose on max the energy of the flower will save max's life.",
  "[Music].",
  "huh.",
  "thank you for saving me.",
  "it was your mother who helped you out of the danger.",
  "arya then recounted maleficent's entire story to max.",
  "i'm sorry that all this time i only thought about revenge and didn't care about everyone's feelings.",
  "during the journey of finding the rose i know how good arya is.",
  "so i agreed to let the two of you belong together i also wanted to start over to be a kind person.",
  "[Music].",
  "oh no mother was bitten by a poisonous spider.",
  "the poison of this spider when bitten on a person cannot be cured.",
  "it can't be we just reunited.",
  "i don't want mother and us to be spotted again.",
  "[Music].",
  "[Music].",
  "we've seen maleficent change over the journey of finding the rose back to save max.",
  "so we hope you can keep your promise to be a kind person.",
  "i promise.",
  "[Music].",
  "after that arya and max took maleficent to the king and queen and told everything.",
  "in the end they lived together happily ever after.",
  "once upon a time in a prosperous kingdom.",
  "when people were happy with their lives.",
  "suddenly the king issued a decree banning dancing to everyone's surprise.",
  "from then on the whole kingdom fell into a state of sadness and silence.",
  "at that time there was a beautiful girl named flora she was a waitress at a restaurant.",
  "but had an undying passion for dancing.",
  "despite the king's ban flora still went to the forest every day to practice her dance moves in secret [Music].",
  "by chance during a hunting trip flora was caught by the prince of the kingdom while she was passionately dancing.",
  "the prince looked at her and he found that he was really interested in this pretty lady.",
  "hi.",
  "oh sir sorry to make you watch all of these.",
  "it's all right you dance very well what's your name.",
  "sir my name is flora.",
  "after that day the prince often came to find flora.",
  "both of them didn't know that they already fell in love with each other.",
  "and had some interesting chit chat.",
  "huh.",
  "since then the relationship between the prince and flora deepened which making Rachel the prince's beyonce being jealous even though the prince told her many times that he did not have feelings for her [Music].",
  "just a waiter but there is to steal the princess from me.",
  "then you will pay the price.",
  "i will make you disappear from this place forever.",
  "so said so done at that night rachel sent her agents to kidnap laura then push the poor girl into the river [Music].",
  "a girl from the countryside dares to fight me.",
  "it's like throw eggs against rocks.",
  "later rachel also had someone write a letter pretending to be flora to inform the prince about her disappearance.",
  "my dear prince being with you is the greatest happiness in my life.",
  "however you should have understood that there is a huge difference between us.",
  "and i am just a commoner not worthy of your love.",
  "wish you always be happy.",
  "on my side.",
  "i decided to go far away.",
  "you don't need to look for me.",
  "thank you for everything.",
  "what's wrong with being a commoner.",
  "why can't i love a commoner.",
  "everything gradually passed the pain gradually eased and the prince had to listen to his father to marry rachel.",
  "about flora fortunately after being pushed into the river by rachel's men she was rescued by a boatman so she was still alive.",
  "thank you very much if it weren't for you i would have died in that river.",
  "don't mention it how can i leave someone in danger.",
  "furthermore you are the benefactor of my family you are the only one who can make my father smile in his final years of life.",
  "it turned out that he was flora's neighbor and his father was able to fulfill his last wish thanks to flora.",
  "for me.",
  "i have only one wish that is to see a dance this kingdom has been silent for too long but with the current situation that seems impossible.",
  "if it's a dance i can dance for you.",
  "really that would be great.",
  "nolan do you know why they banned dancing [Music].",
  "i don't know either but i've heard from my father that the king for bad dancing.",
  "because he was afraid that singing and dancing would reduce our labor productivity.",
  "soon after flora said goodbye to the boatman to return to the palace to find a prince.",
  "when everything was going well suddenly a voice rang out.",
  "stop.",
  "flora.",
  "it's me my dear prince.",
  "it was Rachel who who put me in danger.",
  "please bring justice to me.",
