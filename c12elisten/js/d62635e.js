  "p09 REAL LIFE ENGLISH SERIES.",
  "Hey in today's lesson, I'm going to teach you how to use English vocabulary words in real life situations.",
  "In this series, I show you how to actually apply what you're learning.",
  "Are you ready?.",
  "Well, then I'm teacher.",
  "Tiffani, let's jump right in.",
  "Now the very first word I want to explain to you is this one perk good job again after me Herc.",
  "Excellent last time per.",
  "Great job.",
  "Now, this word perk just means an advantage or something extra, again, an advantage or something extra.",
  "Now, how can you use this in real life?.",
  "Let me tell you this quick story.",
  "So I used to work for next.",
  "I worked for NASA for a while.",
  "And I also worked in different government sectors.",
  "So I enjoyed my different jobs and my different responsibilities, but one perk of working for the government.",
  "Was that I had an unlimited supply of pens and markers available to me now.",
  "I love drawing.",
  "I love nice pens.",
  "I love nice pencils.",
  "So I used to buy a lot of pencils and pens and.",
  "But when I started working for the government, I remember the day my boss took me into the supply room and there were pins everywhere.",
  "Thousands of pins, thousands of markers, highlighters of every color and every shape and size and I wasn't heaven.",
  "And I said, oh, so this is one of the perks of working for the gun.",
  "I could have access to all the stationery I wanted.",
  "So my notebooks for work looked beautiful.",
  "Make sense?.",
  "Right.",
  "So again, what I want you to think about again, using this word?.",
  "Think about your job.",
  "What are some of the perks of your job?.",
  "Think of the advantages.",
  "Maybe your job is very close to your home.",
  "Maybe you also have access to a lot of stationary.",
  "Think of the perks of your job.",
  "What are the advantages that you receive from working at your job?.",
  "Now, let me give you an example sentence.",
  "We're going to look at three.",
  "The first one is.",
  "One of the perks of online shopping is finding the best deals for the item you want to purchase.",
  "Make sense.",
  "Right now, sentence number two, American express blue offers a wide range of perks.",
  "American express is a type of credit card.",
  "It offers a wide range, many different.",
  "Perks.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Now Cindy's number three.",
  "You might think of these cards, like business cards with Hertz, you caught it, right?.",
  "So now you understand the meaning of this word perk again.",
  "Think about your job.",
  "If you're not working right now, maybe your previous job or when you were in school or your college or university, think of some of the perks of your job or your university.",
  "Put them in the comment section, let's all kind of practice together.",
  "Now let's move on to word number two and see how you can use it in real life.",
  "The second word is thrive.",
  "A little tricky.",
  "I know, but your tongue through your teeth for the T H sound after me thrive.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Last time after me thrive.",
  "Great job now thrive just means to grow, develop, or be successful to grow, develop, or be successful.",
  "Now this word can be used in so many different situations, real life situations, one that's actually connected to.",
  "So I have been an English teacher on YouTube for a long time.",
  "And I remember when I first started out, I bought a plant that plant represented my growth as a teacher online and helping students.",
  "However, That plant didn't last because the sun was too hot at one point.",
  "And then there was too much water being given to the plant, to the plant.",
  "Didn't.",
  "And I was a little sad, but I bought another plant.",
  "I bought a snake plant and snake plants are known for their ability to thrive in any condition.",
  "Now, this snake plant is actually right in front of me right now.",
  "I haven't watered it in a while because you're not supposed to water it often.",
  "It thrives very easily.",
  "It thrives in any condition.",
  "Again, it can grow.",
  "In any condition.",
  "So in English we say thrive.",
  "Now you can use this word to talk about many different things.",
  "She's thriving now because she goes to a school that's not too far from her.",
  "Parents' home.",
  "He's thriving right now because he's using his talents.",
  "So thrive can be used in many different real life situations.",
  "I want you to try to use thrive as well.",
  "At least one time.",
  "And you can also put an example in the comment section.",
  "Now here's the first example sentence I want to give you a business cannot thrive without investment.",
  "Uh, business cannot thrive without investments.",
  "Sentence.",
  "Number two, loving relationships thrive in an open and honest environment.",
  "They grow.",
  "They get stronger when the couple, the man and the woman are speaking together to each other and they're open and honest.",
  "Now sentence number three.",
  "These animals rarely thrive in captivity.",
  "They don't grow, they don't develop in the same way they would.",
  "If they were out in the wild.",
  "You see, we can use this word in many different real life situations thrive.",
  "So think about a child and what type of environment would a child thrive and grow and become more intelligent.",
  "Comment section.",
  "Alright, here is word number three.",
  "Word number three is bluff.",
  "Yes.",
  "This one is also a little tricky to pronounce again, blah, blah, blah.",
  "Excellent that Bo Bo be sounding that F sound real quick.",
  "Remember if you want to improve your pronunciation, don't forget to download the English with Tiffani app.",
  "Again, you can have it on your Android or your iPhone.",
  "Whichever phone you have.",
  "This app includes pronunciation lessons and so much more to help you improve your English.",
  "So again, bluff can be a little bit tricky, but all you need is a little bit more practice.",
  "The link is in the description for the English, with Tiffani.",
  "So again, a block.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Now this word just means pretending in a difficult situation or trying to deceive someone as to one's abilities or intentions now, real life situation.",
  "When I turned 27, I was living in South Korea and I've told this story during a story time, before a while.",
  "And we were planning a surprise party for another friend of ours who was actually going to be leaving Korea.",
  "And her birthday was before she was going to leave.",
  "So we were planning a surprise party for her.",
  "Now I was helping with the planning of this party.",
  "So we were going to the venue, the location.",
  "And when I opened the door to the place we were having, the party, people were everywhere and they screamed surprised.",
  "And I said, guys, she's not here yet.",
  "She's not here yet.",
  "They were like, no TIF surprise.",
  "I was like, what do you guys mean?.",
  "You see, my birthday was at the same time as this friend's birthday was, but I thought everyone was bluffing and that they were just trying to trick me.",
  "It was actually for her, but actually the party was.",
  "They really hadn't been bluffing the whole time.",
  "They were tricking me into thinking it was for her when it was actually for me.",
  "Bluffing makes sense.",
  "All right.",
  "So here we go.",
  "Sentence, number one, she says someone else has made her a higher offer, but I think she's bluffing.",
  "I think she's.",
  "Bluffing and lying are very similar.",
  "So you know how to use the word lying.",
  "Now you can use the word bluffing.",
  "Now, next one, here we go.",
  "Everyone could tell that he was bluffing.",
  "He's not telling the truth.",
  "He's bluffing.",
  "You can use this in many different real life situations.",
  "Next he is kind and friendly, but he Bluffs.",
  "He lies a lot again, using this in a real life situation.",
  "So the third word bluff.",
  "Now the fourth word is a little bit longer, but it's very useful.",
  "This word is pro longed again, pro longed.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Last time after me pro long.",
  "Great job.",
  "Now, this just means lasting longer than usual or expected lasting longer than usual or expected.",
  "Now real life situation I told you before several months ago, that one of the best shows you can watch one of the best TV dramas you can watch.",
  "If you want to understand Americans and Americans.",
  "The show is called.",
  "This is us absolutely amazing.",
  "This show shows so much about Americans, again, not just from the black perspective, not just from the white perspective, but literally Americans in general.",
  "You'll see many different cultures in the show.",
  "It's a great show.",
  "So the show, actually it went off last week.",
  "The season, not the season of the show finale was laughing.",
  "But the show really was good.",
  "So every week people would wait for the show to come on, but when COVID hit the pandemic of 2020, it didn't come on.",
  "As often as we would have liked, which was understandable, but there was a period of prolonged period where the show did not come on TV.",
  "I mean, several months.",
  "So everyone was wondering what's happening.",
  "Why is the show coming on T.",
  "There was a pro long break, again, lasting longer than usual or expected.",
  "It went a little long when we compared it to other televisions.",
  "But when it came back on, after the prolonged period of waiting, it was so good, it was worth the wait.",
  "So hopefully you can check it out again.",
  "It's called, this is us now.",
  "That's a real life situation where I was able to use pro longed.",
  "I had to wait for a long period of time for the show to come back on.",
  "Think about something you've had to wait for a long period of time to have.",
  "Citizen number one.",
  "How are you going to explain your pro longed absence?.",
  "We knew you were going to be absent, but you were gone a bit too long, prolonged absence.",
  "Number two, she did not want a pro long discussion too long.",
  "I just want it short and sweet and to the point.",
  "And finally.",
  "She prolonged her exposure to the sun.",
  "She was out in the sun for a long period of time in English.",
  "We say prolong.",
  "So again, think of something that lasts longer than expected.",
  "We say prolonged using it in real life.",
  "Now word number five.",
  "This is a word you've probably heard before.",
  "It's very useful, but it's a little bit tricky to pronounce.",
  "So after me vulnerable.",
  "Good.",
  "I know it's tricky again after me vulnerable.",
  "Good.",
  "That be front teeth, bottom lip.",
  "And then the LA sound last time.",
  "Vulnerable.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Now this word vulnerable just means easily hurt.",
  "Or harmed physically, mentally, or emotionally.",
  "Now, as I think about this word, a real life situation comes to mind.",
  "This actually happened maybe about three months ago.",
  "I was walking into my apartment building.",
  "I had just gotten out of my car and I was walking toward the stairs to get to my apartment when I saw a little bit.",
  "Now the little boy was no more than six years old.",
  "If that may be around six, five or six years old, he was a little boy, but I noticed that he was alone and immediately I stopped.",
  "Why?.",
  "Because children are vulnerable again, easily hurt, easily harmed physically, mentally, or emotionally.",
  "No one was with him.",
  "And I thought it was odd because of his age.",
  "So I looked at him and I said, Hey hun, where's your.",
  "And he burst into tears.",
  "He said, I don't, I don't know where my mom is and he just continued to cry.",
  "And I said, honey, honey, it's okay.",
  "Calm down.",
  "It's all right.",
  "It's okay.",
  "We're going to find your mom.",
  "We're going to get you to your apartment.",
  "And he, he started to calm down and he stopped crying as much.",
  "Why?.",
  "Because he was vulnerable.",
  "No one was with them and he was scared.",
  "Right.",
  "He didn't know where his mom was.",
  "He was okay.",
  "When I started talking to him and calming him down.",
  "But children are vulnerable.",
  "Makes sense.",
  "Right.",
  "A real life situation.",
  "Now everything worked out fine.",
  "A friend came that he knew was like, his uncle came and called his mom and the little boy was safe.",
  "But again, Chu.",
  "Our vulnerable.",
  "So think about someone else, you know, that's vulnerable or a situation that would make you feel vulnerable.",
  "Here's an example, sentence.",
  "Number one, we work mainly with the elderly and other vulnerable groups.",
  "People that can't really protect themselves.",
  "Number two, children are the most vulnerable members of society.",
  "Like the little boy I saw at the front of my apartment.",
  "And sentence number three, she's so vulnerable and practically incapable of doing anything on her own about her problems.",
  "She's.",
  "So again, think about real life situations where you can use this word.",
  "Someone is vulnerable.",
  "Now.",
  "I hope you enjoy this lesson.",
  "I hope you learned a lot and I hope you use these words in real life situations.",
  "Remember, it's important to remember.",
  "Consistent, you have to study every day, apply what you learned.",
  "Again, I've created lessons, daily lessons that will help you remain consistent and learn even more.",
  "So go to daily English, lessons.com.",
  "If you'd like to continue studying with me and students from around the world, I hope you enjoy today's lesson.",
  "I will talk to you next time, but as always remember to speak English.",
  "You still there, you know what time it is?.",
  "It's story time.",
  "I said it's story time.",
  "All right.",
  "Today's story is once again about you all as English learners.",
  "So actually I met one.",
  "And it put a smile on my face.",
  "So one day I went out with my friend and his wife, and I've mentioned this story as well.",
  "We were eating some food at a mall, not too far from where I live and the food was delicious.",
  "Now my friend and I, we used to work together as English teachers in Korea, and we hadn't seen each other in a while and he had gotten married.",
  "So again, we were meeting up after a long period of time and I was meeting his wife for the first time.",
  "Now, this was during the pandemic.",
  "So initially we had our masks on, but we took them off so that we could eat lunch together.",
  "So I was sitting, it was a crowded mall.",
  "There were hundreds of people everywhere.",
  "And I was sitting and I was eating my food, talking to my friend and talking to his wife.",
  "And all of a sudden I heard someone behind me say, teacher, Tiffani.",
  "Now my friend would never call me teacher, Tiffani.",
  "He would just call me TIFF or two.",
  "And again, I heard teacher Tiffani and I turned and saw a man and a woman staring at me with a smile on their face.",
  "But also wondering maybe, maybe not.",
  "And I said, yes, I'm teacher Tiffani.",
  "And all of a sudden, the husband says, I told you, I told you it's her.",
  "It's her.",
  "And I proceeded to talk to them.",
  "I said, yes, it's so nice to meet you.",
  "He said, yeah, I saw you.",
  "And I thought it was you.",
  "We talked for a few moments because he saw that I was eating and she said, honey, let's, let's keep going.",
  "But because of the pandemic, we couldn't really hug, but I was so excited to see one of you all in person live in real life and it really warmed my heart.",
  "And I'll never forget that.",
  "It's happened quite a few times where students have walked up to me and said, are you teacher Tiffani?.",
  "And I love when that happens.",
  "I can't wait to meet you personally in real life.",
  "One day soon, hopefully I'll visit your country and be able to say hi and talk to you.",
  "And you can tell me about your English journey and your life.",
  "We can just get to know each other even more so that really put a smile on my face.",
  "When I saw my student in person in real life.",
  "Again, I hope to see you in real life, have a wonderful day, and I'll talk to you next time."
