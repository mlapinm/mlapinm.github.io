  "Once Upon a Time in the Kingdom there lived a prince.",
  "prince Peerless.",
  "he was loved respected for his kind compassionate just nature.",
  "his father a horrible ruler did not like this.",
  "and he made an excuse of his looks.",
  "who would ever marry this horde son of mine.",
  "how unfortunate to have him.",
  "don't say that.",
  "he's our son.",
  "and he is knowable and able.",
  "he's a disgrace.",
  "your highness there's a princess in a not so far off land.",
  "who might be just right for the prince.",
  "and her father is as rich as powerful as you with no doubt the same trouble.",
  "princess Sunbeam was one of the bravest noblestprincesses there ever was.",
  "but just like Prince Peerless.",
  "she too was born with a horn.",
  "marvelous.",
  "send a note to her father.",
  "tell him that we propose matrimony between our son and their daughter.",
  "no father I do not wish to marry her.",
  "how dare you.",
  "do you think a normal princess would agree to marry you.",
  "it has nothing to do with a horn.",
  "we don't know each.",
  "other and I shall not marry for any cause other than love.",
  "love you know.",
  "what guards lock him up in the tower meant for upstart.",
  "and petulant princes like him.",
  "it has not been used in the past 200 years.",
  "maybe prison will take away all ideas of love.",

  "and locked in a tower.",
  "the guards the servants in the tower Love The Prince.",
  "and they looked after him really well.",
  "the prince would spend long hours in the libraries and galleries of the tower admiring the artwork and the books.",
  "one day he noticed something odd in one of the galleries.",
  "my this image looks just like me without the horn what.",
  "did it just move.",
  "the prince thought his mind was playing tricks on him.",
  "so he rushed out of the gallery into one of the libraries.",
  "bring us back our king and queen Prince Peerless.",
  "and you shall be rewarded.",
  "the prince shut the book in horror.",
  "but he felt drawn back to the gallery with.",
  "the moving images on the window.",
  "he looked at them.",
  "and followed the path they indicated.",
  "who are.",
  "my florimond.",
  "how could the terrible enchanter do this to you.",
  "you appear to be in an enchantment.",
  "how how can I help you.",
  "the prince heard a crack near the wall.",
  "through which he had come in.",
  "and saw a large Eagle Glide inside.",
  "you broke my enchantment.",
  "the prophecy has come true.",
  "thank you.",
  "what can I do for you.",
  "I shall fulfill anything you ask of me.",

  "Prince.",
  "you are indeed Noble and brave.",
  "this horn does not become you.",
  "do not worry about flormond.",
  "it is not for you to rescue him.",
  "for now I release you from your captivity in a pleasant place.",
  "where you.",
  "must await your glorious Destiny.",

  "Here Comes the Bride for my son.",
  "I am sorry your highness.",
  "but I will not marry a man I do not know.",
  "much less love.",
  "if you're going to be as petulant as he.",
  "then maybe a dose of incarceration may not hurt.",
  "the king ordered for the princess to be imprisoned in a different part of the tower.",
  "where the prince had been imprisoned.",
  "like the prince the princess too would spend her time looking at the various Galleries and libraries.",
  "when one day she saw something strange.",
  "this shepherdist looks just like me.",
  "without the horn.",
  "what is she doing.",
  "as the princess looked deeper.",

  "here I believe this belongs to you.",
  "thank you princess.",
  "you've delivered me from the pain of over 200 years.",

  "thank you.",
  "thank you indeed.",
  "I could offer you one of two wishes.",
  "what would you like to be princess wise.",
  "and happy or beautiful and vain.",
  "if I have to choose between the pairs of wisdom and happiness.",
  "and beauty and vanity without a doubt.",
  "I would pick wisdom and happiness for beauty is never lasting.",
  "and vanity means constant misery to ourselves and to others.",
  "I would not have imagined you to pick anything but wisdom and happiness.",
  "and a reward for making the right choice.",
  "May the beauty of your heart reflect on your face.",
