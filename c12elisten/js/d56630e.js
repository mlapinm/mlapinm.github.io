  "what a huge collection right.",
  "yeah.",
  "next we are in birds reptiles and amphibian halls.",
  "ooh birds i love them.",
  "how about reptiles and amphibians.",
  "the way i see it is that they can live in different habitats.",
  "so they seem to be the most powerful and interesting species.",
  "i see but they're also very scary.",
  "hey look.",
  "this said the bird collection gives museum goers a brief glimpse at the dwindling bird species being lost in the name of fashion.",
  "in the past people used to use bird feathers to make hats.",
  "well i don't like the hat industry.",
  "these are my favorite halls the fossil halls.",
  "it now houses the largest collection of fossil mammals and dinosaurs in the world.",
  "is that a t-rex fossil.",
  "that's right this dinosaur skeleton is a must-see when visiting the amnh.",
  "it looks so enormous and fierce jess.",
  "yes it absolutely is.",
  "oh do you know what.",
  "actually there is an appealing story behind this t-rex skeleton.",
  "the fossil was originally arranged so that the dinosaur stood upright.",
  "museum experts later determined that it was more accurate to show the t-rex in his stalking position.",
  "stalking position.",
  "you meant he was following watching or harassing a prey.",
  "that's true dora.",
  "just look at him.",
  "he stands with his head low tail extended.",
  "and one foot slightly raised.",
  "i can sense the sneakiness in his position.",
  "indeed this t-rex is as sneaky and skillful as.",
  "you when you stalk your ex-boyfriend's social media.",
  "hey stop it.",
  "this is the biodiversity and environmental halls.",
  "i can finally watch the free-floating blue whale right.",
  "yes it is one of the biggest attractions of new york city.",
  "however.",
  "we got to go through the forest halls first before heading to the oceanic hall.",
  "where they placed the whale.",
  "welcome everyone to the millstein hall of ocean life.",
  "this hall focuses on marine biology botany and marine conservation.",
  "the hall is most famous for its life-sized female blue whale model.",
  "please enjoy your visit and please feel free to ask any questions.",
  "thank you.",
  "excuse me what keeps the whale afloat.",
  "that's a good question because it is so massive.",
  "i hadn't even considered it.",
  "one of our security guards at the museum said it was powerful magnets.",
  "a popular line of speculation involves either wires or strings so thin.",
  "that they cannot be easily seen.",
  "yeah there are thin wires.",
  "that would be wrong.",
  "we built a system of steel wires.",
  "that kept the mammal stuck to the ceiling.",
  "thanks to that museum visitors can have an authentic deep sea experience.",
  "no wonder.",
  "anyway it's kind of impressive the way that.",
  "lets it look free-floating.",
  "oh i get it now.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PH_Mtl9bYI&list=PLOCvbe7RB9fZMMtLM5IP-1oBVxjYownyc&index=170\">oh i get it now</a>",

  "jess i'm thinking about adopting a puppy.",
  "what do you think.",
  "on the order of local authorities.",
  "oh no no no way.",
  "why is it so.",
  "i thought you had fun with those dogs at the park.",
  "i did dora but it's a different thing.",
  "playing with pets such as dogs or cats is taking candies from a baby it's fun.",
  "jess you should be ashamed of yourself for that action.",
  "oh come on.",
  "that's just a metaphor an example.",
  "wait where was i.",
  "you were talking about playing with pets.",
  "yes let me finish this sentence.",
  "i mean playing with pets is much easier than bringing them home.",
  "i understand that getting a pet is no easy decision.",
  "so let's table this make this a debate about the pros and cons of raising a pet.",
  "if i win we can have a pet all right.",
  "the first drawback to pets in the home is allergies.",
  "rejected.",
  "we're both allergy free to animals aren't we.",
  "you won.",
  "next the biggest disadvantage of getting a pet is an increase in responsibility.",
  "just like a young child pets rely on you for absolutely everything.",
  "most pets such as dogs cats and birds can be trained.",
  "that'll be a relief for pet owners.",
  "don't forget that we have a hectic schedule.",
  "sometimes we even have to go on business trips.",
  "a dog will need you to walk him to the park.",
  "plus our apartment is not so spacious for big pets.",
  "i get what you mean.",
  "a small pet like a hamster or mouse might be a better option.",
  "there you go dora.",
  "all in all we can have a pet if we can take care of it right.",
  "yes we can.",
  "no matter what kind of pet you get i'm sure that we'll experience joy and love.",
  "thank you jess.",
  "hello.",
  "welcome to the pet's loving home.",
  "what can i do for you girls.",
  "we're looking for a pet.",
  "we'll go for adoption.",
  "wait a minute jess.",
  "i thought we've done talking about this at home.",
  "i don't want to sound like a bad person.",
  "however as far as i can see.",
  "raising an adopted pet will demand us a lot of effort and responsibilities.",
  "we take care tame and train every single pet either normal or adopted in pat's loving home so don't worry about it.",
  "see i told you adopt don't shop.",
  "by adopting an animal that's been abandoned.",
  "you were giving a good home to a living thing.",
  "we also open up shelter space for another animal who might desperately need it right.",
  "that's very true.",
  "i'm so proud of you jess.",
  "so what kind of pet do you want to raise.",
  "we're quite busy and also new to getting pets.",
  "so we'd love to adopt some small and easy to raise animals.",

  "please follow me i'm going to show you two around.",
  "in pet's loving home.",
  "we house several kinds of animals.",
  "some of the most common pets that people often raise at home are dogs cats birds.",

  "as slow as a snail.",
  "how about ferrets.",
  "a bit too furry.",
  "rabbits.",
  "oh how cute they are.",
  "but bunnies have lots of babies.",
  "well that's all we have in pet's loving house.",

  "i think captain kiwi is a pretty name for him.",
  "he was from new zealand the kiwi land.",
  "and he also has green feathers like the color of a kiwi.",
  "captain kiwi is definitely just a name for him.",
  "sounds reasonable.",
  "anyways remember to put him in the cage that we bought.",
  "i gotta give mike a call to tell him about our new pet now.",
  "yes i remember it now.",
  "your new parrot will need a cage to call home.",
  "you'll also want to pick out a small padlock for the door.",
  "remember that birds are incredibly smart and crafty creatures.",
  "so if you're not careful your parent may figure out how to escape the cage.",
