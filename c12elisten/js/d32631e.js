  "Our gardener is so rude.",
  "I am never going to talk to him again.",
  "Maybe you should try to be nicer to him, Tofu!.",
  "Perhaps he has no friends and feels lonely.",
  "Yes, he doesn’t talk to anyone.",
  "hence, he has no friends.",
  "Why would anyone talk to someone who doesn’t talk to them?.",
  "That’s not what Heidi did.",
  "Who is Heidi?.",
  "There lived a little girl called Heidi.",
  "She lived with her aunt in the village.",
  "Once it happened that Heidi’s aunt.",
  "had to go to the big city for work.",
  "She would be gone for a long time.",
  "So she decided to leave Heidi with her grandfather.",
  "who lived alone on the mountain.",
  "Heidi’s grandfather, a carpenter named Alm.",
  "wasn’t a friendly person because of some experience in his past.",
  "He didn’t like to talk to anyone.",
  "and that is why he lived all the way up in the mountains.",
  "And now Heidi had to live with him.",
  "Bye-bye, Heidi! Be a good girl!.",
  "Bye Aunty!.",
  "Hello!.",
  "My name is Heidi.",
  "Hmm.",
  "Heidi waited a while hoping that.",
  "her grandfather would talk to her.",
  "When she realized he wasn’t going to.",
  "she decided not to disturb him.",
  "and instead she went out to see the mountainside.",
  "She had never seen such vast lands of green.",
  "She fell in love with her new home immediately.",
  "She lay down next to a bed of daffodils.",
  "under the open sky and smiled to herself.",
  "That’s when she heard the goats with bells around their neck.",
  "Meh…meh….",
  "Oh, hello! Where did you come from?.",
  "I brought them here to feed, like I do everyday.",
  "Where did you come from?.",
  "Hello! My name is Heidi.",
  "I have come here to stay with my grandfather.",
  "Hello Heidi! My name is Peter.",
  "Old Grandpa Alm is your grandfather?.",
  "He often helps us with furniture.",
  "and maintaining the barn.",
  "In turn my grandmother bakes bread for him.",
  "You live here with your grandma is it?.",
  "Can I meet her?.",
  "Yes, come with me.",
  "And so Heidi went with her new friend.",
  "to his house to meet his grandmother.",
  "Peter’s grandmother was very loving.",
  "And although she was blind, she loved to talk and cook.",
  "She was very happy when Peter told her about Heidi.",
  "Oh that’s wonderful!.",
  "Come here dear Heidi and give me a hug!.",
  "Are you hungry?.",
  "Well...",
  "come, I will make you some of my special soup.",
  "Heidi spent the rest of the day at Peter’s house.",
  "and learnt how to make special soup from his grandmother.",
  "Heidi asked her if like Peter, she too could call her ‘Granny’.",
  "and she was delighted when she agreed.",
  "When it was evening.",
  "she said goodbye to them.",
  "and went back to her grandfather’s house.",
  "When she reached there, he was still working in his workshop.",
  "So Heidi went into the house.",
  "Sometime later, Heidi called out to him.",
  "Dinnertime grandfather! Come let’s eat together.",
  "Old Alm looked up in surprise.",
  "No one had made dinner for him in decades.",
  "He closed his workshop for the day.",
  "washed up.",
  "and went to eat.",
  "Heidi had made the lovely soup she had learnt from Granny.",
  "They ate in silence.",
  "And although her grandfather liked the soup very much,.",
  "he didn’t say anything.",
  "When dinner was done and the kitchen had been cleaned up.",
  "they both went out in the yard.",
  "and sat under the stars quietly.",
  "After sometime, Heidi started feeling sleepy.",
  "and so she kissed Alm good night and went to sleep.",
  "Alm had not experienced so much love in many years.",
  "and so he sat there with tears in his eyes for a long time.",
  "Next morning.",
  "by the time Heidi got up.",
  "her grandfather was already in his workshop.",
  "She decided to go and be with him.",
  "Good morning grandfather!.",
  "Hmm.",
  "Heidi knew she wouldn’t get an answer.",
  "so she decided to make herself busy.",
  "She swept the workshop.",
  "filled fresh water in Alm’s jar.",
  "and to his surprise kissed him and went out to feed the hen.",
  "When it was about afternoon.",
  "she served a lunch of mashed potatoes.",
  "which she had learnt to make from her aunt.",
  "Later, she went to Peter’s house.",
  "to spend time with granny.",
  "and returned in the evening to serve dinner.",
  "This went on for many days.",
  "Every morning and night.",
  "she would kiss her grandfather on the cheek and wish him.",
  "She would clean his workshop and fill fresh water in his jar.",
  "All this love and care that Heidi gave him.",
  "changed Alm’s behavior.",
  "He loved having Heidi around and enjoyed it very much.",
  "when Peter and Granny came by to visit her.",
  "One day.",
  "upon Heidi’s insistence.",
  "he even took her to the village.",
  "They bought a pair of shoes for Heidi.",
  "On the way back they bought candy floss.",
  "Throughout the trip, Alm laughed and played with Heidi.",
  "All the villagers were surprised to see this change in the old carpenter.",
  "Two years went by.",
  "and Heidi and Alm were very happy in each other’s company.",
  "Till one day Heidi’s aunt returned.",
  "She wanted to take Heidi with her to the big city.",
  "The man whose office she worked in had a daughter.",
  "Klara, who couldn’t walk.",
  "Klara always needed a wheel chair to go anywhere.",
  "Hence, she had no friends.",
  "Klara’s father wanted Heidi to be Klara’s friend.",
  "Grandfather! Tell her, I do not wish to go.",
  "I want to live here, with you!.",
  "But Alm didn’t say anything.",
  "He knew that Heidi would have a much better life in the big city.",
  "And so Heidi left her grandfather.",
  "Peter, Granny and the mountainside to live in the big city.",
  "She was straightaway taken to the Mansion where Klara lived.",
  "There she met Klara’s father.",
  "He was a very kind and loving gentleman.",
  "who loved Klara very much.",
  "but often had to travel a lot for business.",
  "During these times, he left Klara in the care of her grandmother.",
  "and a rather stern housekeeper.",
  "Hello Heidi. I am Klara’s father.",
  "I wanted to thank you for coming here.",
  "I am sure you will like living here with Klara.",
  "If you ever need anything, please let me know.",
  "Now come, I will take you to Klara’s room.",
  "When they entered Klara’s room.",
  "Heidi saw a beautiful girl, maybe two years elder to Heidi.",
  "sitting on a wheelchair.",
  "She was very pretty but she was frail and seemed sad.",
  "The housekeeper pushed the wheelchair forward towards Heidi.",
  "Klara, this is Heidi.",
  "She will live with us now.",
  "I will see you both in the evening now.",
  "Bye...Bye...",
  "Saying so, he and Heidi’s aunt left to attend their business.",
  "For a while Heidi didn’t know what to say to Klara.",
  "My friend Peter has many goats.",
  "Sometimes I can’t make out.",
  "whether he controls the goats or they control him.",
  "Hearing this Klara also broke into giggles.",
  "And Heidi immediately knew.",
  "that they were going to be very good friends.",
  "She started spending her whole day with Klara.",
  "She would tell her many tales of the mountains.",
  "while Klara would tell her about the different cities.",
  "she had stayed in after her mother had passed away.",
  "While the housekeeper was very stern and always stopped the girls.",
  "from enjoying themselves too much.",
  "Klara’s grandmother was very nice.",
  "She even taught Heidi how to read.",
  "Everybody who met Klara now noted.",
  "how happy she looked.",
  "One day, the girls went out to the market.",
  "As Heidi pushed the wheelchair forward.",
  "she saw a vendor selling daffodils.",
  "She was immediately reminded of home.",
  "her grandfather.",
  "Peter.",
  "and Granny.",
  "When they came back from the market, Klara asked Heidi.",
  "Wasn’t today fun Heidi?.",
  "What do you think of my new bracelet?.",
  "Ya.",
  "Its lovely.",
  "And so it went from that day.",
  "Heidi didn’t want to play or sing with Klara.",
  "and she wouldn’t read with Klara’s grandmother.",
  "she wouldn’t even eat unless was forced to.",
  "She would just keep doing her work quietly.",
  "She missed her home terribly.",
  "and her heart broke every time she looked out of the window.",
  "and saw buildings and towers instead of mountains and sky.",
  "This went on till one day she fell terribly ill.",
  "Klara’s father called the doctor right away.",
  "well.",
  "I am afraid she is homesick.",
  "She misses home.",
  "No medicine or treatment can make her better unless she goes back.",
  "I will immediately make arrangements to send her home.",
  "True to his word, Klara’s father made sure.",
  "that Heidi was back in the mountain.",
  "at her Grandfather’s house in two days.",
  "Just the news of going back home had made Heidi feel better.",
  "and when she reached her grandfather’s home.",
  "she ran to him.",
  "and hugged him.",
  "Even Alm was very happy to have Heidi back!.",
  "I am never going away Grandfather!.",
  "You don’t have to!.",
  "Grandfather, this is Klara.",
  "She is my friend from the city.",
  "She has come to stay with us for a few days.",
  "And that is Klara’s father.",
  "As the two men shook hands.",
  "Peter came over.",
  "The children were very excited to see each other.",
  "You must be Peter.",
  "Heidi has told me all about you.",
  "You must take me to your Granny.",
  "Yes, yes! Come.",
  "I will push your chair.",
  "Granny would love to meet you.",
  "After some time Klara’s father said goodbye to everyone.",
  "He would come back in few weeks to take Klara back to the city.",
  "The children waved him goodbye.",
  "In the next few days, the children had a lot of fun.",
  "Peter and Heidi would take Klara along with them everywhere.",
  "Peter would pluck fresh fruits for them.",
  "and they even showed her how to milk a cow!.",
  "With the good air.",
  "environment of the mountainside, Klara grew stronger.",
  "So much that she even learnt to walk by herself!.",
  "Soon it was time for Klara’s father to come.",
  "and take her away.",
  "When he came, she surprised him by walking up to his carriage!.",
  "Oh my darling! I am so happy!.",
  "As they left, everybody was happy.",
  "There was no sadness in anyone’s heart.",
  "bye...bye...",
  "I will visit you soon.",
  "I will too. Goodbye! Take care!.",
  "So you see Tofu, when you are kind and loving towards someone.",
  "you can change their whole life.",
  "Yes, Tia. Thank you for teaching me this valuable lesson.",
  "Perhaps I will take some chocolates for the gardener."
