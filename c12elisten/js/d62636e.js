  "p10 REAL LIFE ENGLISH SERIES.",
  "Hey, welcome to episode two of our, how to use English words in real life.",
  "Now, in today's episode, I'm going to teach you five English words that you can use in real life to sound more like a native English speaker.",
  "Are you ready?.",
  "Welded I'm teacher.",
  "Tiffani let's jump right in.",
  "Now the very first word is provoke.",
  "Good again after me.",
  "Provoke.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Last time provoke.",
  "Great job.",
  "Now.",
  "I want you to listen to this story and see if you can guess the meaning of the word pro.",
  "A few days ago, I was online and I watched a video.",
  "There was a monkey, a big monkey and a cage, and he was sitting down relaxing.",
  "And then a man walked.",
  "And the man started to provoke the monkey.",
  "He started trying to mess with him and the monkey, all of a sudden got angry.",
  "And the monkey as the man was putting his hand to try to provoke him again, stuck his arm through the cage, through the gate.",
  "And he grabbed the man's shirt.",
  "All of a sudden the man started to panic.",
  "He had been provoking the monkey and now the monkey was.",
  "So, what do you think the word provoke actually means?.",
  "Well, provoke actually means to stimulate or give rise to a reaction or emotion, typically a strong or unwelcome one, just like in the story, the man was provoking the monkey.",
  "You caught it right now, the man was okay, but he was extremely scared, but he had been provoking the monkey.",
  "So you can use it again in real life.",
  "Now here's the first example, sentence, dairy products may provoke allergic reactions in some people provoke or give rise to something that's unwelcome.",
  "For example, I can't eat cheese.",
  "I have a cheese allergy.",
  "So just like this example and then says dairy products may provoke allergic reactions in some people.",
  "Now sentence number two, such a decision may provoke a backlash from their supporters.",
  "Again, such a decision may provoke a backlash from their supporters.",
  "And number three, the article was intended to provoke.",
  "Thought to make people think.",
  "Now, remember typically it's an unwelcome one, but in this situation, provoking thought is a good thing.",
  "So again, in English we say provoke.",
  "Now, I want you to think of a way to use this word at least one time today.",
  "Now word number two is RA.",
  "RA good last time after me RA.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Now again, if you need help with your English pronunciation, don't forget to download my app English with Tiffani.",
  "The link is in the description and it can help you because I have tons of lessons on English pronunciation.",
  "Now this word rave.",
  "Let me tell you a real quick story.",
  "You see several weeks.",
  "I received some messages from family and friends because they know that I love Indian food.",
  "Yes.",
  "Indian food is delicious.",
  "And they said, TIFF, listen, there's this amazing Indian restaurant.",
  "This restaurant is in Virginia.",
  "They have a buffet.",
  "And the food is absolutely amazing.",
  "They were raving about this Indian restaurant.",
  "Now the restaurant's name is Aditi a D I T I.",
  "So since they were raving about the Indian food, I decided to go.",
  "And when I went, I understood why they were raving about the restaurant.",
  "The food was so good.",
  "Now, do you know what the word rave means?.",
  "I think you got it.",
  "The word rave simply means.",
  "Talk wildly to talk wildly or incoherently as if one word delirious or insane.",
  "Now this can be used in a negative or a positive way.",
  "The story that I told you uses it in a positive way.",
  "So for example, when my family and friends were raving about the restaurant, they were saying, TIFF, listen, all we can say is it it's really.",
  "So they were sometimes speaking a little bit.",
  "Incoherently talking wildly because it was so delicious.",
  "The food there we say, rave in English.",
  "So here's an example sentence.",
  "Now I understand why travelers rave about Bali.",
  "B is so beautiful, right?.",
  "Sentence number.",
  "Her performance at Madison square won RA reviews from the critics and sentence number.",
  "The movie received rave reviews on all social media blogs.",
  "Everyone was saying how good it was.",
  "So again, in English we say rave, and now you can use this word in real life.",
  "Now word number three is also very important.",
  "Word.",
  "Number three.",
  "I want you to repeat after me reflect good again after me.",
  "Reflect.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Last time reflect great job.",
  "Now, what does this word reflect mean?.",
  "Let me tell you, you see, uh, several weeks ago I was watching my nieces.",
  "One of my nieces is 12 years old and the other one is five years old.",
  "Now the five year old, she's a cutie.",
  "They're both very cute girls, but the five year.",
  "She has a mind of her own sometimes.",
  "And she doesn't wanna listen.",
  "Sometimes she wants to do what she wants to do.",
  "So one day as I was watching them, I saw her hit her sister and I saw her continue to hit her sister.",
  "And I said, no, no, no, no, no, don't do that.",
  "I need you to stop.",
  "She said, what did I do?.",
  "I said, oh, I need you to go, go to your room, go, go ahead.",
  "And I need you to reflect on what you did and then come back down and tell me what happened.",
  "I need you to think deeply about what just happened.",
  "So go to your room, reflect on what you did, and then come back and tell me what.",
  "You did explain to me why you hit your sister.",
  "I need you to think about it.",
  "Go and reflect in your room.",
  "Now, what do you think the word reflect means?.",
  "yes.",
  "The word reflect means to think deeply or carefully about now.",
  "Of course, she came back downstairs and everything was fine.",
  "This happened actually more than a few weeks ago, a long time ago, but again, it just means to think deeply or carefully.",
  "Now here's an example sentence.",
  "You have to reflect on how to answer his questions before you get home.",
  "I need you to think deeply about his questions and how to answer.",
  "Sentence number two, for those who went the distance, it was time to reflect on their achievements to think about their achievements deeply.",
  "And finally, the start of a new year is a good time to reflect on the many achievements.",
  "Of the past in English we say reflect.",
  "And again, you can use this in real life, just like I did to explain to you what happened with my niece in the story.",
  "Now word number four is also another one.",
  "That's so important.",
  "Word.",
  "Number four may be tricky, but I want you to repeat after me squeamish . I told you it's tricky again.",
  "Squeamish.",
  "Excellent last time.",
  "Squeamish.",
  "Great job.",
  "Now, let me tell you this.",
  "This happened about, mm, five years ago, five years ago, my mom, my dad and I, we decided to take a walk.",
  "This is when I was staying with my parents and I was home from Korea for a little bit.",
  "And we were taking a walk in the neighborhood and my parents just happened to be behind me talking.",
  "And as we were walking, I saw something in front of me.",
  "It actually was a deer and unfortunately the deer had died and I, I saw the deer in front of me, but I wanted to get a closer look.",
  "I was curious.",
  "So I walked close to the deer.",
  "My parents said, Hey, what, what you doing?.",
  "I said, oh, I just wanna see this deer.",
  "They said, okay.",
  "And I heard something in their voice, but I didn't know what it was.",
  "And as I got closer to the deer, I saw maggots everywhere.",
  "I was so shocked.",
  "And ever since that day, I have been squeamish.",
  "Whenever someone mentions maggots or has a picture or a video with maggots because after seeing literally millions or hundreds of thousands of maggots everywhere over the body of that deer, I literally was shocked.",
  "So now I'm squeamish.",
  "I can't really look at any pictures or any videos where there are lots of maggots after that happened.",
  "Now, did you guess what the word squeamish.",
  "I think you got it.",
  "Squeamish means of a person easily made to feel sick, faint or disgusted, especially by unpleasant images, such as the sight of blood.",
  "So for me now it's the sight of maggots because of what happened when I was walking with my parents.",
  "Now here's an example sentence.",
  "She's really squeamish and can't stand the sight of blood again.",
  "She can't stand the sight of blood sentence.",
  "Number two, many amateur chefs are squeamish about adding live shellfish into the boiling water and sentence number.",
  "I was squeamish about seeing the terrible accident on the bridge.",
  "Again, made to feel sick fate or disgusted usually by the side of blood, or it can be other things as well in English we say squeamish, and now you can use this word as well.",
  "Now word number five is another good one.",
  "Word number five is substantial.",
  "Good again after me substantial.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Last time after me substantial.",
  "Great job.",
  "Now, when I was in Korea, this happened probably about, mm, maybe six years ago.",
  "Maybe five or six years ago.",
  "So at that time there was a big hurricane in Puerto Rico.",
  "So maybe it was only about four or five years ago, but anyways, there was a huge, a big hurricane in Puerto Rico.",
  "Now, one of my closest friends, her family is from Puerto Rico.",
  "Actually her and her husband's family.",
  "And at that time, her family experienced a lot of difficulties because of the hurricane.",
  "So our friends and I that were living in Korea at that time as missionary English teachers, we decided to help her out so that she could send money to her family.",
  "And initially we tried to only get together a small amount of money because we were a mission.",
  "But we were able to collect a substantial amount of money and we were able to give the money to her so that she could help her family in Puerto Rico.",
  "It was a very difficult time for Puerto Ricans at that time because the hurricane was so bad.",
  "But we were so happy and we praised God that we were able to collect such a substantial amount to help her family.",
  "Now, what do you think the word substantial actually means?.",
  "All right.",
  "The word substantial literally means of considerate importance.",
  "Size or worth.",
  "So we were able to collect a lot of money.",
  "All right.",
  "Here's the example, sentence.",
  "Best of all, she could save a substantial amount of money for a down payment on her own place.",

  "I have something right here with me on my phone, and I want to share it with you.",
