  "Hi everyone.",
  "Welcome back to English with  Max.",
  "In this video we're going to look at 50 advanced adjectives to describe emotions.",
  "This  time I'm not going to give you an alphabetical list.",
  "We're going to look at groups of synonyms,  for example, synonyms of \"happy\" and synonyms of \"sad\". Before we get started, I have  something very exciting to announce.",
  "I've just released an advanced vocabulary course  on Udemy.",
  "It's technically a vocabulary preparation course for the TOEFL, but it will also be useful  if you're preparing for another English exam like the IELTS or the PTE, or if you'd just  generally like to learn more English words.",
  "If you're watching this video, you're probably  interested in improving your vocabulary, but maybe you feel like you've gotten stuck,  or that your vocabulary is just not improving.",
  "That's very, very common and it mainly  happens because there are lots of words that native speakers know, but that we just don't use  every day.",
  "Those words can be hard for English students to learn because you don't hear or  see them frequently.",
  "Those are the types of words that I've included in this course.",
  "The course has over six hours of videos, quizzes, pdf worksheets, as well as audio files that  you can download so that you can hear the words repeated in various contexts.",
  "For the next few days  it will be available at the very low price of $9.99.",
  "After that I will still offer  discounts, but not quite as big.",
  "This offer will end on the 2nd of December.",
  "Udemy also offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you start the course and you don't  think it's for you, you will receive a 100 percent refund.",
  "If you'd like to take advantage of this price, you  just need to click the link in the description.",
  "You can also click that link if you just  want to see a preview of the course.",
  "And now the adjectives.",
  "As I said, in this video we're going  to look at groups of synonyms.",
  "Learning synonyms of common words can be a great way to expand your  vocabulary, but you do need to be a little careful because synonyms often have slightly different  meanings.",
  "Keep watching and you'll see what I mean.",
  "We're going to start with synonyms of \"happy\". The  first one is \"cheerful\". Cheerful.",
  "This means happy and optimistic.",
  "It can also be used to describe  someone who clearly looks happy and positive.",

  "Nobody would call them rich, but they were very content with what they had.",
  "Next we have \"delighted\". Delighted.",

  "The next words are \"thrilled\" and \"overjoyed\" .Thrilled.",
  "Overjoyed.",
  "I've put these two words together  because you can use them interchangeably.",
  "My feeling is that \"thrilled\" is a bit more  common nowadays, but you can still use \"overjoyed\". These are similar to \"delighted\", but they're a bit  stronger.",
  "They mean extremely pleased.",
  "For example: Ethel was thrilled when her  crush asked her out on a date.",
  "You could also use \"overjoyed\" in that sentence.",
  "We also often use \"thrilled\" sarcastically.",
  "For example: My boss was thrilled  when I told her I was quitting.",
  "Next we have \"ecstatic\" and \"elated\". Ecstatic.",
  "Elated.",
  "Both of these mean extremely happy and excited.",

  "Now let's see some words that mean the opposite.",
  "These are  synonyms of \"sad\". The first one is \"down\". Down.",

  "A cemetery, for example, might be described  as \"gloomy\". The next word is \"miserable\". Miserable.",

  "Finally we have the word \"sombre\". Sombre.",
  "It's spelt a little differently in American  English.",
  "This word is used a little differently to the previous ones because you can't  actually say \"I felt sombre\" or \"I was sombre\". It means sad and serious, but it's used  to describe things.",
  "Usually abstract things, like a mood, an atmosphere or a facial expression.",
  "So you can say: She was in a sombre mood all day.",
