  "I'm sure you have heard the phrase global warming.",
  "Scientists use the phrase for two kinds of warming.",
  "The first one is an increase in air temperature.",
  "The average air temperature on earth is almost one degree higher than in 1960.",
  "This may sound small but it's really very big for such a short time.",
  "Its effects are troubling.",
  "Glaciers which are rivers of ice are disappearing in mountains.",
  "A mountain in africa called kilimanjaro once had a lot of snow on it.",
  "Now almost all the snow is gone.",
  "Warmer air also helps diseases spread farther and there is even worse news.",
  "The increase gets faster year by year.",
  "The average temperature might rise another 4 degrees in the next 50 years.",
  "The other part of global warming is in the oceans.",
  "Sea water temperatures in most parts of the sea have gone up more than one degree since 1960.",
  "This has caused a lot of problems.",
  "Much of the ice around the earth's north pole melts every summer.",
  "Warmer ocean water has helped cause more heavy rain storms in europe.",
  "See animals that a lot of people like such as penguins have more trouble finding enough cool water.",
  "Lots of fish are dying.",
  "Humans cause much of the trouble.",
  "Factories and cars put gas into the air.",
  "This gas traps heat on earth.",
  "Also people cut down forests that could help keep the planet cooler.",
  "A bigger population means more factories more cars and fewer trees.",
  "Trees help keep the planet cooler so the loss of so much forest is a big problem."
