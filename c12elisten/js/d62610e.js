  "Again, showing interest and being curious, the person will feel like, Hey, you're actually interested.",
  "I want to continue this conversation.",
  "The other thing you need to remember related to this do is that showing interest reveals that you care about what the other person is saying.",
  "When you're having a conversation.",
  "Remember, you're not talking to a brick.",
  "You're talking to another individual.",
  "And when you show that you're interested and curious, they will feel like you care about them and about what they're saying, which will enhance the conversation.",
  "The other thing is being curious means that you can ask questions related to what the person is saying.",
  "I tell this to my students all the time conversation, English conversation is like a tennis match.",
  "Back and forth, back and forth.",
  "Respond, ask a question, respond, ask a question, respond, ask a question.",
  "It shows that you're interested and it shows that you're curious.",
  "The other thing is curiosity also results in you forming your own ideas or opinions about the.",
  "So as you're speaking to the individual, ask them questions, let them know that you're interested in what they're talking about.",

  "You don't want to be in the conversation the entire time, just, ah, Mmm.",
  "Oh, you want to also give your opinion.",
  "It's about balancing giving and taking, listening and speaking.",
  "There has to be a balance.",
  "Another thing you must remember again, related to this due is that you have to try to balance the amount of time that both of you listen and.",
  "This will result in a smooth conversation.",
  "You don't want to listen for five minutes and only speak for 30 seconds.",
  "You want there to be a balance.",
  "Both of you are listening, and both of you are also giving your own opinions or ideas.",
  "There needs to be a balance of give and take during the conversation.",
  "Again, we're talking about speaking English like a native English.",
  "Next.",
  "If the person asks you a question, try to think of another question.",
  "You can ask them as well.",
  "You give your answer and then you say, Hey, what about you?.",
  "How do you feel about.dot?.",
  "You always end your response.",
  "End your time by asking the other individual a question you want them to know that you are also curious about what they.",
  "These are skills you must develop in order to have natural and real English conversations.",
  "It's also important for you to pay attention to the person you are talking to.",
  "This is so you can recognize when they want to speak.",
  "People will give you clues by their body language or their facial expressions letting you know, Hey, they like to respond or Hey, they have a thought or idea about this topic.",
  "You have to balance, give and take.",
  "Don't talk too much.",
  "And also don't listen the entire time.",
  "Balance give and take.",
  "So do balance, give and take.",
  "The next thing you must do is have something interesting to say.",
  "You wanna make sure that you can add to the conversation.",
  "So if you say something interesting about the topic you're discuss.",
  "The person listening to, you will probably ask for more details.",
  "So you have to have your thoughts organized about the topic.",
  "When you say something interesting, the person is naturally going to ask you more questions.",
  "Hey, really?.",
  "That's what you think.",
  "What about.dot do they're going to want more details?.",
  "So think of something interesting to say about the topic.",
  "Another thing to remember related to this.",
  "Is the more interesting a conversation is the longer the conversation will be.",
  "Your goal is to speak English like a native English speaker.",
  "Your goal is to have a natural English conversation that flows smoothly.",
  "Well, when you say something interesting, it makes the conversation more interesting and it will go on and on and on.",

  "In order for a conversation to flow.",
  "Well, you must be thinking of what you can add to the conversation.",
  "This goes back to the second, do balancing, give and take.",
  "What can you add to the conversation to make it interesting.",
  "And also remember, remember that in order to be interesting, the information must connect to the listener in some.",
  "You're not just thinking about the topic from your own perspective.",
  "You want to make sure you're thinking about the person you're speaking with as well.",
  "Hey, how does this connect to this individual?.",
  "This is how you really keep the conversation going and keep it flowing like a native English speaker.",
  "So doing these things will help you really master English convers.",
  "Now, even though there are three important things to do, there are also three important things that you must not do.",
  "The first is don't dominate.",
  "You see, the first thing to remember is to never dominate the conversation.",
  "It is important to make sure there is a balance between you and the person you are speaking.",
  "This is so important.",
  "You need to make sure both of you are contributing to the conversation.",
  "So don't dominate here.",
  "Dominating actually shows that you don't care about the other person's opinion.",
  "And when someone is in a conversation with another individual, that really is not making them feel important or making them feel that their important ideas are.",
  "They're not going to want to continue the conversation.",
  "So pay attention.",
  "It's not just about the words and expressions you use.",
  "You must master these techniques.",
  "So don't dominate.",
  "The other thing to remember related to this is people don't want to have conversations with people who dominate the conversation.",
  "It's not fun.",
  "It's not interesting.",
  "So don't dominate the conversation, pay attention to the person you're speaking with and remember.",
  "Dominating the conversation.",
  "It also shows that your listening skills are not good when you just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, and you dominate the conversation.",
  "It actually reveals that your listening skills are not where they need to be, because if your listing skills were good, you'd want to hear what the other person has to say.",
  "So remember, don't dominate when you are having a conversation with.",
  "The next thing to remember is don't talk more than you listen.",
  "The second thing to remember is that listening skills are an important part of effective communication.",
  "In other words, listening attentively will actually help you to master English conversation.",
  "You've probably never heard this before.",
  "Listening can actually help you speak better.",
  "You see, here's the thing listening attentively will help you understand people better when you understand people you'll know how to organize your thoughts to connect to that person.",
  "Which will make the conversations more interesting.",
  "The other thing you have to remember, again, not talking more than you listen, as you listen, you actually improve your English ability because you are taking in new information.",
  "Your brain is processing new information.",
  "Then you're developing your thoughts or ideas in response to what you just heard.",
  "And then you're responding.",
  "This will help you speak English better.",
  "So don't talk more than you listen.",
  "And remember if you listen.",
  "Well, the other person will also want to listen to you.",
  "It's a give and.",
  "When they see, wow, you you're paying attention to me.",
  "I also want to listen to you and they'll let you speak and also express your ideas and the conversation will flow better.",
  "So don't talk more than you listen.",
  "Another don't that you must remember.",
  "Don't I interrupt.",
  "The third thing to remember is to never interrupt.",
  "This is because interrupting someone or suddenly stopping them is rude and can stop a conversation.",
  "You don't want to interrupt individuals.",
  "This is not something you want to do during a conversation.",
  "People don't want to talk to someone who constantly interrupts them, stops them in the middle of their thought or in the middle of them expressing their idea.",
  "Don't interrupt people.",
  "Interrupting someone shows that you are not listening to them.",
  "So you need to be patient again, we're talking about having conversations like a native English speaker, and also it hinders the flow of conversation because it shows that you think your words are more important and that will stop a conversation from moving.",
  "So remember the three dos and the three dots and you'll start mastering English conversation like a native English speaker.",
  "I really hope you enjoy today's lesson.",
  "Don't forget that if you want to join me and so many other individuals and speak English like a native go to English fluency plan.com.",
  "We'll see you there.",
  "And as always remember to speak English.",
  "You still there you know what time it is?.",
  "It's story read time.",
  "A, I said it's story.",
  "Read time.",
  "All right.",
  "So in today's lesson, I explained the dues and don'ts for English conversations.",
  "I want to tell you about something that happened to me that dealt with English conversations.",
  "So this happened, woo.",
  "At least nine years ago, I was in South Korea and I had went to lunch with one of my friends.",
  "She was also a missionary English teacher and we went to this really good Indian restaurant, the food, absolutely amazing.",
  "So we had our food and we were just sitting there talking and eating at the same.",
  "And a topic came up and we started giving our ideas or opinions on the topic.",
  "Now my friend was giving her opinion and then I gave mine.",
  "But after I gave my opinion, I could see that my friend's breathing started to change.",
  "She was breathing harder and I could see that her facial expression was changing as well.",
  "And she started speaking at a faster pace and I could sense that she was a little bit irritated and upset.",
  "Now as I was watching her and listening to her, I started speaking to myself and also praying God what's going on right now.",
  "My friend looks upset.",
  "I'm not sure why she's upset.",
  "And I was listening to what she was saying, but also paying attention to her body language.",
  "Now, remember I said, the important thing you must do is to listen when you are having a conversation.",
  "And during that time, as I was trying to figure out why she was getting upset, God reminded me of a Bible verse that I had.",
  "The Bible verse says a soft answer, turns away wrath.",
  "Basically when you respond softly, when someone is getting upset and you respond calmly, that will help the person calm down as well.",
  "But you have to recognize what's happening.",
  "So my friend was getting a little bit hyped.",
  "She was getting upset and it was my turn to speak.",
  "She stopped.",
  "And now again, it was my turn.",
  "and I responded, I was very calm.",
  "I said, you know, I, I didn't realize that what I said affected you in that way.",
  "And I'm sorry for that.",
  "And I do think that this.dot dot and I continued having the conversation, but my voice stayed here very calm.",
  "And immediately my friend went from here to.",
  "Immediately she calmed down and I realized that communication is not just about the words you use.",
  "It's also about how you speak your tone of voice, your facial expressions, your body language, because I was seeing so much happen as I listened to her words, her body language was telling me so much.",
  "So when you're in a conversation, make sure you listen, attentively, pay attention to the person as they're speaking so that when you respond, your response matches what they said to you.",
  "Either to calm them down, to encourage them, to make them happy.",
  "Your response can have a big effect on the individual you're speaking to or.",
  "So never forget conversation is not just about the words you use.",
  "It's about paying attention to the other person and responding to what they have said.",
  "Now.",
  "I hope the story encouraged you.",
  "If you ever get into a little bit of a disagreement with your friend, remember speak calmly, softly and slowly, and your friend will calm down.",
  "Hope you enjoyed this story.",
  "I'll talk to you in the next lesson."
