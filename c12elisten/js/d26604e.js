  "once upon a time there was an old king who ruled a kingdom.",
  "he had a loyal bodyguard named johann who was by his side all the time.",
  "johan had a special talent he talked to animals.",

  "then one day the old king became very ill.",
  "however johan stayed by his side to take care of him every day and night.",
  "johan felt very sad and worried.",
  "knowing that he could not live for long the old king called johan and told him.",
  "johann my friend i will pass away soon and you are the one i trust the most.",
  "i am worried about prince philip.",
  "he is too young i'm afraid that he's not mature enough to be the new king.",
  "if you don't promise me to help him advise him and teach him i will not be able to rest in peace.",
  "i promise to be loyal to the prince just as i am to you please do not worry even if i must sacrifice my life.",
  "i will never leave the brits alone.",
  "very good now i can go in peace.",
  "at last after i finally die please tell philip about all the wealth and treasure he inherits from me.",
  "however absolutely do not let the prince go to the last room along the corridor.",
  "because there is a photo of princess gemma from manila in that room.",
  "if philip sees the photo he will faint and fall in love with her because she is very beautiful i could not bear that he would go face dangers to find her.",
  "please always remember this.",
  "your majesty i will follow your instructions.",
  "the old king also called prince philip in and talked to him for the last time.",
  "philip you must remember this.",
  "i have asked my most loyal bodyguard johann to help you after i die.",
  "you have to listen to his counsel and advice.",
  "just remember there's always a reason for everything johan does.",
  "dear father i will always remember what you have said.",
  "after the king's death philip became the new king to rule the kingdom.",
  "one day philip walked around the palace with the bodyguard johann.",
  "philip looked at all the property his father left him and became deeply touched.",
  "then he walked to the end of the hall and saw the room which had always been closed.",
  "this room looks so secretive i must go in to see what is inside.",
  "johann remembered the king's advice and immediately stopped prince philip.",
  "but he was too late philip went straight to the secret room.",
  "suddenly philip saw a portrait of a beautiful girl in front of him.",
  "it was princess gemma from manila.",
  "when he saw the photo the young king was immediately in love because of gemma's beauty.",
  "oh no the bad luck that the king warned me about has come to pass.",
  "what should i do now.",
  "mr johann who is this beautiful girl.",
  "your majesty she is prince gemma from manila.",
  "oh i fell in love with her right at the moment i saw this portrait.",
  "now my dream is that i will find her and marry her and if i cannot i can't live anymore mr johann will you please help me.",
  "god your majesty if you really want her i think you have to prepare lots of gold and silver to propose to marry princess gemma.",
  "i will help you with this.",
  "very good mr johann you're such a loyal friend.",
  "then johan and philip took a boat to manila gemma's kingdom.",
  "they brought with them lots of precious jewels and gold in order to propose to marry the princess.",
  "sir johann i just saw her portrait and i lost my soul and became speechless.",
  "now when i see her what if she doesn't like me and won't marry me what do i do.",
  "oh your majesty don't worry first we have to decorate this boat beautifully.",

  "well king philip has proposed to princess gemma.",
  "when they walk to the shore there will be a white horse waiting to pick them up to the palace.",
  "if philip or gemma jump on the horse it will carry one of them and then run away.",
  "the king and the princess will never see each other again.",
  "only if someone jumps on their horse first to ride it away the king and the princess can stay together.",
  "it's my diabolical plan but no one could possibly know that.",
  "if anyone knows and tells the king about this that person will become a stone statue.",
  "when they return to the palace there will be a bright carpet on the floor to welcome them.",
  "yeah if philip and gemma step on it it will turn into a flying carpet and take them away.",
  "there has to be someone who steps on it before the king and the princess then.",
  "the kingdom won't fly up and away and they can live happily ever in the palace.",
  "but no one could possibly know that.",
  "if anyone dares to tell the king this that person will turn into a stone statue.",
  "and that's not everything.",
  "when the king and the princess prepare for the wedding.",
  "someone will bring a beautiful wedding dress there.",
  "if the princess wears it she'll die immediately.",
  "there has to be someone to take that dress and throw it into the fireplace then the curse will disappear and the king will live with the princess forever.",
  "but there's no way anyone could possibly know that.",
  "and even if they did they would turn to a stone statue.",
