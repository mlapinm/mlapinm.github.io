  "i would clean up everything later.",

  "okay got it.",
  "i think you should have more sympathy with your wife.",
  "she just gave birth.",
  "many women also experience postpartum depression.",
  "so it's normal to get angry easily.",
  "besides you're the one who made mistakes anyway.",
  "your reason for everything is that you come home from work being tired.",
  "but it may be even more tying for her to take care of the baby alone all day.",
  "at least you shouldn't add more work for her right.",
  "back to the milk bottle you don't know.",
  "how carefully mothers take care of their babies.",
  "just thinking about the bacteria multiplying in the baby's bottle is driving them crazy.",
  "besides maybe she needed a bottle for her baby right away.",
  "but she didn't have one.",
  "washing and cleaning the bottle also takes time baby can't wait you know.",
  "yeah it seems like i was too careless.",
  "actually i'm not mad at her at all.",
  "i'm just a little tired of hearing complaints all day long.",
  "then you should think about how tired.",
  "she is from the lack of sleep to take care of the baby.",

  "i'm so glad to hear that what is the key to a happy marriage in your opinion.",
  "yeah it works well of course part of being a good couple is knowing when to give each other some space.",
  "that's true.",
  "i see a lot of people who move in together and they give up all the things which make them individuals.",
  "we spend a lot of time together.",
  "but we have our own friends our own hobbies and so on.",
  "sure you mean you don't want to be too dependent on each other.",
  "absolutely although you need to strike a balance.",
  "you need to make time for each other too.",
  "of course i imagine that it can be easy to let things slip when you've been together so long.",
  "yeah it's dangerous actually you can't take things for granted otherwise your relationship will suffer.",
  "one more thing is we have a cute daughter.",
  "i think having a child really strengthens the connection between two people.",
  "of course but you know sometimes conflict happens the most when you're parenting.",
