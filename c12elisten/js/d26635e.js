  "how could this world even exist without me.",
  "if so everything will lose its vitality and everywhere would become bleak and gray.",
  "then i'm the winner.",
  "the argument seemed to be endless everyone had their own reasons.",
  "the seven colors became irritable and their debate became more and more intense.",
  "they separated apart.",
  "each kept a cloud for themselves and then glared barefully at each other.",
  "the son above had witnessed everything.",
  "he was shining brightly then glanced downward.",
  "oh my stupid colors how can i make them understand and change their mindset now.",
  "the son quickly came up with a plan.",
  "he then asked the large grey cloud for help.",
  "he happily agreed slowly soared and obscured the sky.",
  "what what's wrong with the sky.",
  "sun where are you i don't want to play hide and seek like this.",
  "suddenly a lightning flash followed by a loud thundercraft.",
  "the wind blew and water from the great cloud began to fall.",
  "what a heavy rain as it was raining.",

  "i can't stand it i can't be calm of think of anything in this weatherhurry up let's quickly assemble and protect each other.",
  "that's the only way to overcome this fierce storm.",
  "following purple's advice the seven fairy stood side by side and held each other's hands to fight against the storm.",
  "since then the strong winds could no longer blow all seven friends away.",
  "the seven fairies covered each other from the pouring rain until it stopped.",
  "and then so miraculously that a beautiful rainbow appeared in the sky.",
  "from that rainbow strip a sun gradually emerged and shown brightly all over the world.",
  "the seven colors were so amazed because it was the very first time they saw themselves that gorgeous.",
  "hey please tell me what happened is.",
  "is this our appearance when we are together.",
  "oh my god so beautiful we are shining as brightly as the sun.",
  "yet we've never known this.",
  "that is the beauty and your power what a pity when you all kept being jealous of each other and didn't realize that.",
  "each color was created with its own mission and meaning as all of you will make this life much more beautiful stop being selfish instead try to live harmoniously and make this world better together.",
  "the seven fairies found it reasonable.",
  "and they happily agreed with the sun's suggestion.",
  "from now on whenever it rains why don't you create a rainbow together to symbolize your harmony.",
  "the rainbow is also the symbol of hope and reconciliation.",
  "that's how the sun used to rain as a mediator whenever seven colors were in the conflict.",
  "since then after the rain the rainbow with seven beautiful shining colors will appear in the sky.",
  "that's when the seven fairies of red orange yellow green blue indigo and purple reconciled and together created the colors for life."
