  "talk about your favorite season.",
  "rob chris natasha and rose are talking about their favorite.",
  "season and the conversation slowly turned into a discussion.",
  "watch the video to see at the end which season do they all like most.",
  "guys i'm wondering which season is the best season of the year.",
  "in my opinion i like winter the most.",
  "seriously you're from a tropical country natasha.",
  "i thought you can't bear the low temperature in winter here.",
  "well to be fair the reason why i love winter here is that i'm from a tropical country.",
  "in the past i had never seen snow.",
  "never got to wear many layers of clothes and definitely never celebrated christmas.",
  "wait your family never celebrated christmas before.",
  "but you guys do now.",
  "yes it's hard not to with such a joyful and festive atmosphere.",
  "it has become one of the holidays that i look forward to the most.",
  "i have a different point of view.",
  "i prefer autumn.",
  "i love the cool breezy weather.",
  "it gives me a really peaceful vibe.",
  "we all know you get too excited when the season comes.",
  "oh really.",
  "just the thought of sitting beside the window with a cup of tea.",
  "and watching the leaves falling down already warms my heart so much.",
  "i think autumn is quite great too.",
  "not as amazing as winter of course but i love drinking pumpkin latte and halloween is always so fun here.",
  "you're absolutely right pumpkin lattes at starbucks are the best.",
  "but autumn is like a signal that the school year is going to start soon.",
  "so i don't like it i prefer summer.",
  "i have tons of free time to go wherever i want to.",
  "actually we all kind of enjoy summer.",
  "whether we like it or not.",
  "right trips summer fruit the sun shines every day.",
  "even sudden summer rains are beautiful.",
  "i just love everything about it.",
  "but the days when it's too hot.",
  "ugh i can't handle that.",
  "i sweat easily so summer sometimes annoys me.",
  "well every season has their own drawbacks.",
  "but to me the hot weather it's not such a big deal.",
  "i still love it when summer comes.",
  "seems like we all have different opinions about this.",
  "unlike you guys.",
  "i'm a spring person.",
  "wow really i've always thought that you were a winter like me.",
  "no winter is too cold for me.",
  "i hate it when i can't go out just because it's too cold or snowy.",
  "when spring comes the weather gets warmer.",
  "and it's also the time when lots of flowers bloom.",
  "everything in spring is just pretty and lively.",
  "to me spring is kind of a boring season.",
  "i don't really see something specific or unique about it.",
  "i don't think so.",
  "spring is the first season of the year.",
  "which means it's a new beginning.",
  "it motivates me to neglect all the bad things that happened in the.",
  "previous year.",
  "move on and try to be better.",
  "that sounds really inspiring.",
  "yes my brother told me that once.",
  "oh speaking about siblings.",
  "my brother is coming back to america tonight.",
  "really i'm so happy for you he's been gone for so long.",
  "thank you we're going to pick him up at the airport.",
  "so i think i should go home.",
  "it's also a bit late now.",
  "yeah let's all go home.",
  "we will continue this discussion tomorrow.",
  "hello grandma.",
  "good evening rose we have just gone out with your friends.",
  "yes grandma did you have fun.",
  "of course i did.",
  "we went to a cafe shop and we just talked and enjoyed our drinks.",
  "sounds nice what did you talk about.",
  "well we were just discussing our favorite season of the year.",
  "but it was more like deciding on which season is the absolute best season.",
  "oh how cute do you have a favorite season grandma.",
  "me no.",
  "you see when you've reached my age the season is just another name for a time.",
  "life goes on and you live without noticing which season it currently is.",
  "i have more important things that i need to think about.",
  "that's deep i mean the season is just another name for time part.",
  "yes so i don't really have a favorite season.",
  "i also don't think that there's something about a particular season that makes me like it more than the others at least at the moment.",
  "but you must have had one when you were young right.",
  "i think i did i was always excited for summer to come.",
  "wow really my friend chris likes summer too.",
  "so what makes him like this season.",
  "well he said that summer gives him plenty of time to go hang out with friends to travel.",
  "he loves the summer heat and the light from the sun too.",
  "what about you grandma.",
  "what i love about summer is that it's unpredictable.",
  "today might be a breezy and bright day.",
  "but tomorrow it might be rainy and cloudy.",
  "it shows how magical nature can be.",
  "and i used to be in awe of that.",
  "but isn't it that unpredictability annoying sometimes.",
  "i mean what if you're playing with your friends and it suddenly rains.",
  "i was 10 at the time rose i loved showering in the rain.",
  "as a kid getting wet because of the rain or because of the sweats wasn't that big of a deal.",
  "after all you didn't have anyone to stay impressed for.",
  "you may be right.",
  "the reason why you like a season can speak a lot about your personality too you know.",
  "people know how unpredictable the weather and summer is.",
  "but you rarely find someone that likes summer because of that.",
  "but it's my reason and your grandpa used to say that that means i tend to appreciate things that people don't really care much about.",
  "oh now when i think about it it's so true.",
  "good morning guys.",
  "hello.",
  "let's sit down the weather is really nice today.",
  "see summer can have cool days too.",
  "oh you remind me about our conversation yesterday chris.",
  "should we continue.",
  "yes we still haven't decided which season is the best one.",
  "yesterday i told my grandma what we talked about and she said something really interesting.",
  "what is it.",
  "she said that the reason why you like a season.",
  "can speak a lot about your personality.",
  "wow i haven't really thought of that before.",
  "but it seems true i love summer because i can travel everywhere.",
  "and i'm a very active person.",
  "i can't stay in one place for too long.",
  "that's right i thought about it too.",
  "and i like autumn because it gives me a peaceful vibe.",
  "i'm an introvert i prefer quietness and i love being on my own.",
  "it's really a perfect match.",
  "rob loves spring because it's a new beginning.",
  "so i guess that means he's someone who always moves forward and very excited for the future.",
  "oh my god that's so true.",
  "what about me.",
  "you like winter because you can layer clothes.",
  "watching the snowfall and celebrate christmas with your family right.",
  "that's true.",
  "well then i think you're just a person who really enjoys life.",
  "you like sceneries you care about the way you dress.",
  "and you love being with your family a girl with a very put together lifestyle in my opinion.",
  "yeah that seems like me.",
  "even though i've never thought that highly of myself.",
  "but my friends and relatives sometimes said the same thing you did.",
  "you know what i think the best season doesn't exist after all.",
  "i mean it's difficult to find a similar advantage between all seasons.",
  "and even if we can find it i don't think every single person will agree.",
  "i think the same people have different opinions and that's completely fine.",
  "what's really important is that we live life to the fullest.",
  "and try to find the good in every phase of the year.",
  "even in a time we don't really like.",
  "wow that's a very mature thought i can't agree more.",
  "me too.",
