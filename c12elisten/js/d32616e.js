  "Hi, Tia.",
  "Hi, Maria.",
  "Hi, Joanna!.",
  "Hi, Tofu!.",
  "Hello, Tofu!.",
  "Hello, Tofu!.",
  "What are you all up to?.",
  "We are completing our art project for tomorrow.",
  "I also wanna do it.",
  "can I?.",
  "Wait, wait, wait, Tofu!.",
  "why?.",
  "All I want to do is add my prints also.",
  "I",
  "I’ll follow your pattern.",
  "I’m sorry Tofu, but there’s no place on this one.",
  "Can I give you another sheet to do this?.",
  "It’s okay if you don’t want me to be a part of the fun, Tia.",
  "Hey, Tofu.",
  "Oh, now you have time for me?.",
  "Well, actually I had a story for you.",
  "Its about a lost mitten.",
  "On a cold, winter day.",
  "when the entire forest was covered in a white blanket of snow.",
  "a kind mole came upon a warm mitten.",
  "Oh, wow!.",
  "A warm mitten on this cold day!.",
  "I’ll live in it and make it my home for the winters.",
  "Just as the mole was making himself comfortable in his new house.",
  "a little frog showed up at its mouth and called out to the mole.",
  "Hello Mr. Mole.",
  "Oh, hi there frog!.",
  "How can I help you?.",
  "It’s very cold out here today.",
  "My feet are freezing in the snow.",
  "Can I share your mitten with you?.",
  "Of course, there is enough room in here for both of us.",
  "So the kind mole welcomed the frog in the mitten.",
  "Just as they were warming up.",
  "a rabbit comes up to them.",
  "Hello, friends!.",
  "It is really cold out here.",
  "My tail is freezing!.",
  "Please give me some space in the mitten.",
  "Of course, come in, come in!.",
  "The rabbit was very happy for the generosity.",
  "And he got into the mitten with the mole and the frog.",
  "Then they had two more visitors.",
  "A fox and a vixen.",
  "It is so c-c-cold today.",
  "My snout is freezing.",
  "I feel like I am breathing ice.",
  "Can we please get some shelter in the mitten?.",
  "We’re already three in here.",
  "It’ll be a little tight.",
  "but sure, come in.",
  "We will manage some how.",
  "Thankful, the fox and the vixen squeezed themselves into the mitten.",
  "But there was just no space for anyone to move.",
  "Sometimes the rabbit would step on the frog’s foot.",
  "and sometimes the mole stepped on the fox’s tail.",
  "As they all struggled.",
  "a bear came along.",
  "A warm mitten and good company!.",
  "Just what I need on this gloomy cold day.",
  "Make room for me friends.",
  "I’m going to come in too.",
  "Oh, no!.",
  "But there’s no place in here.",
  "You’re too big for this mitten.",
  "I promise, I won’t take too much space.",
  "Oh, no Oh, Noooo!.",
  "but the bear didn't litsen to them.",
  "And made it into the already crowded mitten.",
  "The animals had no choice now.",
  "but to stick their heads out of its mouth.",
  "so that there was space inside for their bodies.",
  "And just as they were all finally settling in.",
  "a baby mouse came along, shivering in the cold.",
  "Hello, everyone!.",
  "You all look so warm in there.",
  "It is so cold here.",
  "Look at my tiny tail.",
  "It has frozen it self blue.",
  "please.",
  "Let me also come in.",
  "Sorry, little mouse.",
  "but this mitten is completely packed.",
  "Even though you are so tiny.",
  "there is just no room for you here.",
  "Oh, but I see some place.",
  "It’s all that I need.",
  "The little mouse dashed towards the mitten.",
  "and before anyone could say anything.",
  "he climbed on to the bear’s nose and sat there.",
  "But his cold little tail hung there and irritated the bear’s nose.",
  "He was about to sneeze!.",
  "Aaaachoooooooooo!.",
  "The bear couldn’t hold his sneeze.",
  "and with a loud sound he sneezed so hard.",
  "that the mitten went flying up, up.",
  "and up in the air.",
  "and all the animals got thrown out of it into the cold snow once again.",
  "hmmmm.",
  "‘Hmmm’, what Tofu?.",
  "‘Hmmm’.",
  "I was going to be the bear in your mitten!.",
  "Yes, and you would have sent it flying into the air!."
