  "as you know more than 50 countries all over the world use english as an official language.",

  "they speak english as their mother tongue or as a second language.",
  "that's the reason why english has become the third most popular official language in the world.",
  "after chinese and spanish.",
  "exactly.",
  "anything you want to add rio.",
  "well speaking english is a way to connect with people.",
  "because people often have certain distances and problems when communicating as they do not speak the same language.",
  "but when they speak english they can understand what the other person wants to say.",
  "even though they are not of the same nationality.",
  "not of the same region or even not the same continent.",
  "that's a great idea.",
  "what do you think jack.",
  "yeah i hold the same opinion.",
  "english really helps when i want to talk with others.",
  "in other words it's a key to communicating effectively.",
  "quite so.",
  "in my country brazil.",
  "there are some people who speak english like me.",

  "while others usually speak portuguese.",
  "i've heard about that from my father.",
  "you know my father is a korean too he only knows one more language is english.",
  "when my father went on a business trip to brazil.",
  "of course he didn't know portuguese.",
  "oh so what happens.",
  "but fortunately he found some people there who speak english so my father can communicate easier.",
  "great.",
  "i don't know you have to face this problem or not.",
  "but when you are traveling it will happen a lot.",
  "oh what's that.",
  "you know if you come to another country.",
  "you will not know the language that people speak.",
  "yeah i agree.",
  "so how can you communicate.",
  "in my country korea which has millions of people from different countries in the world travel every year.",
  "tourists come here and they don't know korean.",

  "um i know.",
  "i traveled to vietnam for my vacation.",
  "and i don't know vietnamese.",
  "so what do you do.",
  "well when i went to ask vietnamese people something.",

  "right.",
  "english is like the common language of people who want to communicate with the whole world.",
  "great.",
  "alice how do you feel about english.",
  "well actually i love its accent because it's quite diverse.",

  "yes that is.",
  "moreover canada accents australian accents a lot.",
  "people said that it's hard to understand all of them.",
  "but i feel how amazing it is and i want to find more about them.",
  "maybe in the future i will have a project about it by conducting a survey like this.",
  "that's a great idea alice.",
  "yes and for this reason everyone can speak english easily equally regardless of country or accent.",
  "as long as they can exchange information with others.",
  "isn't such a language great.",
  "of course it is.",
  "when i was studying in korea.",
  "i knew that english was very necessary to study abroad especially in the us.",

  "well number one is it has to be the employees themselves.",
  "people who run a cafe who are generally amicable people.",
  "really just make me want to come back and to talk to them and.",
  "also the setting of cafes.",
  "i have some of my favorite cafes that usually like to hang local artists.",
  "so they're constantly kind of like not only getting involved with the community.",
  "but also like helping them with their work and helping people in the community.",
  "kind of see what other people in the community are into and doing every day.",
  "also sometimes like cafes that have like music or shows is really really cool to me.",
  "what do you think.",
  "actually i agree with that quite a bit.",
  "i think the atmosphere is very important part of it.",
  "and actually i have another question for you.",
  "when you go back to a cafe do you actually go there for the coffee.",
  "or do you go there for something else.",
  "and you happen to buy a coffee there.",
  "sometimes both i'm a bit of a coffee addict.",
  "so i definitely go for the caffeine boost but i do like to.",
  "you know now and then i'll say oh that cafe looks.",
  "kind of cool.",
  "like you know.",
  "look at what they have hanging inside or at the music that's being played.",
  "and oh look they have lots of board games.",
  "i'd like to sit down.",
  "and you know see who'd maybe want to play with me.",
  "and then end up buying a cup of coffee.",
  "okay i think for me so often it's that i want to sit down somewhere and read a book.",
  "but i want to get out of my house.",
  "i want to get out and go somewhere there are energy and people.",
  "and so i think the atmosphere plays a big role for me because i don't really go there to get a coffee.",
  "as much as i go to do work or read a book or study language or things like that.",
  "that's so true i could never study in a library because it's so quiet that i fall asleep.",
  "if i were to go to a coffee shop.",
  "there's the ability to kind of zone out.",
  "because there's so much going on around you.",
  "people meeting to chat you know the blending machine making a special cafe iced mocha.",
  "but not plenty of table space to where you can go.",
  "and you know just kind of sprawl out with all of your different belongings.",
  "and study or even get lost in a book.",
  "right and i think when i'm reading i want a really comfortable cushy chair.",
  "but i find that actually when i'm studying especially if i'm writing.",
  "i'd rather have maybe a wooden chair and a table that i can work with.",
  "also sometimes too like when i study.",
  "studying is really not that much fun.",
  "so if you're in a cafe you always have the ability of possibly running into somebody who's going to distract you.",
  "exactly just a way to procrastinate and.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp6f2MfYnig&list=PLOCvbe7RB9fZMMtLM5IP-1oBVxjYownyc&index=48\">exactly just a way to procrastinate and</a>",
