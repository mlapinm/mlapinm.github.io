  "okay so what's the problem.",
  "it's a surprise test dia.",

  "well he's advising you from his experience.",
  "let me tell you a story to help you understand.",
  "the musical donkey.",
  "once upon a time a potter had a donkey.",
  "the potter was very poor so he didn't have enough to feed the donkey.",
  "hence the donkey was very thin.",
  "one night the donkey was hungry even after his dinner.",
  "so he wandered in search of food and reached a nearby field and ate the crops.",
  "this went on for a few nights.",
  "till one night he met a jackal.",
  "hello there.",
  "hello.",

  "i love cool juicy cucumbers.",
  "okay come follow me then my friend.",
  "the jackal took the donkey to a nearby field that had cucumbers growing in it.",
  "and they both ate their tummy full.",
  "from that night the donkey and the jackal met every night and enjoyed the delicious cucumbers in the field.",
  "one night after a hearty meal the donkey said he wanted to sing.",
  "i feel like singing tonight.",
  "no no no my friend.",
  "you must not sing.",
  "but the donkey ignored the jackals wise advice.",
  "and started singing.",
  "hearing a donkey prey in the field alerted the farmers.",
  "they came rushing to the field with their sticks.",
  "the wise jackal knew what would happen next.",
  "and jumped over the fence for his safety.",
  "but the donkey kept singing till the farmers found him.",
  "once they did they beat him up and chased him out of there.",
  "so you see tofu.",
  "sometimes a wise advice is not to be ignored.",
  "otherwise you will get chased out of a field or fail a math test.",
  "yes tofu you are right.",
  "i think i owed him an apology and need to start studying.",
  "i agree."
