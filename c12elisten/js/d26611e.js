  "once upon a time there was a beautiful young girl named alva.",
  "who lived with her mother a skillful weaver in a small house in the countryside.",
  "alva's mother wanted her to follow her weaving career.",
  "but alva was only passionate about drawing.",
  "she did not want to learn to weave at all.",
  "her mother found it very annoying because in her opinion painting was just a waste of time.",
  "alva come here and learn how to weave with me.",
  "but mom i have to finish this painting first.",
  "why don't you listen to me how many times do i have to tell you.",
  "painting is just a hobby we are still.",
  "very poor.",
  "if you want to earn money to support our family you must learn how to weave.",
  "but mom painting can also make money.",
  "a beautiful painting cost a lot more than a roll of fabric.",
  "look at the poor artists out there.",
  "do you still want to be like them.",
  "paintings are not a daily necessity like the demand for fabric.",
  "everyone needs clothes to wear every day so it's better to know how to weave rather than painting.",
  "please learn how to weave seriously.",
  "almost every day the mother tried to force alva to learn how to weave with her.",
  "but alva was still keen on her passion for painting.",
  "one day because alva was too stubborn.",
  "the mother got angry and threw all of her brushes and paintings away making alva very sad.",
  "alva was heartbroken because her mother did not understand her.",
  "she sat down in the yard and sobbed.",
  "at that moment there was a golden carriage passing by alva's house.",
  "inside the carriage was the queen of this kingdom.",
  "i heard someone crying around here.",
  "welcome to our humble house your highness.",
  "thanks oh this girl is so beautiful.",
  "is this your daughter.",
  "yes your highness this is alva my daughter.",
  "i just heard her crying.",
  "what's wrong with her.",
  "your highness it's just a small problem in my family.",
  "i am a weaver but my daughter wants to.",
  "oh right my daughter really loves to weave but my family's poor.",
  "so i don't have enough threats for her.",
  "that's why she was sad and cried.",
  "oh mom.",
  "oh what a hard working girl.",
  "i love to hear the weaving sound and it's so great to see all the beautiful bundles of colorful fabrics.",
  "if you want your daughter can come with me to the palace to weave.",
  "i have enough threats for her so she can weave as much as she wants.",
  "it's our great pleasure of course.",
  "i agree thank you so much.",
  "but mom i.",
  "what are you doing come on say thanks to the queen.",
  "thank you your highness.",
  "if she follows the queen to the palace she will have to learn to weave.",
  "alva's mother was so delighted with the idea.",
  "she quickly prepared the luggage for alva to follow the queen to the palace.",
  "don't worry i will be okay.",
  "i can take care of myself.",
  "now you can follow the queen to the palace and remember to listen to her.",
  "soon the carriage took the queen and alva to the beautiful and magnificent palace.",
  "the queen took alva to a large room.",
  "in the room there were a lot of beautiful and high quality threads that were arranged in piles.",
  "you can weave here whenever you want.",
  "being hard working is always the greatest treasure.",
  "yes your highness i promise to try my best.",
  "however looking at the pile of threats in the room alva felt very worried.",
  "she wanted to tell the truth that she didn't know how to weave and did not want to do it.",
  "but she was afraid that she and her mother would be punished for telling lies.",
  "alva was thinking while wandering in the garden.",
  "suddenly she found a white painting frame that someone left there.",
  "she couldn't help it and started painting.",
  "suddenly a young man walked by.",
  "he was prince elmer.",
  "the prince was surprised to see the beautiful painting that the girl was strolling.",
  "who are you why are you painting.",
  "here your majesty i did not know it was your painting.",
  "it's just just because i love painting so much i accidentally.",
  "your painting looks so beautiful i forgive you.",
  "why are you so scared.",
  "but then when the prince looked at the girl in front of him with a beautiful face.",
  "and white skin he felt a bit shy so he did not joke with her anymore.",
  "oh i was just joking who are you and why did you come here.",
  "prince i am a weaver and the queen brought me here.",
  "today is my first day in the palace so i didn't know the way.",
  "oh so shouldn't you be in the weaving room.",
  "but but i don't know how to weave.",
  "it was a misunderstanding that the queen allowed me to come here.",
  "you don't know how to weave but you paint really well.",
  "you must have been learning for a long time.",
  "yes i've been passionate about painting since i was a little girl.",
  "oh coincidentally i also like painting.",
  "from now on we can paint together.",
  "since they both had a passion for painting elva and elmer quickly became close.",
  "they talked to each other every day.",
  "one day alva decided to tell elmer the truth.",
  "that her mother forced her to learn to weave and encourage her to go to the palace.",
  "prince alma promised to keep her secret and try to find a way to explain to the queen.",
  "every day they happily painted together in the beautiful royal garden.",
  "elmer really admired elva's talent so he wanted her to go there more often to teach him.",
  "gradually they became closer and grew to love each other.",
  "because she was too focused on painting alva forgot about the pile of threats in the room.",
  "when the queen came in to check elva's work she was surprised to see everything was still the same.",
  "hey alva you haven't weaved for the past few days why.",
  "yes your highness for the past few days.",
  "i felt very homesick so i was not in the mood for work.",
  "i'm so sorry.",
  "it's okay i understand alright starting tomorrow you should focus on weaving.",
  "three days later i'll be here to check again.",
  "alva was so scared as she didn't know how to hide the fact that she couldn't weave anymore.",
  "she bursted into tears.",
  "suddenly a light flashed and three strange old women appeared in front of alva.",
  "the first woman had rough big hands.",
  "the second woman had really big feet which were so unusual.",
  "the last woman had very thick swollen lips.",
  "hello madames who are you.",
  "we are just three poor women.",
  "and very old too what makes you so sad dear.",
  "alva sadly told the three old women about her situation.",
  "no problem don't worry.",
  "we will help you leave all the threads in this room.",
  "really you can help me oh thank you very much.",
  "what can i do to repay all of you.",
  "you just need to agree.",
  "to invite us to your wedding party and introduce to the guests that we are your aunts.",
  "what do you think will you feel embarrassed to introduce us poor old women.",
  "oh of course not i promise.",
  "how can i be embarrassed about the people who helped me.",
  "the three old weavers felt very delighted because it would be their happiest day ever.",
  "they quickly got to work.",
  "the three old women were actually the most skilled weavers in the kingdom.",
  "so the huge pile of threats in the room.",
  "was not a problem for them.",
  "the three old women worked around the clock.",
  "soon they finished weaving all the threats in the room.",
  "meanwhile alva and prince elmer still met each other in the royal garden every day.",
  "they walked chatted and painted together.",
  "their affection for each other became much stronger.",
  "three days later the queen went back there to check.",
  "all the piles of threads now were replaced by colorful and extremely beautiful pieces of cloth.",
  "oh alva how could you weave that much cloth.",
  "did you work all day and night [Music].",
  "yes your highness.",
  "or should i tell the truth to the queen but what will she think if she knows the truth.",
  "she might punish me and my mom.",
  "my gosh what a hard working girl you surprised me.",
  "these pieces of cloth are truly perfect would you like to marry my son prince alma [Music].",
  "i will get married to prince elma.",
  "as i said your hard-working is worth more than anything.",
  "i will hold a beautiful wedding ceremony for you and prince alma.",
  "your highness on the wedding day besides my mother can i invite my three aunts.",
  "they were the ones who taught me how to weave.",
  "that's fine you can invite anyone you want.",
  "prince elmer was also very happy when he knew the queen wanted to hold a wedding for him and alva.",
  "however elmer and alva still felt very worried because they knew that after the wedding elva still had to weave for the queen.",
  "elmer came up with a plan to help alva.",
  "he asked alva to introduce him to the three old women.",
  "because he would need their help with his plan.",
  "i need all of you to follow my plan please remember that.",
  "we got it don't worry your majesty.",
  "finally the wedding day came the palace was decorated very beautifully.",
  "on the largest banquet table the bride and the groom together cheered happily with their family.",
  "when all the guests had come the three old women walked in wearing beautiful dresses.",
  "everyone was surprised and alva immediately ran out to welcome them [Music].",
  "oh my lovely aunts thank you for coming.",
  "she took all three women to introduce them to the queen.",
  "my dear aunts this is the queen.",
  "oh welcome you are alva's loved ones.",
  "please have a seat.",
  "alva asked them to sit next to her.",
  "the queen and prince elmer came to talk to them.",
  "the prince was very friendly [Music].",
  "dear mams please make yourself at home and eat.",
  "oh i really want to play the piano but i.",
  "what's wrong.",
  "look at my swollen hands that's because of all the years i spent weaving.",
  "oh my gosh unbelievable.",
  "and i wish i could dance now but i can't anymore.",
  "what's the reason.",
  "because i usually use my feet to hold the weaving wheel.",
  "so my feet have been swollen for a long time and very painful.",
  "now i know poor you.",
  "and i cannot sing anymore.",
  "what's wrong with you [Music].",
  "look at my lips they're so thick and swollen now.",
  "because i always have to use my mouth to help me weave.",
  "no.",
  "oh mother i think i will never let alva weave again.",
  "yes i agree with you.",
  "but alva loves weaving.",
  "mom actually she doesn't like weaving but her mother wanted her to become a weaver.",
  "both she and i are passionate about painting.",
  "we love each other also because of our mutual love for painting.",
  "when seeing the beautiful paintings of alva everyone in the room was so surprised and admired her.",
  "oh these are amazing.",
  "maybe i should ask you to paint and decorate this palace for me.",
  "but your highness i have something to tell you.",
  "go ahead dear.",
  "actually i have lied to you all the pieces of cloth were weaved by those kind women.",
  "i really wanted to tell you about it a long time ago but i was afraid you would punish my mother.",
  "your highness it was because i didn't one hour to follow the painting career.",
  "so i lied to you to make owl learn to weave.",
  "it was all my fault.",
  "it's okay please get up.",
  "actually when i saw her paintings in the yard when i met you too i somehow understood the story.",
  "i want you to understand alva and support her.",
  "you see she's really talented.",
  "and the wedding was held because my son and i really love her.",
  "if she heard the truth about those women and took credits of their work only that would make me angry.",
  "thank you for understanding.",
  "i'm so sorry alva.",
  "alva and her mother held each other's hands.",
  "alva was so happy when her mother finally understood her.",
  "alva and prince elmer's wedding was held under the blessing of everyone."
