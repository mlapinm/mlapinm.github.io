  "Hi guys!.",
  "In this video we're going to look at words  to describe everyday objects.",
  "Some of these words are nouns and some are adjectives.",
  "And  because my viewers have different levels, some of them are rather simple and some are  quite advanced.",
  "As usual, if you would like to subscribe to my free advanced English email  lessons, you'll find the link in the description.",
  "In the description you'll also find a link  to my course on common mistakes.",
  "You can receive my special discount for that if you  follow that link.",
  "First we have a couple of cushions.",
  "Remember that there's a difference  between pillow and cushion.",
  "This is a pillow.",
  "It's something that you sleep on.",
  "A cushion is  normally something that's decorative.",
  "Um... They come in all different shapes and sizes.",
  "They can  be much smaller than this or much bigger than this.",
  "And they're not necessarily square.",
  "This is  square-shaped.",
  "This material here looks like suede.",
  "Suede is leather that's not smooth and shiny.",
  "If  something is shiny, it means it reflects the light.",
  "So this isn't real suede.",
  "This is what we call  faux suede.",
  "Yes, that word is pronounced \"fo\". It comes from French.",
  "In English \"faux\" means not  real, or fake.",
  "It's something that's made to look real.",
  "So this is made to look like suede, but  it isn't.",
  "It's faux suede.",
  "The surface is soft, but you can also say that this is soft  because it changes shape easily.",
  "Yes... um... \"soft\" has a few meanings.",
  "Here we  have another cushion.",
  "This is also nice and soft, and you could say that this  material is fluffy.",
  "This is fluffy material.",
  "Frank is also fluffy, but I wouldn't call Frank an object.",
  "Frank is Frank.",
  "And here we have a remote control.",
  "This is  the remote control for my reverse-cycle air conditioner.",
  "A reverse-cycle air conditioner is one  that can cool a room and also heat a room.",
  "So you can use it in summer and winter.",
  "Anyway, this remote  control has various buttons (these are buttons), and a little screen.",
  "It's plastic and it's smooth.",
  "We would say that this is rectangular.",
  "Um... It's not technically a rectangular  prism because this part here is curved.",
  "A rectangular prism, strictly speaking,  is a three-dimensional object with six faces that are rectangles.",
  "This tissue  box is closer to a rectangular prism.",
  "Now this is made of cardboard.",
  "Cardboard  is similar to paper - it's just thicker.",
  "You could also say that this is smooth,  and that it's colourful.",
  "\"Colourful\" means with lots of colours.",
  "Now we have a pen.",
  "This is  just a regular ballpoint pen.",
  "It's called a ballpoint pen because there's a very small ball  in the tip.",
  "The tip is the... the very end of it.",
  "This here is the lid.",
  "Some people would call this  a cap, but I call this a lid.",
  "You can say either.",
  "Um... Now, this is hard.",
  "I mean, it's not soft.",
  "If you  bend it, it will break.",
  "There's a... an example of the conditional.",
  "If you bend it, it will break.",
  "Uh...  what else?.",
  "Oh yes.",
  "This dark bit here, that's the ink.",
  "Ink.",
  "So the ink is the colour that  comes out.",
  "Now this is quite thin.",
  "Um... This marker, on the other hand, is rather thick.",
  "So thin and thick.",
  "Here we have a battery.",
  "Battery.",
  "Yes, in the UK and Australia we often  don't pronounce the E.",
  "We say \"battry\". But you can say \"battery\" or \"baddery\" if you want.",
  "Now, this is a cylinder.",
  "That's the shape of it.",
  "A cylinder is a shape that has a circle on the  bottom and a circle on the top which are the same size.",
  "The adjective of cylinder is cylindrical.",
  "I mean, okay, technically there's this little thing on the top, but, you know, basically it's a  cylinder.",
  "And you can say that it's cylindrical.",
  "Cylindrical.",
  "Uh... What else?.",
  "Uh yeah... I don't actually  know what batteries are made of, but the outside at least is some type of metal.",
  "So you could say  that it's metallic.",
  "\"Metallic\" is the adjective of \"metal\". This here is a diary.",
  "Yes, I still use a  paper diary to write down things like appointments.",
  "Um... You could say that this is rectangular.",
  "It's smooth (it's quite smooth), it's shiny... and it has a little ribbon.",
  "This thing here is a ribbon.",
  "You can use the ribbon as a bookmark in the diary.",
  "Here we have a bowl.",
  "A bowl.",
  "This bowl is made  of china.",
  "China is the material that it's made of.",
  "Uh... This bowl is very smooth and shiny.",
  "Uh...  It's round because it has a... well, because the top is a circle.",
  "And it's also hollow.",
  "That means that you can put things in it.",
  "There's lots of space inside.",
  "I'd  also say that this is fragile, or a bit fragile.",
  "If i dropped it on tiles,  for example, it would probably break.",
  "That's an example of the second conditional.",
  "If  I dropped it on tiles, it would probably break.",
  "And now we've come to the most exciting  part of the video.",
  "This is a champagne glass.",
  "And now that I hold it up to these lights,  I realise that it's not totally clean... but anyway... This is a champagne glass.",
  "These tall  ones which are the most common champagne glasses nowadays are called flutes.",
  "This is a champagne flute.",
  "Um... This is made of glass.",
  "It's hollow and because  it's made of glass, it's also quite fragile.",
  "If I dropped it on tiles, it would probably break.",
  "And now some parts of the glass.",
  "These words also apply to regular wine glasses.",
  "This is the  base.",
  "This long tall part here is called the stem.",
  "This part is the bowl and the very top  part is called the rim.",
  "Rim.",
  "We use the word \"rim\" for top parts of all glasses and bowls  and things like that.",
  "Next we have lip balm.",
  "Lip balm.",
  "Now the container is a cylinder, or  you could say that it's cylindrical.",
  "Cylindrical.",
  "The outside is plastic (well, I think the  whole thing is plastic) and it's hard.",
  "You can call this a stick of lip  balm, but technically \"stick\" refers to what's inside.",
  "The... The substance inside is a  stick of lip balm.",
  "Um... You can call substances a stick if they're shaped a bit like this and  if they're quite firm.",
  "So if they're not liquidy.",
  "Now the container is called a tube.",
  "Lots of medicinal and cosmetic products often come in containers that are called  tubes.",
  "This one has a twist base, so if I twist it, the lip balm comes out.",
  "Um... If that looks a  little bit dirty, it's just because I sometimes put it on when I have lipstick on.",
  "Now we have some  lip gloss.",
  "Lip gloss.",
  "This lip gloss is also in a tube, but this is a soft tube.",
  "The lip balm was  in a hard tube or a rigid tube.",
  "Um... If it's a soft tube, we actually call it a squeeze tube or  a squeezable tube, because if you take the lid off and you squeeze it (if you press on it), the  product comes out.",
  "Ooh, like that... Now we have some mascara.",
  "Mascara.",
  "This is a tube of mascara,  but in reality lots of people would call this a little bottle.",
  "So you could say that this  is a long, thin bottle of mascara.",
  "If you take the lid off, you can see the wand.",
  "This part  here is called the wand, just like a magic wand.",
  "And speaking of bottles, here we  have a little spray bottle.",
  "This is lens cleaner.",
  "You can use this to clean the lenses on your  glasses.",
  "The lenses are these parts here.",
  "One lens, two lenses.",
  "The other part of the glasses or the  other parts all together are called the frame.",
  "Frame.",
  "Now this is um... called a spray bottle  because if you take the lid off and press on it, you spray the liquid.",
  "And finally we have my  laptop case.",
  "As you can see, this is quite old, but it's still fine, so I'm not going to  replace it yet.",
  "As I said, this is a case.",
  "But the word \"case\" is quite general.",
  "It's a  container or a cover that protects something.",
  "This type of laptop case can also be called  a sleeve.",
  "It's quite thin and it's not a bag, so you can call it a sleeve.",
  "This  laptop case has a zip.",
  "This thing here is a zip.",
  "You can also call it a zipper.",
  "Zipper.",
  "That's it for today, guys.",
  "I hope you found this educational.",
  "If you would like to practise using some of these words, or if you'd just like to practise your writing, go down to the comments section and describe an object that you use on a regular basis.",
  "Thanks very much for watching,  guys.",
  "I'll see you next time.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL5WNPp5wgU&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=4\">I'll see you next time.</a>",
  "Hi everyone.",
  "In this video we're going to look  at 50 nouns to describe people's personalities and behaviours.",
  "Now, you might be thinking: don't  adjectives describe things?.",
  "How can a noun describe somebody's personality?.",
  "Well, these are  all nouns that indicate a personality trait or a certain quality that a person might have.",
  "A lot  of these can also be used to describe behaviours.",
  "For example, just because a person  was a coward on a specific occasion, it doesn't necessarily mean that they're a coward  all the time.",
  "It's usually clear from the context if we mean that a person is generally something  or is just behaving that way in that situation.",
  "I've tried to include positive, neutral  and negative ones, but to be honest, most of these are more on the negative side.",
  "There  are lots of positive adjectives, but I think that there are just generally more nouns to describe  people who are a pain in the neck, than there are to describe nice, pleasant people.",
  "(People are stupid.) Remember that if you're generally interested in improving your English vocabulary, you can sign  up for my free advanced English email lessons.",

  "Backseat driver.",
  "A backseat driver is a passenger  in a car who gives unsolicited advice to the driver.",
  "\"Unsolicited\" is another good word.",
  "It means  not asked for.",
  "So the person is giving advice to the driver even though the driver has not asked  for it.",
  "And the person doesn't necessarily need to be in the backseat, but that's the word that we  use in this phrase.",
  "For example: I hate driving long distances with Kate because she can't stop herself  from being a backseat driver.",
  "Next we have bigot.",
  "Bigot.",
  "I know it looks like \"bi-goht\", but we  pronounce it \"bigot\". A bigot is a person who has very strong beliefs (especially on race, religion  or politics) and is intolerant of, or unwilling to listen to, other people's opinions.",
