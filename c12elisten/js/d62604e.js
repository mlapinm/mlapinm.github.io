  "Hey, your goal is to speak English fluently, like a native English speaker.",
  "Right?.",
  "Well, in order for you to speak English fluently, you must first think in English and one of the best methods that will help you think in English like a native English speaker.",
  "Is the five W's method.",
  "Now I talk about the five W's method a lot, but today I am going to break down this method and help you truly understand why the five W's method can literally change your English.",
  "Are you ready?.",
  "Well, then I'm teacher.",
  "Tiffani let's jump right in now.",
  "Let's check out the first part.",
  "The first part of the five W's method is the.",
  "According to this part of the method, thinking about the individual or individuals connected to a topic or situation will help you speak English more fluently.",
  "So let me break it down a little bit more for you.",
  "Here's the first and main point.",
  "It is easy to remember the individuals connected to a topic or situ.",
  "You see, as an English learner, many times, when you think about English fluency, you probably think about words and expressions, the number of words you're able to use.",
  "Right?.",
  "It happens even when I was learning Korean, I thought the same thing.",
  "I need to learn tons and tons of words and expressions.",
  "Now that is.",
  "But when it comes to English fluency or speaking a language fluently, it's really about how you break down the information in your mind.",
  "And the first part is the individuals think about the people that are involved in whatever you're speaking about.",
  "Now.",
  "It doesn't matter what level you are right now.",
  "You can think about the people, think about the person you ate lunch with yesterday, immediately, that person's name, that person's face pops up in your.",
  "So the very first part of this method again, is very simple.",
  "Now, the second point is when you think about the people connected to a topic or a situation, other thoughts will automatically be triggered because of the emotional connection you have to those.",
  "This is true, even if the emotional connection is not strong.",
  "For example, let's say you asked me teacher, Tiffani, can you tell me about your experience in Korea as an English teacher?.",
  "Immediately, many of my students pop into my head there faces, and then that leads to the emotional connection I had with my student and still have with many of my student.",
  "This is what happens when you start with the first part of the five W's method.",
  "Think about the individual immediately.",
  "An emotion comes up, maybe that person made you happy.",
  "Maybe you had a disagreement and suddenly you feel a little bit frustrated.",
  "It's important to first think about the individual or individuals that are involved with the topic you are discussing.",
  "Now the next point.",
  "Visualizing helps you speak with more confidence.",
  "When you visualize the people connected to a topic or a situation, you will feel more confident to speak for a longer period of time.",
  "It's very interesting.",
  "Yesterday.",
  "I actually had a private class with one of my students.",
  "He's a medical doctor and he's currently living in Haiti and we were talking about his.",
  "And all of a sudden he mentioned the children he's able to help.",
  "And I could tell the emotional connection he had with those children.",
  "And he was able to talk even more because suddenly he was thinking about the, who the individuals connected to the topic we were discussing.",
  "So this is the very first thing you must remember.",
  "You need to speak English fluently.",
  "You wanna sound like me?.",
  "Well, the first thing you need to do is think about the, who the individuals involved, the individuals connected to whatever topic you are discussing.",
  "Now part two is also very important.",
  "The second part of the five W's method is the what, according to this part of the method, thinking about what actually happened will help you speak English more fluently.",
  "Now, again, before I break down this part, I want to emphasize.",
  "We are focusing on the five Ws, not the words you're using and not the expressions, but those things will naturally come because now you're feeling more confident to discuss the information connected to the topic, instead of just the words or the grammar points.",
  "Trust me, this will change your English.",
  "So let's go to the breakdown of this part.",
  "Now here's the first thing I want you to.",
  "This puts emphasis on breaking down the details of a topic or situation.",
  "So again, When we're talking about English fluency, we are focusing on how you organize your thoughts and for the what part two you're focusing on what happened in the situation connected to the topic.",
  "For example, if you ask me, Hey teacher, Tiffani, what's your favorite food?.",
  "Well, the first thing I think about would be, ah, my.",
  "Let me explain why, what, when I was growing up, my mom enjoyed cooking Mexican food.",
  "Now I love Indian food and Mexican food, but now I'm starting to think about my mom and what she did.",
  "She made lots of Mexican dishes when I was growing up and I can continue explaining what she did, how she made the food.",
  "It's very easy for me because there's so many memories that I.",
  "So the what again, start talking about the details related to the topic you're discussing.",
  "Now.",
  "Point two is when you think about what happened, you won't stress as much about the vocabulary words.",
  "Instead, you will use the words.",
  "You already have to try to explain what actually happened.",
  "This is so I.",
  "Listen, there are tons and tons of words in the English language.",
  "There are so many words that no one American, no one native English speaker knows all of the words.",
  "However, native English speakers are able to use the words that we do have to express our thoughts and ideas.",
  "So when you, as an English learner, following part two of the five W's method, when you focus on what.",
  "And figure out how to use the vocabulary.",
  "You do have the expressions you do know to describe or give details about a situation.",
  "All of a sudden, you will feel more confident because instead of focusing on a grammar rule or a word or a vocabulary expression, or excuse me, an expression now, your focus is on describing what actually happened.",
  "You're trying to paint a picture and the listener will feel more engaged or be more engaged in what you're.",
  "This is what English fluency is all about describing what's happening.",
  "According to part two of the five W's method.",
  "The third thing is thinking about what happened in a certain situation will help you give the most important details.",
  "In other words, the person listening to you will be able to understand your point of view.",
  "I think you're realizing now the importance of thinking in English and using the five W's method.",
  "We are literally focusing on delivering a message, explaining a situation again, the first thing being.",
  "Who was involved.",
  "The second thing being what happened, you're painting this picture and the listener is listening intently because your English is good and you can do this.",
  "Now.",
  "Part three is also very, very important.",
  "The third part of the five W's method is the, when, according to this part of the method, thinking about when something actually happened will help you speak English more fluent.",
  "Let me explain this a little bit more.",
  "So again, the breakdown explaining when something.",
  "This helps you make a comparison with the past, the present and future of the situation you see, instead of focusing on the vocabulary words, the expressions and the grammar rules, you only have five things to focus on.",
  "And now we're on part three.",
  "The, when, so you've described the situation for part two, the what, and now you're talking about when it happened.",
  "Ah, Last year, it was last year about mm.",
  "Around August.",
  "You see, you're giving this time period, and it's easy for you to remember when something happened because that's not connected to a word you learned or an expression, no stress it's connected to your experience.",
  "And that's how you speak English fluently describing and explaining when something happened.",
  "Now, the second point is by describing when something happens.",
  "It will help you clearly express the time period surrounding a specific situation.",
  "Remember when it comes to English fluency, it's all about your ability to describe a certain situation and to help the listener.",
  "The listener is the most important thing.",
  "Does the listener understand what you are?.",
  "Does the listener understand the time period?.",
  "What happened, who was involved?.",
  "The more the listener understands, the more the listener will feel that you are a fluent English speaker they'll feel that wow, your English is really good because they understand.",
  "They see they're able to see visually in their mind.",
  "What you are talking about.",
  "This is what English fluency is all.",
  "Now the third thing, it also helps you give a clear introduction as you begin giving your opinion or response.",
  "Now with the five W's method, it's okay to say things in a different order.",
  "The order is not important.",
  "However, when you are telling someone when something happened in connection to a.",
  "You're basically introducing something and laying out the playing field.",
  "You're basically setting the stage.",
  "Think about a movie when a movie starts, it lets you know, the time period of whatever is happening.",
  "It's the same thing with the conversation.",
  "When someone asks you a question, they want you to basically tell them a story, keep them engaged.",
  "When did it.",
  "What happened, who was involved?.",
  "You're literally telling a story whenever you're answering a question.",
  "So we have part three again, when explain when something happened now, part four is just as important part four.",
  "The fourth part of the five W's method is the, where.",
  "According to this part of the method, thinking about where a situation actually occurred will help you speak English with confidence.",
  "You're focusing on the location.",
  "You can see that in your mind, right?.",
  "So let's break this down a little bit more to help you understand.",
  "So talking about the, where this will help you.",
  "For a longer period of time, as you visualize the location, think about it.",
  "You even when you were a child, it doesn't matter what country you're from.",
  "Even when you were a child, you can remember sitting down, watching a movie, listening to a story, and just suddenly starting to imagine.",
  "Where the story happened, that doesn't change as we get older, we still just like children want to visualize what to see what's happening in our mind as someone is speaking.",
  "So for you to speak English fluently, part four, explaining where something happened.",
  "Think about this image right here, this video happening in the back.",
  "You can describe where ah, they're on this back road and it looks like they're in this small town.",
  "I can give you more details and you start to visualize the location.",
  "Now what about this point right here?.",
  "When you think about where something happened, other memories will flood in or start to come in and help you give a more fluent English response.",
  "Now we're getting these triggers as you speak about the small town, the back road, suddenly other things will pop into your mind and help you speak a little bit longer, giving the right information.",
  "English fluency is not about speaking for hours and hours.",
  "It's really about giving the key information, but when you follow the five W's method, it will help you give the key information clearly and easily.",
  "So for the fourth part, the where talking about the location and you can give a more fluent response point.",
  "Visualizing helps you speak with more confidence.",
  "So when you visualize where something happened, you will feel more confident to speak for a longer period of time.",
  "Earlier.",
  "I mentioned, you know, my favorite food.",
  "Again, I like Indian food.",
  "I love Indian food, but I also love Mexican food, but there's something else that I enjoy.",
  "I enjoy banana nut.",
  "Now we have four Ws so far who my mom, once again, what, the first time she made banana nut bread.",
  "When I was about three years old, where it was in my kitchen.",
  "Now I can continue talking about what happened, why?.",
  "Because as soon as I answered each of the W's for the five W's.",
  "The four right here, I immediately was taken back in my mind to that situation, leaning against the table, looking at my mom, taking the banana bread, nut bread out of the oven.",
  "I was only three, but I still remember that situation.",
  "So I can speak fluently about that situation because I have visualized it and I know where it happened.",
  "And I can describe the location to you.",
  "That's why this part of the five W's method is.",
  "So I.",
  "Once again, visualizing where something happened will help you feel more confident.",
  "You're just talking about your experience and that's what will give you confidence and help you speak English more fluently.",
  "Now the fifth part of the five W's method is the why.",
  "According to this part of the method, thinking about why you have a certain idea will help you speak English with confidence.",
  "People wanna know why you think the way you do.",
  "So here's the breakdown that I want to give you.",
  "Point number one.",
  "Thinking about the, why will help you support your ideas with more confidence as an English learner?.",
  "Your goal is to speak English like a native English speaker.",
  "Well, one thing that I am able to do because of practice, I learned this in high school, I am able to support everything I say, supporting my ideas, explaining why I think the way I do.",
  "I've told you many times before I love.",
  "Absolutely love being your English teacher.",
  "I am passionate about helping you achieve your English goals, and I can give you the reason why first I'm a Christian and my life.",
  "Literally the purpose of my life is to help other people experience more in their lives to help you have a better life to help you be happy.",
  "And.",
  "So as a Christian, I am excited to serve other people.",
  "And I can give you more reasons.",
  "Again, I'm giving you the why for my idea or my opinion.",
  "This is a major part of speaking English fluently.",
  "Now, point number two.",
  "When you think about why you believe a certain way, you will be able to clarify your idea.",
  "Now, again, English fluency is all about the way you think.",
  "And when you're able to organize your thoughts, you're able to then speak English with clarity.",
  "People will be able to understand you and it'll be easy just like you're watching this lesson.",
  "And I think you're following along, right.",
  "It's easy to understand what I'm saying.",
  "I'm breaking down this difficult idea of speaking English fluently into this simple five W's.",
  "Speaking with clarity giving the reason will help it clarify this, clarifies your ideas and help the listener understand point number three, the more you understand why you think the way you do the easier it will be for you to speak English with confidence.",
  "When you organized your thoughts, just like I organized this lesson before I started recording it.",
  "Well, because I organized the lesson before I have confidence to teach it to you.",
  "I'm excited to pass on this information to you because I already organized it in my mind.",
  "I have it ready.",
  "I'm ready to present it to you, but if I hadn't organized it in my mind and figured out why I wanted to teach it to you, I wouldn't have the confidence to teach you.",
  "I'd feel a little bit disheveled, a little bit frustrated.",
  "Ah, what am I gonna teach?.",
  "But when you organize in your mind what you're going to say, and the reason for your ideas, suddenly confidence, that's what happens.",
  "And that's how you speak English fluently.",
  "Now I hope you enjoyed this lesson again.",
  "The five W's method will help you speak English fluently.",

  "It's story time.",
  "Ache.",
  "I said his story time.",
  "all right.",
  "Now I wanna tell you this story today and it's something that happened maybe about a year and a half ago.",
  "So just to give you an idea, uh, a little bit more about me as an individual.",
  "So I am a very frugal.",
  "Person frugal.",
  "It just means I spend money wisely.",
  "I don't spend lots of money on things.",
  "I save money.",
  "Well, and I use money when I need to.",
  "Now I don't mind spending money on other people, but normally for myself, I'll save and I'll invest my money.",
  "So my friend, it was her birthday.",
  "She was turning 50 and she was doing this huge party and the theme was an all white party.",
  "So we had to get an all white outfit for her.",
  "Again, I don't mind it's for my friends, so yes, girl let's do it.",
  "So at the time though, I didn't have anything in my closet.",
  "I didn't have any clothes to wear, uh, to her party.",
  "So I said, okay, let me go shopping now.",
  "I don't go shopping a lot.",
  "Normally I do it once or twice a year and I get a lot and then I'm done.",
  "So I went to a few stores and I finally went to this store that I really like.",
  "So I walked in this store and I found.",
  "An outfit that I liked.",
  "So I went to the dressing room and I tried it on, it looked good on me.",
  "I said, okay, okay.",
  "You know how, when you try some clothes on and you look in the mirror and even if no one's around, you say, well, wait a minute, wait a minute.",
  "I look good.",
  "so I really liked the outfit, but then I looked at the price tag.",
  "I said, whoa, whoa.",
  "The shirt by itself.",
  "Again, remember I'm very frugal.",
  "I don't mind spending money on other people, but on myself, I kind of, you know, I'll get what I need to get.",
  "And then I'm done now.",
  "I like quality.",
  ". So I looked at the price tag.",
  "The shirt was more than $50 right now.",
  "Maybe you have a lot of money and you're spending a lot more on shirts, right?.",
  "Again, I'm very frugal.",
  "So I don't like to spend lots of money on certain things.",
  "Now, the shirt was a very simple shirt.",
  "I could see if it was a dress or something.",
  "It was a very simple shirt, but it was over $50.",
  "So I said, now, wait a minute.",
  "Remember I liked the way the shirt looked on.",
  "but I looked at the price tag and I said, okay, I could use this money for something else.",
  "I could.",
  "I was calculating in my mind how I could use the money for a better use.",
  "But then I thought about my friend and I looked at my time and I said, okay, I don't have time to go to another store.",
  "Her party is tomorrow.",
  "And I know she wants us to wear all white.",
  "I said, you know what, let me just splurge.",
  "Now I had the money.",
  "It wasn't that I didn't have the money.",
  "I just didn't necessarily wanna spend it on the shirt.",
  "So anyways, I went to the front and I went to the cashier and I purchased the outfit.",
  "I purchased the shirt and also the pants.",
  "And again, it looked very nice on me now, again, this was about a year and a half ago and I thought to myself, well, at least I'll wear the shirt one time and I'll be happy.",
  "My friend will be happy.",
  "I have nice pictures.",
  "And.",
  "Fast forward a year and a half.",
  "That one shirt that I bought that at the time, it was a little expensive, has become my favorite shirt.",
  "I wear it all the time again.",
  "Remember I said, it looked good on me when I looked in the mirror.",
  "So what's the lesson, you know, sometimes it's okay to splurge.",
  "Splurge means to do something you don't normally do to spend a little bit of extra money on your.",
  "And fast forwarding to now thinking about how much I like that shirt.",
  "And if I hadn't purchased it, then I wouldn't experience the joy.",
  "Every time I put the shirt on, I feel good about myself.",
  "I feel confident when I wear the shirt.",
  "So I want to encourage you.",
  "It's okay.",
  "Sometimes it's okay to splurge, do something for yourself.",
  "If it may be a little bit extra money, it's.",
  "Every once in a while, splurge spend a little extra money on yourself.",
