  "Hi guys, welcome back to English with Max.",
  "Today I have something a little different for you.",
  "Something that's hopefully a bit of fun.",
  "Today we are going to learn vocabulary related to these things: playing cards.",
  "So if you want to go to a casino, maybe to play some blackjack.",
  "Or if you want to maybe play some poker online, or do other similar things that normally aren't very good for your bank account, this video might help you.",
  "Yes, Max is here to help you gamble.",
  "No, in all seriousness, guys, now I'm being serious, this is vocabulary that you probably won't learn in a classroom, but it's vocabulary that you will hear in English-speaking countries, or in movies and TV shows.",
  "And of course there are a lot more games you can play with these than just poker and blackjack.",
  "So if you're interested in reaching an advanced level in English, this is quite important vocabulary.",
  "And stay till the end because at the end there will be a quiz.",
  "Not a written one, but a spoken one.",
  "How exciting!.",
  "As usual, this is my social media.",
  "I've been doing quite a lot on Instagram lately - I never thought that would happen - but anyway, go check it out, and remember to hit the red subscribe button and the little bell to never miss a video.",
  "Now some of you might have noticed at the beginning of the video that I called these playing cards.",
  "I didn't just say \"cards\". By the way, in American pronunciation you pronounce the R, so it's something like \"cards\". But in the UK and Australia we don't pronounce the R, and it's pronounced \"cards\". \"Cards.\" Most of the time when we talk about these, we just say \"cards\". The problem is, the word \"card\" has lots of meanings.",
  "For example, you might give somebody a birthday card.",
  "Or in soccer (or football) if you do something a bit naughty, you might receive a red card.",
  "Normally it's clear from context which cards we are talking about, but if you want to be specific you can call these \"playing cards\". One playing card, two playing cards, etc.",
  "If you play a game with playing cards, we use the expression: \"to play cards\". And that could mean any game that you play with these cards.",
  "It's a generic term.",
  "For example, I could say to Frank, \"Frank, do you want to play cards later?\" And he could answer: \"Ah no, because I don't have any fingers.\" Fair enough.",
  "A set of playing cards is called a deck.",
  "Deck.",
  "Or you could say: \"a deck of cards\". Here are some example sentences with \"deck\". A standard deck has 52 cards.",
  "Normally you need one deck of cards to play a card game.",
  "However, to play Canasta you need two decks.",
  "Now normally before you play a card game, you need to mix them.",
  "(Piece of hair.) But yeah, when we're playing cards, we don't usually say \"mix\". We actually use the verb \"to shuffle\". So I am now shuffling the cards.",
  "I actually used to be pretty good at this.",
  "I sort of had this trick that I would do.",
  "Let's see if I can still do it.",
  "Bugger.",
  "Okay, maybe I need a table.",
  "Told you I could do it!.",
  "After we've shuffled the cards, normally we deal the cards.",
  "\"To deal\" means to distribute, but we don't normally say \"distribute\" when we play cards.",
  "We usually say \"to deal\". \"To deal the cards.\" When you play cards with other people, normally you take turns in dealing.",
  "That means that if I'm playing cards with Frank and George, Frank might deal the first time, then George will deal, then I will deal.",
  "That's taking turns.",
  "Now if I want to tell Frank that this time he is supposed to deal, I would say to him: \"Frank, it is your turn to deal.\" I could also say to him: \"Frank, it is your deal.\" Because \"deal\" can also be a noun.",
  "Now let's look at the types of cards in a deck.",
  "The first thing you need to know is that there are four suits.",
  "We don't say \"colours\". I know that in French the word for suit in this context is just \"colour\" (couleur), but in English we can say that there are two colours (red and black), but there are four different suits.",
  "And by the way, \"suit\" is spelled and pronounced the same way as this type of suit.",
  "The four suits are: hearts.",
  "Hearts.",
  "Diamonds.",
  "Diamonds.",
  "Clubs.",
  "Clubs.",
  "And spades.",
  "Spades.",
  "There are thirteen of each suit, and each card within a suit has its own rank or value.",
  "Okay?.",
  "So this is a king.",
  "K for King.",
  "This is a queen.",
  "Q for queen.",
  "And this is a jack.",
  "J for jack.",
  "These are called \"face cards\" (these three) because they have a person on them.",
  "This is an ace.",
  "Ace.",
  "All the other cards are just called the number that is on the card.",
  "So that is a seven, that is a nine, that is a three and that is a ten.",
  "Very easy.",
  "Most decks of cards also come with two jokers.",
  "This is a joker.",
  "Joker.",
  "Yes, just like the villain in Batman: the Joker.",
  "To talk about specific cards we need to use the word \"of\". For example: this is the ace of hearts.",
  "This is the ten of spades.",
  "This is the jack of diamonds.",
  "This is the three of clubs.",
  "And this is the king of hearts.",
  "Just a small pronunciation point.",
  "When we say \"of\" between two words, we don't always pronounce it \"of\". We often say \"ehv\" or \"ah\". And that's particularly when we're speaking quickly.",
  "For example, we could say: This is the queen \"ehv\" spades.",
  "The queen \"ehv\" spades.",
  "Or you could say: the queen \"ah\" spades.",
  "The queen \"ah\" spades.",
  "This is the nine \"ehv\" diamonds.",
  "The nine \"ehv\" diamonds.",
  "Or: the nine \"ah\" diamonds.",
  "The nine \"ah\" diamonds.",
  "Okay, now we're going to play a little game.",
  "Very exciting!.",
  "This is just a little quiz to help you practise saying the names of different cards.",
  "So I will show you a card, and then you will say the name of the card.",
  "Then I will give you the correct answer.",
  "So if I show you this card, you will say: \"The six of diamonds.\" Then I will say: \"The six of diamonds.\" Very good!.",
  "Okay, are you ready?.",
  "Now don't just say these in your head.",
  "If you want to practise your speaking and pronunciation, you need to say these out loud.",
  "Okay?.",
  "Let's get started.",
  "The two of clubs.",
  "The two of clubs.",
  "The jack of diamonds.",
  "The jack of diamonds.",
  "The six of hearts.",
  "The six of hearts.",
  "The joker.",
  "The joker.",
  "Did you remember that one?.",
  "Yes, this is a joker.",
  "Five of spades.",
  "The five of spades.",
  "The queen of hearts.",
  "The queen of hearts.",
  "The eight of diamonds.",
  "The eight of diamonds.",
  "The king of clubs.",
  "The king of clubs.",
  "Last one.",
  "The ace of spades.",
  "The ace of spades.",
  "I hope you've enjoyed this lesson.",
  "If you have, please hit the thumbs up, and please let me know in the comments if you like playing card games, or if card games are popular in your country.",
  "Thanks very much for watching, guys.",
  "I'll see you next time.",
  "Bye bye.",
  "Bye bye.",
  "Um... but like... I can't get George on my hand.",
  "And George might deal first, then Geor- There's hammering going on.",
  "Always when I film...",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXCoH39WZW0&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=27\">Always when I film...</a>",
  "Hi guys, welcome back to English with Max.",
  "In this video we are going to look at three meanings of the word \"pretty\". There are actually several meanings of this word, but I don't want to confuse you, so today we are just going to look at the three most important ones.",
  "As usual, remember that you can follow me on social media.",
  "I'm doing a lot on Instagram at the moment.",
  "And also remember that I make English subtitles for all my videos, so if you want to watch this video with subtitles, you need to turn on captions.",
  "Also remember to hit the red subscribe button, as well as the little bell, if you don't want to miss any videos.",
  "Just a small point on pronunciation.",
  "In British English normally you pronounce the T like a normal T: pretty, pretty.",
  "In American English often the T is more like a D: pretty, pretty.",
  "In Australian English - I'm Australian - we mix it up a bit.",
  "Sometimes we say \"ˈprɪt.i\", sometimes we say \"/ˈprɪt̬.i/\". Okay, the first meaning of \"pretty\" is the one that you probably already know.",
  "\"Pretty\" can be an adjective meaning attractive or pleasing.",
  "It's particularly for things that are delicate or graceful.",
  "It can be used to describe people, landscapes, houses, gardens, clothes and many other things.",
  "When it comes to people, most of the time it's used for females, so for girls or women.",
  "But it can also be used for males, particularly before the word \"boy\". A \"pretty boy\". And a pretty boy isn't necessarily a child.",
  "It can also be used for young men.",
  "Members of boy bands like Westlife, the Backstreet Boys, One Direction, etc.",
  "are often described as \"pretty boys\". I'm not criticising.",
  "Most people would probably say that I have quite terrible taste in music, so I actually like bands like that.",
  "I'm just telling you to give you an idea.",
  "Although I don't actually listen to One Direction.",
  "I'm from a slightly older generation.",
  "\"Pretty\" is usually used to describe something visually, in other words, something you can see.",
  "But sometimes it is used for smells or sounds.",
  "For example, you could say: That is a pretty song.",
  "Or: That is a pretty perfume.",
  "\"Pretty\" is similar to \"beautiful\", but it's usually not quite as strong as \"beautiful\". \"Pretty\" can also be an adverb meaning \"quite\". It's basically a more informal way of saying \"quite\" or \"to some degree\", but like I said, it's informal.",
  "It's colloquial, so don't write it in academic essays.",
  "For example: I was pretty tired after my exercise class.",
  "The party was pretty good.",
  "Don't lie to me, Frank.",
  "I know you pretty well now.",
  "The sequel to the film Twilight wasn't horrible, but it was pretty bad.",
  "The third main meaning is when it's used in the idiom \"pretty much\". \"Pretty much\" is a colloquial way of saying \"mostly\" or \"almost\". Here are some examples.",
  "I've pretty much finished my homework, so I'll be able to watch Game of Thrones soon.",
  "That means I've mostly finished my homework.",
  "It's almost done.",
  "Frank spent a long time doing his hair, but it's pretty much the same as before.",
  "I was at the beach for pretty much the whole day.",
  "\"Pretty much\" can also be used alone to answer certain questions.",
  "Then it means: \"Yes, that's basically the case\". Or: \"Yes, almost.\" For example: Frank, have you finished your homework?.",
  "Pretty much.",
  "Are you telling me you spent the whole weekend watching The Bachelor?.",
  "Pretty much.",
  "I hope you found that useful.",
  "If you did, please hit the thumbs up.",
  "If you would like to practise using \"pretty\" in different ways, write me some examples in the comments and I will try and correct them for you.",
  "See you next time.",
  "Ahhee...ah no.",
  "... give an i... give... Like... Adjec... spat a bit.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtrrODgZpHg&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=26\">... give an i... give... Like... Adjec... spat a bit.</a>",
  "Hi guys, welcome back to English with Max.",
  "In this video I'm going to explain the different meanings of the word \"guy\". A few months ago one of my viewers wrote to me and asked me why I normally start my videos by saying: \"Hi guys.\" Well, today I'm going to explain why.",
  "As usual remember that you can also follow me on social media if you want.",
  "I have Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.",
  "Remember as well that there are always English subtitles for my videos.",
  "I don't mean the auto-generated ones.",
  "Those are okay, but they often have mistakes and there's no punctuation.",
  "But I always create proper subtitles for my videos.",
  "You need to click the CC button or the button that looks like a credit card if you're watching this on a computer, and if you're watching this on a mobile device, you need to click the three dots in the corner, and then click \"captions\". While we're on the topic of subtitles, I'd also like to thank all those people who have contributed subtitles in their own language.",
  "I really do appreciate it.",
  "And remember to also hit the red subscribe button - it's free - if you don't want to miss a video.",
  "Okay, the first thing you need to know about the word \"guy\" is that it's informal.",
  "It's not slang and it's not vulgar in any way, but it's informal.",
  "It's colloquial, so don't use it in formal speeches or academic writing.",
  "Let's look at the first meaning of \"guy\". When \"guy\" is used in the singular, so without an S, it simply means \"man\". So \"He's a nice guy\" just means \"He's a nice man\". It can also be used for male teenagers.",
  "For example, a 15-year-old might say: \"Yes, I know John.",
  "That guy's in my class.\" We just don't use it for children.",
  "At least not young children.",
  "We can also use the word in the plural, in other words \"guys\", to address a group of people.",
  "The group might just be women, it might just be men, or it could be a mixed group.",
  "For example, at the beginning of my videos I usually say: \"Hi guys.\" Now that's because I have no idea who could be watching my videos.",
  "It could be men, it could be women, or it could be mixed.",
  "And well, from my statistics (my analytics) I know that it's a mixed group, but even if it was only women, I could still say: \"Hi guys.\" So if I'm spending time with my female friends, maybe we're just at home relaxing, chilling, chillaxing... (I really hate that word.) But anyway, I could say to them: \"Guys, do you want to watch a movie?\" I should also add that if you're not directly addressing people, so if you're not saying: \"Hi guys,\" or \"Guys, do you want to do this?\" But if you're using it in the third person, then normally \"guys\" refers to a group of men.",
  "I know it's a little bit confusing.",
  "For example: When I came out of the restaurant, there were a few guys standing in the car park.",
  "In that instance we would probably assume that the person meant: there were a few men standing in the car park.",
  "Sometimes when it's used in the third person it can refer to women, but that's normally when we know exactly who the person is talking about.",
  "For example, again I'm at home with my female friends, and then we decide to go somewhere.",
  "And so we're talking about cars and transport and things like that.",
  "In that instance I might say: \"Your car is full already.",
  "I'll go with these guys.\" In that instance we know exactly who we're talking about, and we know that I'm talking about my female friends.",
  "Finally, \"Guy\" with a capital letter is a male first name, just like John or Michael.",
  "It was originally a French name and in French it's pronounced \"Guee\", but in English we pronounce it \"Guy\". It's not a very common name, but it's not unusual either.",
  "Thanks very much for watching, guys (I said it again). If you found this helpful, please hit the thumbs up, and remember that if you want to practise your English, you can leave me a comment down below.",
  "Maybe you could try to use the word \"guy\" in different contexts.",
  "See you next time.",
  "Bugger, bugger, bugger.",
  "(cough) Tickle in the throat.",
  "Bugger.",
  "Guy... No, wrong way round.",
  "Oopsies.",
  "For example... There are...",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCIGdfvPjW0&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=25\">For example... There are...</a>",
  "Hi guys, welcome back to English with Max.",
  "Today I just have a short video for you.",
  "We're going to look at the meanings and pronunciations of these two very similar words.",
  "Just so you know, the pronunciations of these words are the same in both British and American pronunciation.",
  "Obviously they'll sound a little bit different depending on whether a British person or an American person is saying them, because people have different accents, but they're not very different.",
  "First let's look at this word: breath.",
  "Breath.",
  "There is a voiceless TH at the end.",
  "Th, th.",
  "Breath.",
  "Breath.",
  "This is a noun and it means the air that goes in and out of our lungs.",
  "The lungs are these two or- (no, not the- not these) ... the two organs here that allow us to breathe.",
  "Here are some example sentences: Frank your breath stinks.",
  "Remember we don't eat garlic like we eat apples.",
  "When I jumped into the water I held my breath.",
  "That means I went like this.",
  "The second word is breathe.",
  "Breathe.",
  "This has the voiced TH at the end.",
  "The, the.",
  "Breathe.",
  "Breathe.",
  "\"Breathe\" is a verb and it means to move air in and out of the lungs.",
  "Like this.",
  "That's breathing.",
  "Some examples: When you do yoga, it's important to breathe slowly.",
  "It smelt so bad in Frank's room that I didn't even want to breathe.",
  "That's it guys.",
  "As usual, if you liked the video, please hit the thumbs up.",
  "And if you want to practise your English, go down to the comments section and use these words in a couple of sentences.",
  "See you next time.",
  "... move air in... No.",
  "As u... taps are going...",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f73kQZbKivg&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=24\">As u... taps are going...</a>",
  "My cat's making noises.",
  "Monty, please stop.",
  "Hi guys, welcome back to English with Max.",
  "In this video we're going to look at various questions that might be useful when you're talking with people in English, particularly native speakers.",
  "These are mainly things that you can say if you have difficulties understanding or hearing the other person.",
  "This video is aimed at intermediate students, but it might also be good for you if you have an advanced level, because I've often heard advanced students make mistakes with these sentences.",
  "If you think you might forget these questions, then I recommend that you get a notebook and write them down.",
  "If you would like to watch this video with English subtitles, you just need to turn on the captions.",
  "Remember to subscribe and to hit the little bell if you want to be updated on new videos, and don't forget that you can also follow me on social media.",
  "I regularly upload short videos to Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.",
  "The first question is something you can say if you didn't hear or understand what the person said.",
  "It's: \"Could you please repeat that?\" Or: \"Could you repeat that, please?\" With this construction you can either put the \"please\" after the \"could you\" or at the end of the sentence.",
  "You can also replace \"could\" with \"can\", so it would be: \"Can you please repeat that?\" But \"could\" is just a little more polite.",
  "You can also use the construction: \"Would you mind...\" Then it would be: \"Would you mind repeating that, please?\" But I think it's just easier and shorter to say: \"Could you please repeat that?\" Now be careful with this.",
  "You cannot say: \"Could you please repeat?\" That's incorrect.",
  "You need to put something after the \"repeat\". So you have to say: \"Could you please repeat that?\" Or: \"Could you please repeat what you said?\" To make this question more polite, you can first say: \"I'm sorry.\" Or just: \"Sorry.\" Either one is fine.",
  "For example: \"I'm sorry, could you please repeat that?\" And you can add \"I'm sorry\" or \"sorry\" to any of the questions in this video.",
  "In English, particularly in British English we like to apologise a lot, so it's not strange to say \"sorry\" quite often.",
  "Another thing you can say if you didn't hear or understand what the person said is: \"Sorry, what was that?\" It's a little bit direct, so it's maybe not quite as polite, but if you say it with a pleasant or polite tone of voice, it's normally fine.",
  "These next two sentences aren't actually questions, but if you say them, it's implied that you would like the person to repeat what they said.",
  "These are: \"I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.\" And: \"I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.\" Both of these mean the same thing.",
  "\"I didn't catch that\" is just more colloquial.",
  "If the person is speaking too quickly for you, the question you should ask is: \"Could you please speak more slowly?\" Or: \"Could you speak more slowly, please?\" If you want to modify it, you can also say: \"Could you please speak a bit more slowly?\" If somebody uses a word or an expression that you don't understand, you can say: \"What does that mean?\" Or: \"What does X mean?\" For example: \"What does spatula mean?\" This is a spatula.",
  "Be careful, because lots of people get this wrong.",
  "You cannot say: \"What means X?\" Or: \"What means spatula?\" You have to say: \"What does spatula mean?\" Another useful question is: \"What do you mean by X?\" We use this is when we understand a word or a phrase, but we still don't know exactly what the person means.",
  "We use it especially if something has several meanings or if something might mean different things to different people.",
  "For example: \"What do you mean by 'she's rich'? Does she own one house or 10?\" Or: \"What do you mean by 'clean'? Do you mean it's like a hospital or do you mean he cleans his house once a week?\" In French it's a bit like saying: \"Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire par là?\" And in Spanish it's something like: \"Qué quieres decir con eso?\" If the person you're speaking to understands your native language, and you want to know the translation of a word or a phrase in English, you can say: \"How do you say X in English?\" Let's pretend you're a Spanish speaker.",
  "You could say: \"How do you say 'caballo' in English?\" If you don't speak Spanish, \"caballo\" means \"horse\". And be careful here as well, because you cannot say: \"How is X in English?\" \"How is 'caballo' in English?\" No.",
  "But you can say: \"What is 'caballo' in English?\" That's fine too.",
  "Sometimes you might want to know how to spell something in English.",
  "Then you could say: \"How do you spell that?\" Or: \"Could you spell that for me, please?\" Or: \"Could you please spell that?\" And if you're still confused, you can say: \"Could you please write that down for me?\" You don't have to use the \"down\" here.",
  "You can just say: \"Could you please write that for me?\" But it's more common to say: \"Could you please write that down for me?\" I hope you found that useful.",
  "If you have any questions, please write them in the comments section down below, and if you liked the video, please give it a thumbs up.",
  "See you next time.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-MbR9EKw8Q&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=22\">See you next time.</a>",
  "Hi guys, welcome back to English with Max.",
  "In this video we're going to look at five very common English expressions.",
  "These expressions are universal.",
  "They're not typically American or typically British.",
  "They are used in all English-speaking countries.",
  "These aren't slang expressions, but we use them in spoken language and informal writing, so don't write them in your academic essays.",
  "If you'd like to watch this video with subtitles, remember to turn on the captions.",
  "Don't forget that you can also follow me on social media and remember to subscribe and to click the little bell if you want to be updated on new videos.",
  "If you haven't yet signed up for my course on common mistakes, you can click the link in the description.",
  "That link will take you to the main page where you can watch some previews.",
  "And by clicking on that link you'll also be able to get the course at a discounted price.",
  "Okay, the first expression is: fair enough.",
  "Fair enough.",
  "We say this when we think something is reasonable or to show that we understand something, whether or not we actually agree with it.",
  "Normally we say it in response to something someone has said.",
  "For example: I'll cook dinner and you can wash up.",
  "Fair enough.",
  "In this case person B is agreeing, so they're basically saying: Sure, that's fine.",
  "Another example... Person A says: I'm going to stop dating that girl because she never returns my phone calls.",
  "Person B says: Fair enough.",
  "In that case, person B isn't really agreeing or disagreeing.",
  "They are just saying: That's reasonable.",
  "I understand.",
  "Here's another example.",
  "Person A: I think we should fire Frank.",
  "Person B: If you don't like him, fair enough, but you can't say that he's bad at his job.",
  "In that case, person B is basically saying: I understand why you think that, but I don't think we should fire him.",
  "In other words, I understand, but I disagree.",
  "And finally... I won't be able to finish the report by Friday because I've had a cold.",
  "Fair enough, but you had the same excuse last week.",
  "In that case, person B is saying: Well, I kind of understand you, but it sounds like you're just making excuses.",
  "The next expression is: it's up to you.",
  "It's up to you.",
  "In French this is similar to: comme tu veux.",
  "And in Spanish it's a bit like: como quieras.",
  "This simply means, it's your decision, or you decide.",
  "For example: Do you want to eat in or eat out this evening?.",
  "It's up to you.",
  "In other words, I don't care.",
  "You decide.",
  "Which movie do you want to see later?.",
  "It's up to you.",
  "When we're speaking, we often leave off the \"it's\". So we just say: up to you.",
  "Up to you.",
  "You can also replace \"you\" with other nouns or pronouns.",
  "For example: It's not my decision.",
  "It's up to them.",
  "Will you get a promotion?.",
  "I don't know.",
  "It's up to my boss.",
  "In those last examples, we wouldn't leave off \"it's\". We only leave off \"it's\" if \"you\" is in the sentence.",
  "So you can say: \"It's up to you\" or \"up to you\". The next phrase is: I don't mind.",
  "\"I don't mind\" is a slightly more polite way of saying \"I don't care\". \"I don't care\" isn't necessarily rude.",
  "If you use a pleasant tone of voice when you say it, normally it's fine.",
  "For example: What do you want for lunch?.",
  "Oh, I don't care.",
  "But you need to be careful with it, because sometimes it's used to express annoyance or indifference.",
  "For example, someone might say: Fine!.",
  "I don't care.",
  "Anyway, \"I don't mind\" is very polite.",
  "You might have noticed that I didn't really pronounce the T.",
  "I didn't say: I don'T mind.",
  "When we speak, we normally swallow it, so we say: I don't mind.",
  "I don't mind.",
  "You can often use it instead of \"up to you\". For example: Do you want to eat in or eat out this evening?.",
  "I don't mind.",
  "Which movie do you want to see?.",
  "I don't mind.",
  "But there are some instances where those expressions aren't interchangeable.",
  "For example: Can I share a table with you?.",
  "Sure, I don't mind.",
  "In that case, we wouldn't say: Sure, it's up to you.",
  "Another example: Do you mind giving me a lift home later?.",
  "No, I don't mind.",
  "Again, in that case we wouldn't say: No, it's up to you.",
  "Now guys, if you're a French or a Spanish speaker, be careful.",
  "Instead of saying \"I don't mind\" or \"it's up to you\", a lot of French and Spanish speakers will say: As you want.",
  "Or: As you like.",
  "While that's not grammatically incorrect, native speakers wouldn't say it.",
  "You will sometimes hear native speakers say: As you wish.",
  "I think that phrase was made popular by The Princess Bride - a great movie - but we don't really use it instead of \"I don't mind\" or \"it's up to you\". We normally use it in response to a command or request, but it's quite formal and old-fashioned so I don't recommend that you use it.",
  "This expression is: it rings a bell.",
  "It rings a bell.",
  "In French, it's like: ça me dit quelque chose.",
  "And in Spanish the translation would be: me suena.",
  "We say this when something sounds familiar to us, but we don't know or can't remember much information.",
  "Have you heard of the movie The Princess Bride?.",
  "It rings a bell, but I don't know what it's about.",
  "You can also say \"THAT rings a bell\". That rings a bell, but I don't know what it's about.",
  "We also often say: the name or his or her name rings a bell.",
  "For example: Have you heard of this movie?.",
  "The name rings a bell.",
  "Do you know George Foster?.",
  "I've never met him, but his name rings a bell.",
  "You can also use it in a question.",
  "For example: Does that name ring a bell?.",
  "The final expression is: Here you go.",
  "Here you go.",
  "When we speak, the \"you\" becomes a \"ye\". Here ye go.",
  "Here ye go.",
  "This is a very simple expression, but I decided to include it, because when you think about it, it's a bit strange.",
  "Here you go?.",
  "You go where?.",
  "It actually has nothing to do with going anywhere.",
  "It's just a common thing that we say when we give something to someone, particularly something that they're expecting.",
  "Let's see some examples.",
  "Can you pass me the salt, please?.",
  "Here you go.",
  "I just collected the mail and there are some letters for you.",
  "Here you go.",
  "We also sometimes use it in emails.",
  "For example, if someone asks you to send them a document, you could send them an email with the document attached and just write: Here you go.",
  "But remember that it's colloquial, so we would only do that with someone who we knew relatively well.",
  "A very similar expression is: Here you are.",
  "It means the same thing.",
  "So you can use \"here you are\" and \"here you go\" interchangeably.",
  "if you'd like to practise using any of these expressions, write a few sentences in the comments and I'll try to correct them for you.",
  "See you next time.",
  "Um I think that... ... Bride... Remember that you need to... ... be... For example... Kookaburras outside."
