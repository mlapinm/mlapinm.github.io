  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MRpFzL5LbQ&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=14\">Hi everyone, in this video we're going to look at some very common English proverbs.</a>",
  "Hi everyone, in this video we're going to look at some very common English proverbs.",
  "A proverb is a short statement that gives advice or expresses a belief that many people think is true.",
  "Most expressions that are considered proverbs have existed for quite a long time.",
  "Before we start, remember that you can also follow me on social media, and if you're interested in signing up for my free advanced English email lessons, you'll find the link in the description.",
  "The first one is: Beggars can't be choosers.",
  "A beggar is a poor person who asks people for money or food, normally in the street.",
  "\"Chooser\" isn't actually a very common word, but I think the meaning is quite obvious.",
  "It's simply a person who chooses something.",
  "People say this if they recognise that they need to accept something, because it is the only option available to them.",
  "It's when somebody isn't in a position to be fussy.",
  "For example, if somebody is really desperate for a job, they might say: The job isn't very well paid, but I accepted it because beggars can't be choosers.",
  "Another example: This isn't my dream car, but it's all I can afford, and beggars can't be choosers.",
  "The second one is: The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.",
  "This is sometimes shortened to: The grass is always greener on the other side.",
  "And most of the time we shorten it even more and we just say: The grass is always greener.",
  "This means that a different situation might seem better than the one you're currently in, but it probably isn't better.",
  "And here's a visual representation.",
  "This cow seems to think that the grass on the other side of the barbed wire fence is better than the grass on its side.",
  "For example, you might say: I wish I had Mary's job.",
  "She's always travelling so much.",
  "And then someone could say to you: Yes, but her job's probably quite stressful and she may wish she had a job similar to yours.",
  "The grass is always greener The next one is: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
  "Here \"ain't\" means \"is not\". Another thing to be aware of is that \"broke\" in this sentence is grammatically incorrect.",
  "It should be \"broken\", but in this proverb we always say \"broke\". So this sentence means: If it isn't broken, don't fix it.",
  "This means that if something is working well, there is no need to change it.",
  "For example, in a workplace someone could say: Why is the new manager changing everything?.",
  "The old systems worked just fine.",
  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
  "I don't know about you, but I sometimes have this feeling with computer programs or websites when they make unnecessary updates.",
  "Like Skype, for example.",
  "They keep changing things and it's annoying.",
  "And now we have: A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.",
  "This apparently comes from a Chinese proverb.",
  "I think the meaning is quite obvious.",
  "It means that even big, overwhelming tasks have a starting point.",
  "It's often used to encourage people who are afraid of starting something because it's overwhelming.",
  "It's a bit like saying: You need to start somewhere.",
  "Or: Just start by doing something small.",
  "For example, if somebody wants to learn a language and they're scared to start, you could say: Well, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.",
  "You could start by watching YouTube videos for beginners, or looking for a teacher, or learning some basic grammar.",
  "I think you get the idea.",
  "This one is: People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.",
  "You can also say: People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.",
  "This basically means don't be a hypocrite.",
  "In other words, you shouldn't criticise people for having faults that you have or for doing things that you do.",
  "Sometimes we shorten this and we just say something like: Well, people in glass houses.",
  "Or we might say: You know what they say about people in glass houses.",
  "For example, if Frank says that Ethel was drinking too much at the party, I could say to him: Well, Frank, you know what they say about people in glass houses.",
  "The next one is: Practice make perfect.",
  "I think the meaning of this is pretty obvious.",
  "It simply means the more you practise something, the better you will get.",
  "It doesn't mean you'll learn to do something 100% perfectly.",
  "For example, nobody, not even native speakers, speak a language perfectly because everybody makes mistakes sometimes, but generally speaking, if you practise something, you will become better at it.",
  "If Frank is complaining because he keeps falling off his skateboard, I could say: Well, Frank, practice makes perfect.",
  "Or if George says that he finds it hard to ignore marketing people in the street, I could say: Well, George, practice makes perfect.",
  "George is a bit too polite sometimes.",
  "And now we have: Time is money.",
  "This means that time is a valuable resource, so we shouldn't waste it.",
  "People usually say it if they want somebody to hurry up, particularly in a business context.",
  "For example, if you're at work and you're mucking around with your colleagues, your boss might come by and say: Come on, guys.",
  "Time is money.",
  "This one is: Two heads are better than one.",
  "This means that two people working together to solve a problem will be more effective than one person working alone.",
  "For example, if you're looking at a financial document and it's a bit confusing, you might say to a family member: I don't really understand this.",
  "Could you have a look at it with me?.",
  "Two heads are better than one.",
  "I think this statement's true.",
  "Except if it's a university group assignment.",
  "Then you should just do it yourself.",
  "The next one is: Waste not, want not.",
  "This one means that if you don't waste things, you will always have enough.",
  "Here \"want\" actually means \"lack\". It's a little formal and old-fashioned to use \"want\" like this, but people sometimes still use it that way.",
  "So this proverb means if you're not wasteful, you won't lack things.",
  "For example, you could say: I always save leftover food for later because waste not, want not.",
  "Obviously if you're not frequently throwing away food, you will save money.",
  "It's also better for the environment.",
  "The next one is: A watched pot never boils.",
  "This one is essentially about impatience.",
  "You know how sometimes you might put some water in a pot and then put it on the stove, and you need to wait for the water to boil before you can put food in it?.",
  "So you stand there watching it and it seems to take forever?.",
  "Well, that's the idea in this proverb.",
  "It means that if you're impatient for something to happen, it will seem to take longer.",
  "Something that I think a lot of people can relate to is sending a message to somebody who you're interested in romantically.",
  "You might then check your phone constantly to see if they've replied.",
  "If you're doing that, someone might say to you: A watched pot never boils.",
  "This one is: Where there's smoke there's fire.",
  "This means that if something bad is being said about something or someone, or if rumours are being spread, there's probably an element of truth there.",
  "It might not be entirely true, but it's probably partly true.",
  "For example, if there's a rumour going around that Frank caused some arguments in a bar and he says that none of it happened, I could say: Well, Frank, where there's smoke there's fire.",
  "The last one is: You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.",
  "This one means that you can give somebody the opportunity to do something, but you can't force them to do it if they don't want to.",
  "Normally we just say: You can only lead a horse to water.",
  "Sometimes teachers think this when they're in a classroom.",
  "For example, if you give your students very simple homework or if you make suggestions on how they could perhaps improve their skills, and then they don't do it, you could say: You can only lead a horse to water.",
  "I hope you're not one of those students.",
  "Another example is if somebody hosts a party with food, and they put out knives and forks, but then people like me just eat with their fingers, that person could say: You can only lead a horse to water.",
  "I hope you found that helpful.",
  "I hope you learned something.",
  "If you did, please hit the thumbs up.",
  "Let me know in the comments if any of these proverbs exist in your language, or if there are any close equivalents.",
  "Thanks very much for watching, guys.",
  "I'll see you next time.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfhBlFz94J4&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=13\">I'll see you next time.</a>",
  "Hi everyone, welcome back to English with Max.",
  "In this video we're going to look at some household vocabulary.",
  "Some of these words are quite basic, but some of them are relatively advanced.",
  "They're words that all native speakers know, but that non-native speakers often only learn if they've lived in an English-speaking country for a long time My mum has very kindly agreed to help me again with the filming, and if you'd like to say hi to her you, can do so in the comments section.",
  "Don't forget that you can also follow me on social media, and if you'd like to learn more advanced vocabulary, you can also sign up for my free advanced English email lessons.",
  "You'll find the link in the description.",
  "Okay so we're going to start in the bedroom.",
  "Here we have a bed.",

  "This here is the bed frame.",
  "So the part that you put the mattress on is the bed frame.",

  "Under that we have some blankets.",

  "It's called a fitted sheet because it fits onto the mattress.",
  "Here we have some pillows.",

  "This is the window.",
  "This part here is called the window sill.",
  "The window sill.",
  "Uh okay... These are blinds.",
  "You can just say \"a blind\" if it's all the one piece, but when it's in pieces like this we call them \"blinds\". These are vertical blinds.",
  "I think it's obvious why we call them that.",
  "Now this thing here is a bedside table.",
  "Bedside tables don't always look like this - they don't always have a drawer, for example, but if you have a small table next to a bed, it's called a bedside table.",
  "This is a drawer, like I said.",
  "Um... be careful because in British English we don't pronounce the ER at the end.",
  "We just say \"drawer\". Emm... Here we have my glasses and the glasses case.",
  "This is a glasses case.",

  "Any little piece of material that you use to clean something is usually called a cloth.",

  "If you want to get big strong arms like me, you can lift some weights.",
  "This behind me is the wardrobe.",
  "You could also call this a cupboard or cupboards, but the word \"cupboard\" is a bit more general.",
  "For example, you have cupboards normally in the kitchen and sometimes also in the bathroom.",
  "A wardrobe normally just has things like clothes and shoes.",
  "How are you going, Monty?.",

  "Hi guys, welcome back to English with Max.",
  "In this video we're going to look at some nature vocabulary.",

  "But it's a very nice place to come for a walk.",
  "My mum is again helping me film this video.",
  "Hi Mum.",
  "If you'd like to learn more advanced vocabulary, remember that I also send out a free advanced English email lesson every two weeks.",
  "If you want to subscribe to that, you'll find the link in the description.",
  "If you want to improve your grammar, remember that I also have a course on Udemy which covers 55 common mistakes made by English learners.",
  "If you'd like to receive my special discount for that, you'll find the link in the description as well.",
  "Okay, guys, let's get going.",
  "This is the sign that's out the front of the gardens.",
  "Okay, it's not nature vocabulary, but I thought there were some interesting things here.",
  "I think it's quite obvious what these mean: no dogs, no bikes, no skateboards.",
  "They also use reclaimed water.",
  "Basically they're using treated sewage water and you shouldn't drink it.",
  "I guess they have these so they don't get sued...? Some warnings... Um... There are some... uh... like ponds and things, so you should be careful where you walk.",
  "I suppose that's what they mean by \"water hazard\". The ground is a bit uneven in places, so some places it's not totally flat or smooth.",
  "There can be falling branches - in other words bits falling from trees.",
  "And there is some wildlife in here, so there are some animals wandering around.",
  "As they say, use of this facility may be hazardous.",
  "Please be careful.",
  "So we're going to do our best not to fall in the water.",
  "This thing behind me is a pond - this area of water - and the plants on the pond are called lilies.",
  "Oh look, there's an animal.",
  "There's a... some sort of lizard in there.",
  "Can you see it?.",
  "There's some wildlife!.",
  "It's not moving.",

  "Now this here is called a stump.",
  "It's the bit that's left of the tree when it's been cut.",
  "This type of plant here is called a vine.",
  "A vine is a plant that grows on other things.",
  "It sort of climbs and clings to other plants and structures.",
  "What we're walking on here are called paths.",

  "Mangroves.",
  "This thing here is a sprinkler.",
  "It's what they use to water the gardens if there's not enough rain.",
  "Here we have another stump, and on the ground we've got various things... Uh there are lots of dead leaves - these are dead leaves.",
  "And there are also lots of sticks.",
  "Now um... a stick is something like this, but if the stick is quite thin like these ones, we call them twigs.",
  "So a twig is just a thin stick.",
  "Here we have another vine.",
  "Like I said, a vine is a plant that grows on something else.",
  "So here we have a vine growing on this big tree.",
  "Here we have another tree.",
  "(I'm sure you know that word.) The outer part of the tree is called bark.",
  "This is bark.",
  "It's a bit like the skin of a tree.",
  "This here is a big piece of bark that was on the ground.",
  "Some trees regularly shed their bark.",
  "That means that they lose their bark.",
  "The bark falls down.",
  "After they shed their bark, new bark grows.",
  "Here are a couple of things that you don't find in nature, but are still good to know.",
  "This area here where it goes down is a gutter.",
  "You also have gutters in the street and also on houses.",
  "It's where rainwater goes.",
  "These little rocks here are called gravel.",
  "It's uncountable, so we say some gravel.",
  "This plant here is called a fern, so all of these plants here, they're ferns.",
  "This is another type of fern.",
  "This is called a tree fern.",
  "And this here is a bench, which is something that we often have in gardens and parks.",
  "These are the roots of a very large tree.",
