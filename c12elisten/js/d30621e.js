  "i'll be back by evening.",
  "just make sure you remain conscious of this big bad wolf.",

  "the big bad wolf gave a loud laugh.",
  "and brushed off his white powder.",
  "hello kids.",
  "are you ready to become my feast tonight.",

  "one by one he rolled them in a ball and gulped them up.",
  "ah there goes the best one.",
  "oh the second one is under the bed here you go.",
  "in no time he ate all the kids except for the youngest one who was hiding in the clock case.",
  "with his tummy full he burped and left the home.",
  "when the mother returned she was shocked to see the door open.",
  "and waited for the biggest nightmare that might have come true.",
  "the house was all upside down.",
  "the crockery was broken.",
  "the curtains were done.",
  "the chair was broken.",
  "and the kids were nowhere to be found.",
  "she cried for them.",
  "children or children where are you.",

  "he ate up all my brothers and sisters.",
  "what will we do now.",
  "don't worry.",
  "let's go and look for him.",

  "his tummy was so filled that he slept off in a meadow near the house itself.",
  "his nose was so loud that even the branches of the tree were shuddering.",
  "the mother goat very quietly went near him.",
  "and asked her youngest kid to get scissors thread and a needle.",
  "off he went to get them.",
  "the mother goat very quietly slipped open his tummy and took out all her kids from his tummy.",
  "they then filled up his tummy with stones as big as balls.",
  "and then she stitched the tummy with the thread and the needle.",
  "the wolf had such a huge feast after so long and he slept all night.",
  "in the morning when he got up he was so thirsty.",
  "that he tried running to the well.",
  "but his belly was so heavy that he could hardly walk.",
  "he picked up his belly and managed to reach the well.",
  "but the moment he bent down to drink water.",
  "he couldn't handle the weight and fell in the well.",
  "the kids were looking at all of this from their window and shouted happily.",
  "mommy mommy the wolf has died.",
  "now we can play freely outside without any fear.",
  "and they lived happily ever after.",
  "now that was one cunning wolf.",
  "but tofu if you be back to others.",
