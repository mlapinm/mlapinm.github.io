  "in seven years you will do housework for me in my castle.",
  "in your spare time you're allowed to go outside.",
  "but you will always have to wear a bear disguise and live like a bear.",
  "then the demon gave finn a bare coat.",
  "he was surprised because it looked just like a normal jacket.",
