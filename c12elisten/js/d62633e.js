  "Thrilled.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Pay, close attention.",
  "Thrilled.",
  "Very good.",
  "Now what does this word thrilled actually mean?.",
  "So the word thrilled just means extremely happy about something again, extremely happy about something.",

  "So whenever my mom made beans for her, she wouldn't be.",
  "Extremely happy.",
  "Now, maybe you also like beads.",
  "Well, here's an example sentence.",
  "I was thrilled that so many people turned up to the party again, extremely happy.",

  "And then one day they say, Hey, it's time.",
  "You would be extremely happy for them, or you would be thrilled, make sense.",
  "Right.",
  "Okay.",
  "So as we look at the picture again, we see that this young man is through.",
  "And when we go down a little bit to the bottom, we see all this snow and the first word that pops in my head is nippy after me.",

  "I need to take a coat.",
  "When I go outside, this is something my parents loved doing.",
  "So they let my sister and I.",
  "When it's going to be nippy outside, but what about you?.",
  "If you want to use this word, here's the pattern you can use.",
  "It will be nippy.dot dot.",
  "For example, it will be nippy in New York tomorrow.",
  "So you let the individual know the time period when it's going to be new.",
  "Or a little bit cold or chilly outside.",
  "Makes sense.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I think it's time for a quick quiz.",
  "Let me see how much you really understood.",
