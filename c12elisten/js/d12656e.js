  "in the makeup store.",
  "every girl loves makeup tina also.",
  "she went to a beauty store to buy her first makeup kit.",
  "watch the video to learn vocabularies about beauty and cosmetics topic.",
  "hello may i help you are you looking for something.",
  "hi i'm looking for a full basic makeup set.",
  "this is my first time buying those things.",
  "so i don't know what exactly i need apart from lipsticks and powder.",
  "no worries let me help you.",
  "we can find a lipstick for you first.",
  "then maybe i will tell you a bit about the steps to apply makeup.",
  "then we can choose the products according to those steps for you.",
  "okay thanks a lot i'm still not too sure about all these i'm glad you help.",
  "my pleasure let me see you seem to have a light skin tone.",
  "so those lipsticks with bright and deep colors will fit you perfectly.",
  "normally i use pink lipsticks so i want to try some new colors.",
  "let's try this one then maybelline lipstick shade 382 red for me.",
  "it has a moderately cool toned medium dark red with a matte finish.",
  "this one looks gorgeous i like it.",
  "this kind of matte lipstick will stay longer however your lips will feel a bit dry.",
  "so don't forget to soften your lips with lip balm like 10 minutes before applying the lipstick.",
  "okay i will get this one any other recommendations.",
  "let me put it in this basket for you.",
  "how about orange l'oreal brand shade orange avenue 146 satin finish.",
  "it looks somehow wetter and softer but cannot stay as long as a matte finish.",
  "wow i love it very comfortable and smooth.",
  "oh by the way i also need a lip balm can you recommend one.",
  "our customers really love this burt's bees lip balm pomegranate flavor.",
  "smells good i'll take these two also i think that's enough for lips.",
  "okay so let's get over to the face part is that okay.",
  "sure this is the part i have no idea about.",
  "after using moisturizer and sunscreen to protect your skin.",
  "the first step is preparing your face with primer.",
  "using primer under your makeup makes your look last longer.",
  "do you know your skin type.",
  "i'm not sure but i usually have a bit of oil around my nose and forehead but other parts are normal.",
  "i think you have a combination skin type.",
  "for this type of skin i recommend nyx marshmallow primer our bestseller the last month.",
  "how to apply primer can i use my fingers.",
  "yes you pump out a bit of primer on the back of your hand mix it with your finger and dab it all over your face then gently rub it in.",
  "okay i got it.",
  "i think your face doesn't have many flaws you don't need concealer so let's move to the foundation.",
  "okay if you say so.",
  "this is a very important step to have a perfect skin look i suggest these two products.",
  "maybelline fit me or l'oreal true match foundation.",
  "these light shades will suit your skin tone you can try and tell me which one you prefer.",
  "um let me see.",
  "i will take this maybelline one i prefer.",
  "the matte finish it seems to have a better coverage also.",
  "right after foundation you should apply setting powder this step is optional but if you're looking for long lasting crease free makeup you should use it.",
  "sure i want one anyway.",
  "whenever i need a quick makeup look without foundation or reapplying during the day i can use it.",
  "so why not use maybelline fit me powder also great combo for your skin let's take this shade 115 ivory.",
  "okay.",
  "do you need contour and a highlighter to make your face slimmer.",
  "no i think that's too much for me i just need basic kinds of stuff.",
  "okay so skip those things.",
  "you will surely need to blush i recommend this l'oreal peach blush powder.",
  "it has a refreshing peachy color and can be easily matched with many makeup tones.",
  "this one is our signature blush recently.",
  "very lovely i will take it.",
  "i guess those are enough for your facial makeup now let's move to the eye part.",
  "wow it seems a lot to me already.",
  "i know i know i had the same feeling when i bought my first makeup kit.",
  "so you will need eyebrows eyeshadow eyeliner and mascara.",
  "okay.",
  "please help me choose something easy to use i'm really not good at this.",
  "sure.",
  "then use pencil type for eyebrows and eyeliner.",
  "your hair is light brown so let's take these chocolate eyebrows and eyeliner pencils from nyx.",
  "try this on your hand to see.",
  "that's great really fits my hair color give me these two.",
  "okay for mascara trust me you will love this maybelline.",
  "one we have received really good reviews from customers for it.",
  "sure then take this one.",
  "okay finally you need eye shadow do you like any of these.",
  "this palette looks so gorgeous.",
  "right but that palette has kind of two bright colors for you in my opinion.",
  "it will be difficult for you to mix with daily makeup tones.",
  "because this is your first one i suggest you should try a neutral tone.",
  "how about this one same brand and product line from revolution.",
  "let me see.",
  "it has 24 shades that give you everything you need for your look.",
  "from light shimmers warm browns rich golds rusty oranges and dark smoky shades.",
  "this one looks great as well let me take this then.",
  "okay.",
  "i think that's all you need.",
  "oh have you had makeup brushes yet.",
  "no thanks for reminding me i need those two.",
  "there are so many types of brushes what type do i need.",
  "real techniques everyday essentials set is all you need this one has four brushes with a sponge.",
  "you can find the instructions to use those brushes on the back of the packaging but basically it is enough for you to apply foundation to eyeshadow.",
