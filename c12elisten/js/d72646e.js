  "in this video I'm playing three games.",
  "with three very popular chess openings.",
  "Queen's gum made King's Gambit and London system.",
  "actually I crashed the London system.",
  "as always I'm explaining every single move.",
  "so you can learn tips and strategies to outsmart your opponents.",
  "an opening middle game and end game and die.",
  "Game 1 – Queen's Gambit.",
  "and there we go.",
  "today a surprise.",
  "I want to start with the move d4.",
  "this is considered one of the most solid way to play chess.",
  "but he's also having lots of ideas.",
  "so again you want to go out with the bishop.",
  "and now we go with the Queen's garbage.",
  "this is the most played uh opening after D4.",
  "and my opponent is accepting the gun by taking the point.",
  "so now I can show you.",
  "here I suggest to go with the two Pawn strong in the center of the board.",
  "this is very logical my Bishop is ready to take back here.",
  "the knights are ready to go out.",
  "and this is just great.",
  "I have a video on this channel.",
  "about the quiz gamit.",
  "and I should also show the Queen's gamut accepted of course.",
  "so if you want to check it out you find the link in the description.",
  "my boner is very smart.",
  "I have a strong Center.",
  "and if I can do everything well.",
  "I will have a dream position.",
  "so now what to do.",
  "I could take.",
  "I could push.",
  "and I could develop.",
  "I think the best way is.",
  "to always when you can develop a piece.",
  "and protect upon go for it.",
  "so I will develop a knight.",
  "and I'm attacking the spawn.",
  "and I'm defending my own Pawn in the center.",
  "now I take you with the Knight.",
  "the Knight is good.",
  "strong safe healthy full of energy.",
  "and I'm ready to take back here at any moment.",
  "smart move huh.",
  "smart idea.",
  "so my opponent is attacking the Knight.",
  "and once the Knight is moved.",
  "then the queen are traded.",
  "and I cannot Castle anymore.",
  "now how big is the problem here.",
  "I think it's fine I will simply go with the Knight.",
  "back here the night is good.",
  "and then I'm taking back your okay taking taking.",
  "and this Pawn should fall at one point.",
  "now my opponent could play the move with B5.",
  "defending.",
  "but I'm not sure this works.",
  "because let's see.",
  "let's see.",
  "yeah.",
  "they play and now we we attack it in the typical way.",
  "you can always play the movie four.",
  "now this move is not possible.",
  "because you simply take and the pawn is being the reserve hanging.",
  "so you want a pawn and you're going to take also the second phone.",
  "so this is why.",
  "you can't sacrifice that pawn.",
  "and you're usually going to take it back.",
  "now my opponent is attacking the spawn in the center.",
  "but I don't care.",
  "I'm taking gear and I say oh.",
  "no my Pawn.",
  "oh no you can really take it.",
  "actually not you.",
  "you cannot take that pawn.",
  "because I'm pinning here and that's quite painful.",
  "it's not a queen paint.",
  "but still a bishop.",
  "that should be fun for us.",
  "what about this King.",
  "they say that the king is usually weak if cannot be Castle.",
  "well when there are minor pieces this is.",
  "not.",
  "um when the Queens are out of the board.",
  "this is not a huge problem.",
  "also the queen is very quick to go inside the defense.",
  "so we are quite.",
  "we are quite fine this is not a big problem.",
  "instead do you know what is a big problem is this bishop.",
  "because my opponent is just losing it.",
  "now this is attacked twice.",
  "is the protected just one time.",
  "and there is no other way to protect it.",
  "it was important to play the move F5.",
  "you're protecting it with the pawn.",
  "and then to play Maybe Knight here.",
  "and pin the bishop.",
  "and probably black would have saved it.",
  "in this position.",
  "this is quite hopeless.",
  "yeah.",
  "I'll just take.",
  "no it takes probably.",
  "and Rook takes well we'll promote this.",
  "we'll remove this.",
  "this is a check.",
  "the king needs to move.",
  "and then what do we do here.",
  "what do we do about.",
  "okay in this case I think I know.",
  "what I'm going to do.",
  "I just want to bring this bishop here probably.",
  "and yeah but then my opponent plays F6.",
  "okay let's develop here the bishop.",
  "because then I can go here.",
  "anyway this is pain the king cannot Castle.",
  "because the the bishop is hanging.",
  "but it's hard to see.",
  "every time we move a piece.",
  "we need to think what are we living behind.",
  "the King was defending the bishop.",
  "so you couldn't Castle.",
  "this is important.",
  "now there is a final check but again.",
  "not a big deal.",
  "this Knight cannot go anywhere.",
  "it's hanging the pawn cannot take.",
  "because the Rick is hanging.",
  "so my opponent can not move anything here.",
  "the rock cannot move here.",
  "okay this is a check.",
  "I told you this might be the final check.",
  "now the bishop is coming here.",
  "maybe we have still King a fate attacking The Rook.",
  "but this is just not gonna work.",
  "actually the Knight now can go here.",
  "yeah this is a reasonable move.",
  "I'm taking yep.",
  "I'm taking.",
  "and um I am threatening cool things.",
  "I want to find a fast quick Checkmate.",
  "let's go.",
  "with the Knight.",
  "let's go let's go let's go.",
  "we can do it.",
  "we can do it.",
  "we can do it.",
  "okay or maybe not.",
  "Game 2 – King's Gambit.",
  "new game.",
  "we are playing a 1300.",
  "well actually now we are getting to the trading.",
  "oh I played the move the E4.",
  "I forgot.",
  "I was going to play D4.",
  "well we play a complete.",
  "you know.",
  "we see four a bit.",
  "okay we saw the Queen's Gambit.",
  "so we're going to see the king's Gambit.",
  "this is a very sharp opening.",
  "and it's very cool.",
  "usually opponents simply take.",
  "so this gives lots of opportunity.",
  "now we go out with the Knight first.",
  "and then we go out with the bishop.",
  "we are attacking the spawn.",
  "we can go for the center.",
  "this is very lit now Bishop is out already attacking this pawn.",
  "and usually there is a way to defend.",
  "uh the pawn.",
  "yeah to go with G5.",
  "that's exactly.",
  "what my opponent is doing.",
  "you're actually playing good.",
  "I must say okay.",
  "we'll go with D4 looking at this pawn.",
  "and they might go with the move.",
  "oh not okay.",
  "in this case we take the only sense of H6.",
  "was to play the move G5.",
  "now they didn't play it.",
  "so we have a great Center.",
  "look at this.",
  "also all the pieces developed.",
  "perfectly where they want to be.",
  "and now guys I will go for long Castle.",
  "I like it.",
  "there is already an F5.",
  "open meaning that we have chances to attack this King.",
  "also there are possibilities like E5.",
  "there is a possibility of playing.",
  "um H3 G4 G5.",
  "I'm very surprised about this move.",
  "I'm just castling.",
  "moving the Knight again.",
  "well usually you want to develop all your pieces first.",
  "right we don't we say don't move the same piece.",
  "twice in the opening.",
  "we are probably not anymore in the opening.",
  "because I've already developed all my pieces at Castle.",
  "and so we are in a middle game.",
  "where black is in huge trouble.",
  "because their pieces are slipping in the starting Square now.",
  "my opponent is trying to go out.",
  "but training this bishop for the Knight will not be good.",
  "not just because usually.",
  "you prefer to have Bishops in open positions.",
  "because the bishop are very fast to go from one side of the board to the other.",
  "in one single move inside a bit more slow.",
  "they like closed position.",
  "because they can jump around.",
  "but also the G file got open.",
  "meaning that I can use this file to.",
  "attack my king directly without any fear.",
  "what should I fear here.",
  "I have just I can go all in and bring the other Rook.",
  "bring the queen.",
  "attack this bishop.",
  "and say get out of here.",
  "now I take back here.",
  "what we should do is do not trade Queens.",
  "because you are attacking.",
  "so now I knew that.",
  "I knew that.",
  "I'm not gonna trade you are not gonna get my queen.",
  "now there is a sponsor attack.",
  "so if I go simply here on the G file.",
  "what I would love to go.",
  "well my opponent is taking there.",
  "so I will go back here.",
  "I know that for now.",
  "I'm not attacking on the G file.",
  "but I'm ready for it.",
  "so there are so many moves that look spicy for example 95.",
  "attacking here.",
  "also E5 looks great.",
  "I think my opponent really needs to go with night out here.",
  "that's basically their only chance.",
  "because after a night here 95.",
  "they can take with the queen.",
  "and then they are offering again.",
  "the queen trade.",
  "this move is bad.",
  "I just go with the night here attacking the queen.",
  "then my queen is sliding to H6 maybe.",
  "depends where the queen goes.",
  "because this Pawn is pinned.",
  "there is a rook.",
  "and now we go boom.",
  "we're threatening Maze.",
  "and the pawn might push on.",
  "then we have a nice checkmate.",
  "wait wait I already show actually.",
  "the pawn might push.",
  "and then we have a nice move.",
  "let's see push push push.",
  "get back.",
  "and the point is that after Pawn takes.",
  "we give a double check.",
  "check with the bishop.",
  "check with the Knight.",
  "and this is going to be a very nice checkmate.",
  "resignation.",
  "actually resignation.",
  "one more game.",
  "and now we have the black pieces.",
  "and oh D4.",
  "okay I want to show you something else.",
  "let's go with the night out.",
  "and I will show you.",
  "oh no.",
  "okay change of plan.",
  "I will show you how to defeat the London system.",
  "so what you do.",
  "first of all you play the move D5.",
  "so this is very good.",
  "because even if you play the move D5 at move one.",
  "you can play this.",
  "then you push this pawn.",
  "and you want to go with the bishop facing.",
  "the London Bishop.",
  "now what is your opponent doing.",
  "trading or going back.",
  "this is the most played move.",
  "and now you simply Castle.",
  "there we go.",
  "white usually plays always the same moves here.",
  "Bishop Pierce C3.",
  "Knight dare Castle always the same.",
  "and we will have a very strong plane.",
  "we will exploit the fact.",
  "that myopod the opponent is going a bit slow.",
  "okay Knight E5 actually a great move.",
  "and now we always C5.",
  "we are attacking the center.",
  "uh I must say Knight E5.",
  "I think is the best move in this position.",
  "uh usually they play a bit more random.",
  "with other moves like C3 Bishop here.",
  "but this is a great move Knight only E5.",
  "now we play Queen on C7.",
  "so we are attacking this annoying night another time.",
  "and basically all the next moves will be around.",
  "getting rid of this Knight.",
  "and it will be a long maneuver.",
  "so take notes.",
  "we'll go with the Knight here on C6.",
  "and we might play B6 Bishop B7.",
  "we might go with the Knight here.",
  "and then finally we can play Knight on e4.",
  "ready to play the movie E6.",
  "you might say okay.",
  "why did we have to do all this.",
  "and then just go 94 and F6.",
  "because you might be in danger.",
  "if you do it immediately.",
  "your king might be naked.",
  "so you need to first develop all your pieces bring.",
  "the Knight towards the protection of the king.",
  "and then you can go for it.",
  "okay let's play knight out this is very logical.",
  "now we are attacking this Knight.",
  "a one two three times.",
  "right yes so the the Knight had to go away.",
  "and now guys I love it.",
  "so this is the idea I want to show you.",
  "here we go in the move E5.",
  "we first take here.",
  "the queen is to take.",
  "and then Discovery attack.",
  "we pushed upon we attacked the queen.",
  "and we are crashing the center.",
  "now this Pawn is attacked.",
  "oh well one two three times.",
  "and it's protected just well.",
  "it's protected three.",
  "I equal one two three.",
  "what what what what.",
  "this queen is to be moved.",
  "and my opponent has still all the pieces at home.",
  "not really a great position here.",
  "okay I'll take with the c Pawn.",
  "usually always stick with the Side Pawn.",
  "also I would.",
  "they want to give Checkmate.",
  "but no.",
  "I push here.",
  "I'm attacking this bishop.",
  "the bishop needs to move and then I push also here.",
  "and I wanna pawn.",
  "and I have the stronger Center that you have ever seen.",
  "Actually I don't even have to push.",
  "maybe I even take there.",
  "just to make everything weaker.",
  "and I think that's what I'm going to do.",
  "open up open up the files.",
  "don't close.",
  "hmm Bishop back.",
  "I will simply take here.",
  "because now the pawn needs to take back.",
  "oh I'm not taking there.",
  "and I always really stress about this point.",
  "I know that there is this temptation.",
  "every time you see a trade.",
  "do you do it.",
  "but don't don't.",
  "usually once you trade you kind of help.",
  "your opponent to improve a better position.",
  "for example after Pawn takes.",
  "now the rock is into the game.",
  "they are threatening Chuck mate.",
  "so why should I beat the first one to trade.",
  "and help my opponent.",
  "I rather develop my Bishop.",
  "get ready to bring the Rooks out.",
  "and if my opponent really wants to trade.",
  "yeah go ahead take here.",
  "now The Rook is attacking here.",
  "so I go back.",
  "you're playing a good position.",
  "you are officially in the middle game.",
  "all the pieces are out.",
  "hassled for both sides.",
  "so we need to make a plan.",
  "first of all you need to see.",
  "what are the weaknesses.",
  "and what are the strength that you have.",
  "so weaknesses honestly.",
  "yes we have just this Pawn.",
  "that is a bit weak your opponent is attacking strength a lot.",
  "so we have a strong Center.",
  "we have an extra Pawn Plus One.",
  "and here my Ubuntu.",
  "that's a weak side over there.",
  "so you know what.",
  "I could play this.",
  "but actually it's doing nothing.",
  "because Bishop here is attacking The Rook.",
  "but I cannot take.",
  "because I would lose my queen.",
  "that's why I'm simply taking here.",
  "I have an extra Pawn.",
  "so training pieces is good.",
  "and now what I said before.",
  "trading is not good.",
  "yeah opening the H file brings nothing to my opponent.",
  "because there is no longer The Rook.",
  "so I'm not helping.",
  "but I'm creating a weakness to Pawns.",
  "in this case the trade is good.",
  "yeah why not.",
  "now the queen is taking.",
  "and do we want to go to the end game or not.",
  "not I don't I don't like end games.",
  "I don't like end games.",
  "maybe I will do some videos about.",
  "how to master end games.",
  "so with some important engines.",
  "that you must know.",
  "and then we can go in the end against.",
  "now we keep the things on the board.",
  "we improve our pieces talking about the plan.",
  "usually either we attack the king.",
  "or we improve our pieces.",
  "or we try to exploit a weakness of our opponent.",
  "and these are all typical plants.",
  "as a rule of thumb.",
  "every time you don't know what to do.",
  "improve your pieces.",
  "my opponent did improve the knight.",
  "now we could bring the Rook into the game.",
  "or we could simply win a pawn.",
  "because this can be taken.",
  "so I think that we take here.",
  "yep I'm sure that this Pawn is also hanging right now.",
  "but for us it's good to trade pieces.",
  "so if my opponent takes we can trade.",
  "well if they take with the bishop is better.",
  "because we can really trade without a problem.",
  "this is a good move.",
  "oh my God.",
  "this is actually a good move.",
  "because my knight is protected just by my queen.",
  "and this line is a bit annoying honestly.",
  "let's see now I'm attacking the Knight.",
  "and where do they go.",
  "maybe Knight on F4.",
  "yeah the problem for them.",
  "oh you know.",
  "this move oh so cool.",
  "ah this is a mistake.",
  "it's a mistake because.",
  "I simply take here.",
  "I'm protecting the Queenie with my knight.",
  "and I'm offering a trade-in right now.",
  "I have two extra pawns.",
  "one here and one there.",
  "after the trades my opponent has a check here.",
  "but that's just a check.",
  "that's nothing more.",
  "if they take I simply take back.",
  "and I have a knight protecting this Pawn.",
  "so still two extra pawns.",
  "and a great position.",
  "we are getting towards an end game.",
  "so let's try to understand.",
  "how to play End Games.",
  "first of all in end games.",
  "the pawns are just strong much stronger.",
  "so what you have to do.",
  "especially when you have extra pawns.",
  "create a past on.",
  "okay we have now an urgent problem.",
  "the Knight is under attack.",
  "so we simply go.",
  "here or with the other Rook.",
  "now with this Rook is good.",
  "I was checking if this Pawn would be hanging.",
  "but the pawn is protected by the Knight.",
  "also this other point is protected by the Knight.",
  "so the Knight is doing an amazing job here.",
  "so talking back about past Pawn.",
  "you need to create a past Pawn.",
  "and try to promote it.",
  "so all these moves are always good.",
  "push and create a past Pawn.",
  "are also Rooks usually there.",
  "are still rocksinian game.",
  "a Rooks are very strong in the seventh.",
  "or in the second rank.",
  "this is where the Rooks are strong.",
  "why because.",
  "uh there are lots of Pawns usually there.",
  "and so you can take the pawns one after each other.",
  "so a rook there is very strong.",
  "now what can we do.",
  "we could go with the Knight here.",
  "aiming for this Pawn.",
  "there's still one thing about.",
  "endgame that I didn't see.",
  "I will say it at the right moment.",
  "when I can do it.",
  "now for night for now.",
  "I want to get rid of this annoying knight.",
  "so I'm attacking here.",
  "and inviting my opponent to take a decision.",
  "do you want to take.",
  "or do you want to keep the Knight.",
  "I think they will take it makes sense.",
  "or maybe not.",
  "okay that's a good idea honestly.",
  "because they say like.",
  "okay Alessia you can take.",
  "you can take you know.",
  "but this Knight is also hanging.",
  "and now my Rook is strong.",
  "there and also now.",
  "they are threatening to block my knight.",
  "but now I have to move F6.",
  "so I give a square to my Bishop.",
  "now what I didn't say about end games.",
  "I didn't say that another thing that you must do.",
  "is to have an active King.",
  "okay so you need to.",
  "bring this King.",
  "this king is now on the corner is doing nothing.",
  "and we cannot do that.",
  "so we need to activate that King.",
  "my opponent is threatening in this chah.",
  "this and this.",
  "that is nearly Checkmate.",
  "so let's avoid that.",
  "okay okay okay okay okay okay.",
  "I was calculating.",
  "I will go with the King here towards the center.",
  "this is important.",
  "the king cannot be on the side.",
  "and cannot be on the corner.",
  "needs to be active in the center of the board.",
  "because basically at the end of of the game.",
  "there are not so many pieces.",
  "that if your king is in the center of the board.",
  "you can't get check made it.",
  "so the king is actually actually an extra piece.",
  "that you can use at your own advantage.",
  "and that's why you have to do.",
  "it now in this position actually with two Rooks and the bishop.",
  "is still quite some material.",
  "so I wouldn't go too far away with the King for example.",
  "if the king is here.",
  "you can get checkmated.",
  "uh so don't go there.",
  "but get closer and still safe.",
  "and for example if the.",
  "if the bishop and a rook is is exchanged.",
  "then you can really go all in with the King.",
  "okay now we get closer as we said.",
  "I could take that pawn at some point.",
  "I didn't take it up to this point.",
  "because I had to be careful about this idea.",
  "every time my opponent gives a check.",
  "after Rook takes.",
  "a rook takes I want to play Bishop there.",
  "that's why I didn't want to remove my Bishop.",
  "but now that my king is so close.",
  "I can simply take.",
  "and maybe cover with the Rook.",
  "or maybe go up here.",
  "that's fine.",
  "I didn't want before to go up here.",
  "because there could have been an annoying check.",
  "that's why now we took another Pawn.",
  "okay the king you see.",
  "the king is going.",
  "now we go also with the King.",
  "and we will bring the bishop here.",
  "then we are oh.",
  "okay my opponent is playing with fire.",
  "huh you're nearly getting checkmated.",
  "not gonna lie.",
  "let's see if we can give a Checkmate.",
  "I don't know if you saw the short.",
  "but I gave Checkmate to have women.",
  "Grandmaster dinabelle and Kai in this way.",
  "it's quite cool.",
  "okay we take here.",
  "give a check and the King goes back.",
  "now I need to activate this Rook.",
  "that was sleeping the whole time.",
  "so we go with the Rook here attacking this bishop.",
  "winning a temple.",
  "um okay this Pawn was captured.",
  "but now.",
  "do I have this.",
  "I'm painting here.",
  "and maybe I can win material maybe.",
  "I mean my opponent has this move.",
  "that is very good.",
  "so actually I blundered.",
  "that was a mistake.",
  "but okay.",
  "trading pieces is good for me.",
  "yep rating trading is good.",
  "now we go.",
  "push here.",
  "I need to start to push the passbone.",
  "this is what I have to do.",
  "we don't have any more Checkmate.",
  "right we said already with a rook and the bishop.",
  "it's very tough to give a Checkmate.",
  "but my opponent is helping me trading pieces.",
  "that's great.",
  "now we have a rook hand game.",
  "and you know what is the best way to support the pawns.",
  "is to go with the Rook behind them.",
  "and then you can you know.",
  "you can just push them without any problem.",
  "and now we put the Rook behind.",
  "and then we will push here.",
  "we'll push.",
  "the Rook might need to stop.",
  "we push.",
  "then we push.",
  "we'll go like this.",
  "and my king is very close to stop this Pawn.",
  "so we don't have to worry.",
  "about it.",
  "yeah we'll just go here stop the pawn.",
  "we're gonna block it.",
  "we have so many ideas.",
  "but we'll just take.",
  "we'll just take take this.",
  "and now we go with the King a very easy way honestly.",
  "when there is a king so far away.",
  "you will just do the following.",
  "I will show you.",
  "okay you will cut the king.",
  "so you just put the Rook here.",
  "and now you will just cut the king.",
  "so the king cannot join you.",
  "you are here.",
  "so the king cannot anymore move on.",
  "cannot get closer.",
  "so you are cutting it out.",
  "and now you just push.",
  "go with the King.",
  "yeah you go with the king.",
  "the king goes here.",
  "and you just say and you keep cutting them.",
  "so they have to just go around.",
  "and then you move the Rook on the other side.",
  "and you will keep pushing.",
  "and there is nothing they can do.",
  "because if they do this move.",
  "to write like trade the Rooks then you win.",
  "then you win the end game with two pawns.",
  "it's completely winning.",
  "so they have basically no way.",
  "nothing to do.",
  "and now we take and okay.",
  "so this is already.",
  "now this is the box of the pawn.",
  "and the pawn cannot be stopped.",
  "so that's great.",
  "all right.",
  "let's avoid the cellmate after this check.",
  "now if we push is still made.",
  "so let's not do that.",
  "and the King can go here.",
  "check.",
  "and now we have checkmate.",
  "and we got to 1300.",
  "hope you enjoyed this video.",
  "remember to like And subscribe.",
  "and you might want to check out.",
  "this other video.",
  "where I win in less than 20 moves.",
  "the queen of my opponent just explodes suddenly.",
  "thank you so much for watching.",
  "see you next time.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lawsQlHKInM&list=RDCMUCev4nu08slP5BSW24OJuSIw&index=21\">see you next time</a>",
  "in this video I played three games.",
  "as always explaining move by move.",
  "and in the first one.",
  "I played against the youngest chess player ever.",
  "alright first game.",
  "guys I think my opponent is the youngest.",
  "is the youngest chess player ever.",
  "look at their picture.",
  "it's insane.",
  "okay there must be a talent.",
  "a huge Talent.",
  "okay we play.",
  "um Spanish scotch or nights.",
  "what is it going to be.",
  "okay Bishop's opening.",
  "uh it's fine this is leading to Italian.",
  "Joko piano.",
  "Joko walto piano.",
  "many possible things.",
  "guys my previous video was an epic fail.",
  "I lost two games out of three.",
  "so what do we have to do.",
  "we have to play better.",
  "I will play faster.",
  "and try to make my moves like like Speedy Gonzalez.",
  "like not uh not.",
  "um explaining in my opponent times.",
  "so what I do here.",
  "this is called Joko piano.",
  "my opponent is playing C3 and D3.",
  "now B4 attacking the bishop.",
  "I just have to be careful about one thing.",
  "that I don't lose this piece.",
  "right after this.",
  "if the pawn would be already on A4.",
  "this bishop would be trapped.",
  "so I shouldn't do that.",
  "um but if I go here there is the move before.",
  "and then after I move this Knight.",
  "well this Pawn is lost.",
  "okay should this worry me.",
  "no I don't think so know.",
  "because I will go here anyway.",
  "and if they play B5.",
  "I'll go with the Knight here.",
  "they take.",
  "okay let's go here.",
  "they take.",
  "and then I play okay.",
  "and now just get back home.",
  "and they have to move the Knight again.",
  "and then I take the bishop.",
  "they have to take.",
  "and this point is free for me.",
  "so I would be very happy if they take this pawn.",
  "please take that pawn.",
  "no they didn't.",
  "come on.",
  "okay fine you're attacking your work.",
  "I could play this move just defending.",
  "and defending also the pawn.",
  "uh blah blah blah blah.",
  "I could also just take here.",
  "and say like I don't care you can take it to work.",
  "but I won't do that.",
  "I will just play the move D6.",
  "that's very good.",
  "I'm blocking this diagonal for the bishop.",
  "I'm ready to develop another piece.",
  "and I'm still attacking this bishop with my knight.",
  "and also I mean.",
  "I'm also attacking the pawn.",
  "because once I take here.",
  "bing boom bang.",
  "I say I win a pawn.",
  "I can also take first here with the idea of thinking there.",
  "but this is more precise to take on C4 first.",
  "okay my opponent is going back.",
  "this makes lots of sense.",
  "I'm taking there.",
  "I'm taking there.",
  "and I'm going to enjoy my Bishop pair.",
  "we develop.",
  "my opponent didn't.",
  "um still develop all the pieces.",
  "didn't Castle instead.",
  "we did everything.",
  "we have the bishop pair.",
  "they wasted lots of tempo to push these pawns.",
  "you know to go around to go back with the bishop.",
  "this position is not amazing for my opponent.",
  "now I'm trying to really go all in.",
  "uh because I want to go with the Knight here.",
  "attacking Point number one.",
  "point number two.",
  "or maybe to play the move F5.",
  "to bring the Rook into the attack.",
  "uh this bishop is so sad.",
  "because he's blocked by my pawns.",
  "so I really love my position here.",
  "okay it seems like my opponent is not sure.",
  "where they want to Castle.",
  "I think the movie 3 would have been a good idea.",
  "but now this Knight is going there.",
  "attacking this Pawn.",
  "attacking that pawn.",
  "um and if they go along Castle well.",
  "they are crazy.",
  "because I mean it's so easy to open up the a file.",
  "and they will be in big troubles very soon.",
  "okay talk.",
  "I think I will simply take this Pawn.",
  "so I will take here giving a check.",
  "the king will move then.",
  "I take here Knight takes.",
  "bing boom bang.",
  "and I.",
  "can go simply back all the way my.",
  "opponent cannot Castle anymore.",
  "uh cannot.",
  "um lost the pawn.",
  "and I'm going to attack.",
  "I'm going to play the move at five for real.",
  "open up the file.",
  "and then give checkmate.",
  "it's very cool.",
  "that my pawn does this bishop.",
  "and not the light square one.",
  "because like this I can simply play this move.",
  "and be very happy with it.",
  "now this bishop is attacking here.",
  "so if I push there after being.",
  "the file is going to be closed.",
  "but if is it possible to play.",
  "bing bong bong.",
  "because I'm attacking one.",
  "and two well if Knight takes.",
  "I take there.",
  "I will go for it.",
  "I'll go for it.",
  "let's go.",
  "bring all the pieces to the attack.",
  "oh wait I just noticed that.",
  "after being if I take there is bong.",
  "attacking my queen.",
  "but so good I can simply move.",
  "and if the Knight moves away.",
  "I take there okay.",
  "it's all good.",
  "we take there calculations.",
  "Bishop here Bishop there.",
  "we can simply move the queen up.",
  "the Knight moves.",
  "if the pawn takes.",
  "we just take here.",
  "and if the Knight moves.",
  "we take here.",
  "and the queen has to take.",
  "and we should be happy about it.",
  "okay I think we can enjoy this Little Pony.",
  "and at the end of the story after all the trades.",
  "we will have just a queen.",
  "and a rook remaining against all the other pieces.",
  "so um objectively it's like material is balanced.",
  "but with that King weak.",
  "the queen can do so much danger.",
  "it's insane.",
  "so after all the trades.",
  "we're going to give a check here.",
  "and then first of all.",
  "I can collect so many points.",
  "I can take this Pawn.",
  "I can take this Pawn.",
  "or both of them.",
  "um so I think I'm winning here.",
  "take here and we take here.",
  "okay my opponent would like to trade Rooks.",
  "I mean I could take.",
  "wait a second.",
  "I mean if I take here.",
  "I mean or what if I play this directly.",
  "because what exactly is this bishop going.",
  "not here.",
  "not here not here not here.",
  "okay I take that's fine.",
  "you can give a check with the Knightor with the Rook.",
  "but nothing changes.",
  "the result is the same.",
  "I move the king here.",
  "and I'm going to take there.",
  "it's going to be nice.",
  "really nice.",
  "really nice.",
  "okay this move is threatening absolutely nothing.",
  "because I can simply take.",
  "and there is a check here.",
  "oh sorry with Rook.",
  "then I can move and this is not Checkmate.",
  "if a pawn would be there.",
  "and that would be a different story.",
  "but like this it's all good.",
  "Now The Rook is protecting the pawn.",
  "um I will simply take here.",
  "so get also my queen away from the King avoid the forks.",
  "there was like the temptation to.",
  "say like.",
  "okay I'll play King gear attacking the Knight.",
  "but then there is a fork.",
  "so better to get the queen far away.",
  "as far away as possible.",
  "okay now to win.",
  "we have to create a pass pawn.",
  "so let's let's go somehow.",
  "somewhere.",
  "wait.",
  "I was doing it again.",
  "going gear means.",
  "you lose the queen.",
  "that's not good.",
  "also I have to be careful to a sort of Checkmate.",
  "okay I'll go with the queen here.",
  "attacking this pawn.",
  "I have to be careful to a checkmate.",
  "with the Knight here.",
  "in gear and The Rook there.",
  "if this one wouldn't be there.",
  "it would be Checkmate in two moves.",
  "I mean sometimes just is insane.",
  "that you would like.",
  "throw your own Pawn out of the window.",
  "that could happen in Blitz Games.",
  "imagine like Knight check.",
  "then you press the clock the pawn disappears.",
  "don't do that.",
  "okay the king moves there.",
  "now we push.",
  "we move the king.",
  "the rookies hanging.",
  "check.",
  "check push.",
  "stages.",
  "nice nice game.",
  "check shortly the analysis.",
  "this was a perfect game.",
  "2400 rating and 90 accuracy.",
  "Game 2 - Sicilian.",
  "new game.",
  "I'm playing versus 2016.",
  "those players are strong.",
  "so I need to focus.",
  "they are playing uh the Sicilian Defense.",
  "I play all all the anti-sicilian.",
  "I don't play the open system.",
  "which is the main main line.",
  "and it goes with D4.",
  "but here I'm playing the Rosa limo.",
  "I have a video about this on the channel.",
  "so you can learn how to play this opening.",
  "my opponent is protecting the Knight with the queen.",
  "I will simply Castle.",
  "the idea of all these openings together.",
  "is that I don't want to play D4 immediately.",
  "but I want to play first C3.",
  "and then D4.",
  "so once upon are exchanged.",
  "I remain I stay with two strong pawns at the middle of the board.",
  "that's my plan.",
  "now my opponent needs to be careful.",
  "because I could go with the multi-5 painting.",
  "well attacking the Knight.",
  "that is already pinned and win a piece.",
  "okay dear we're attacking my Bishop.",
  "I have different options.",
  "I could either take or go back or play Queen A4.",
  "with the idea that this one is pinned.",
  "because the route could be hanging.",
  "if I play Queen A4 there is Bishop D7.",
  "and honestly.",
  "that's not such a big deal.",
  "so I will go with the bishop actually here.",
  "because I don't want to provoke the move B5.",
  "because it's a good move for my opponent.",
  "they want to develop the bishop here in fiancato.",
  "attacking this Pawn at the center.",
  "so here my plan is the following.",
  "just develop as fast as possible.",
  "knight here.",
  "Bishop here Rook here.",
  "and say hi to the queen.",
  "that is in the same file of The Rook.",
  "I queen.",
  "okay night out.",
  "uh we can go with the fish appear there.",
  "which one to pick not sure.",
  "uh we'll go with the bishop here.",
  "it feels like very solid.",
  "um Rook Here and Now.",
  "attention attention attention.",
  "because if Castle.",
  "I might even deploy the move E5 or D5.",
  "okay the queen goes away.",
  "I'll play D5.",
  "I mean I'm crashing the center.",
  "anyway.",
  "um the question is where is this knight going.",
  "because okay there we go.",
  "now I'm taking.",
  "I'm happy to take there.",
  "and look at this position.",
  "I will go.",
  "I think with the bishop here.",
  "I'm threatening to take everything there you know.",
  "and if my opponent takes.",
  "I can take with the Knight.",
  "and my knight is so strong.",
  "whatever piece goes to D5 is going to be so strong.",
  "are all those weaknesses.",
  "okay should I take with the bishop with the Knight.",
  "I'll take with the Knight.",
  "I'm now.",
  "my opponent cannot Castle.",
  "because I lose a piece.",
  "uh this Pawn cannot really be taken.",
  "come on.",
  "um I I don't see an immediate immediate immediate right.",
  "but at least I can say there.",
  "and the King can no longer castle.",
  "and this is not good.",
  "but of course I have also Bishop B6 attacking the Queen.",
  "the queen moves.",
  "where actually the queen is lost.",
  "because the queen cannot move anywhere.",
  "but whatever even if the queen.",
  "would have a square.",
  "I would have a check here.",
  "and I would win an exchange.",
  "so my opponent will probably take here.",
  "and then I take with the bishop.",
  "because I don't want to trade the queens.",
  "and I'm attacking this pawn.",
  "and also this Pawn.",
  "so for example.",
  "Brook is protecting the pawn.",
  "I take here.",
  "after king take my queen.",
  "is taking back the bishop.",
  "okay that's a different move.",
  "played by my opponent.",
  "uh but I have a question guys.",
  "after Bishop B6.",
  "where is this queen going.",
  "not here not here not here.",
  "not here not here not here.",
  "not here not here.",
  "oh here here.",
  "going here.",
  "and I mean I have at least like check.",
  "and I will never Rook.",
  "I don't wanna peace.",
  "I don't wanna sorry.",
  "I don't want an exchange.",
  "I want a rook full one.",
  "because after check.",
  "the King has to go there.",
  "and then I take that's it.",
  "knife.",
  "Game 3.",
  "okay guys let's try to do the perfect video.",
  "when when all these three games.",
  "E4.",
  "neither this is the Ninja witch defense.",
  "so we'll go with two Pawns in the center of the board.",
  "not sure why what my opponent is doing with the movie six.",
  "they want to push here.",
  "okay but what if.",
  "I push D5.",
  "thanks to the Knight get out of there.",
  "taking space.",
  "I take another Knight has to move again.",
  "okay fine.",
  "um I will develop.",
  "okay so nine made really a very long very long way.",
  "now I think these six will be played.",
  "but then all all the pieces of my opponent are really fighting for little space.",
  "I go with the bishop out.",
  "I want to see where the this bishop goes.",
  "okay perfect.",
  "I Castle I will play the move C4.",
  "I will play the move Knight here.",
  "neither.",
  "uh if Bishop there.",
  "I'm not really worried.",
  "I can simply move this.",
  "I will play the move H3.",
  "so what is this position.",
  "is equal.",
  "material is equal.",
  "piece is the same.",
  "Bishop pair uh for both of us.",
  "and nine pair of night.",
  "but I have more space.",
  "due to those pawns.",
  "uh so I can really try.",
  "what I have to do in this position.",
  "not trade piece no no no.",
  "we don't trade.",
  "because my opponent has like really few rooms for all the pieces.",
  "so it's good for me to keep a lot lots of them.",
  "um and then improve all my pieces.",
  "slowly maybe bring the Rook to the E5.",
  "maybe one day.",
  "I will try to push here.",
  "but again like really slowly.",
  "it's much easier for me to find a move.",
  "that move for my opponent.",
  "now what are you doing with the queen attacking nothing.",
  "so we'll bring will will bring the Rook attacking a bishop.",
  "that I mean.",
  "it's unprotected.",
  "okay I have the idea.",
  "um to.",
  "like try to organize some sort of attack there.",
  "or maybe not.",
  "you know what I will play knight there.",
  "sorry Bishop here.",
  "because after a bishop there.",
  "I want to avoid Bishop f8.",
  "because would Trader Rooks.",
  "and now Bishop there.",
  "I would simply take their destroy the king side.",
  "that would be really bad.",
  "and if my opponent wants to play Bishop fa.",
  "they have to play H6.",
  "I go here and now the move G5.",
  "which is weakening for real the king side.",
  "so my opponent is to be very careful.",
  "some additional ideas for me.",
  "are to play Bishop back here.",
  "to try to give Chuck mate.",
  "by eliminating the Defensor.",
  "and then sliding with the queen on H7.",
  "I okay my opponent is clearly trying to uh.",
  "like open up the situation.",
  "but they're creating weakness look at that square on B6.",
  "so I have the feeling that it could be being in big trouble.",
  "for example I will I will just I will just move back this.",
  "um can I because what I want to do.",
  "is that I want to let them take.",
  "go ahead.",
  "then I take here.",
  "they have to take.",
  "and I take here.",
  "and I'm attacking this bishop.",
  "I'm threatening this.",
  "so lots of ideas.",
  "I'm also of like like want to trade there.",
  "then I have a disc Fork as well.",
  "well that would be really powerful.",
  "okay but I want to make sure that everything is actually protected.",
  "because after Bishop here.",
  "this Pawn will be then unprotected.",
  "it's not a big deal.",
  "but still I don't want to.",
  "and if I play the move B3.",
  "you have connected fourth.",
  "um after Pawn takes Bishop takes.",
  "Bishop takes.",
  "is night is unprotected.",
  "but who cares.",
  "because I'm going to take there.",
  "okay so I'm playing B3.",
  "perfect perfect.",
  "you know what maybe my opponent can take with the Knight.",
  "that's crazy.",
  "because after Knight takes or Pawn takes.",
  "whatever this bishop is hanging.",
  "and if I take here.",
  "they take back with the Knight.",
  "and you win a full piece of attention.",
  "um okay they took with the pawn.",
  "so I'm taking gear.",
  "now I'm following my plan.",
  "exactly as I wanted to.",
  "they can also take here.",
  "but that's not good.",
  "okay they took there.",
  "I'm taking now.",
  "there are so many threads.",
  "I could say there.",
  "I could take here and give a fork.",
  "I could give a fork immediately.",
  "hard to find a move for my opponent.",
  "if they take here.",
  "I might have an in-between move.",
  "okay Queen there.",
  "this looks very smart really smart.",
  "it seems like they protected everything.",
  "because if I take.",
  "Queen is taking.",
  "and then yeah.",
  "I could go for this end game.",
  "which is better for me for sure.",
  "but still not even having an extra Pawn.",
  "do you have anything better.",
  "if I take.",
  "they don't take with the queen.",
  "running into the fork by the way.",
  "they take with the bishop.",
  "but maybe this is good.",
  "I mean I take Bishop takes.",
  "and then I take here.",
  "Queen takes.",
  "uh Queen takes.",
  "Pawn takes.",
  "and this hand game must be much better.",
  "like completely winning.",
  "okay let's go.",
  "we take.",
  "and here.",
  "I wanted to take here immediately.",
  "but what about Queen F5.",
  "that's an additional options.",
  "uh option.",
  "because if G6 is not possible loses app ease.",
  "so I was my opponent actually defending domains.",
  "I mean it doesn't seem doesn't seem possible.",
  "because if I play Queen here.",
  "this is track made the Knight is controlling that square.",
  "so there is a check made right here.",
  "I think that's it guys.",
  "okay I see a possible defense.",
  "this king f8 with the idea that after Queen H7.",
  "there is G6.",
  "and this is not hanging.",
  "uh that's not the defense.",
  "I'm so happy.",
  "this was a perfect video with lots of ideas.",
  "and strategies to improve your chest.",
  "make sure to like.",
  "And subscribe.",
  "and check it out this one.",

  "guys in this video I'm trying to reach the rating of 1800.",
  "we have 25 points to go.",
  "let's get started.",
  "first opponent.",
  "oh is playing the okay.",
  "they're promoting everything.",
  "they're playing the London system.",
  "so I will show you how to defeat the London system.",
  "there we go.",
  "so I even have a video where they explain all the theory.",
  "but let's put the theory into practice.",
  "then maybe you can check out that video after.",
  "okay so my opponent is taking here.",
  "so this is a bit of an unexpected move.",
  "I expect a bishop to go back.",
  "I will just take here.",
  "what I will play here is uh play for the move E5.",
  "so I will play Knight there.",
  "okay they are kind of prepared.",
  "they are trying to block it.",
  "other is Mach.",
  "first of all I could win a point here.",
  "but I don't think I want to go farm pawns like this.",
  "I think I will just castle.",
  "that's the right way to go.",
  "and uh then how you play in this position.",
  "you have to develop all your pieces.",
  "but you have a big problem.",
  "look at this bishop is crying.",
  "he's crying right now.",
  "so you have to activate your pieces.",
  "how do you do it.",
  "you will play pown one.",
  "then you will play the move C5.",
  "or maybe first the moon C5.",
  "and then Geto is basically the same.",
  "and then you have to kick this Knight away from here.",
  "how to do it.",
  "you move this Knight to the center.",
  "and then you play F6.",
  "now my opponent didn't play really london system.",
  "because they have played the move C4.",
  "so this changes everything.",
  "but doesn't change my plane.",
  "because I will still go for the center.",
  "right now I have the possibility.",
  "to create really an uncomfortable position for my opponent.",
  "I can take your Pawn take pawn takes.",
  "Bishop takes.",
  "and this Pawn will be isolated.",
  "now I can take back with the Knight.",
  "that's all all right.",
  "if my opponent takes here.",
  "I win the Knight.",
  "so shouldn't happen.",
  "oh good.",
  "all good.",
  "I mean I could take here.",
  "I could take here.",
  "and play so many moves.",
  "but you know what I'll simply play on here.",
  "I want to go with the bishop out.",
  "Brady ORF young kid though.",
  "if I win this game I win 10 points by the way.",
  "that would be lit.",
  "um.",
  "he's wow.",
  "did you know that 1800 can blunder a piece in one move.",
  "yes okay.",
  "I don't even take here.",
  "I just developed a knight protecting the queen.",
  "this is much better.",
  "you know when you are winning on material.",
  "you have two approaches to win the game.",
  "approach number one very simple and quite safe.",
  "trade all the pieces you can trade.",
  "and move to an end game.",
  "usually to win an end game with an extra piece is quite simple.",
  "so you should be able to do that.",
  "second approach as you have more pieces.",
  "you can try to not trade too much.",
  "but give Chuck mate.",
  "because you will have for sure more attackers than Defenders.",
  "so you should be able to to win.",
  "yeah so in this position we are already in an end game.",
  "so it's good to trade as much as I can.",
  "I guess let's bring the work active.",
  "maybe The Rook on the second rank.",
  "also in general this is a general tip.",
  "no matter if you're having an advantage or not.",
  "active pieces.",
  "find the best of each piece.",
  "so this Rook as an amazing.",
  "as an amazing spot here on the second rank.",
  "so that's good.",
  "this bishop is right now slipping.",
  "as so I will have to activate it.",
  "oh this Knight is doing well.",
  "but not really so well.",
  "because they cannot move on.",
  "so maybe this Knight would be perfectly placed here.",
  "one step in front.",
  "but not so easy to get there.",
  "what do we play.",
  "so I have an idea.",
  "I will go with the Knight here attacking the pawn.",
  "and once the pawn get pushed.",
  "I could go either here or there with the knight.",
  "uh and if the pawn doesn't get pushed.",
  "then I will push this Pawn trading my weak Pawn.",
  "for a strong Pawn of my opponent.",
  "okay great let's go with the Knight here.",
  "because I want to push here and then go there.",
  "it cannot Castle because they lose another piece.",
  "so they have to stay with the king in this middle of the board.",
  "okay I don't understand completely this move.",
  "will bring a rook repairing this move.",
  "I have to pay attention not to get a Checkmate on the background.",
  "so I mean.",
  "let's play H6 at the next move.",
  "just just in case.",
  "I mean not really I will not play just in case.",
  "uh you should play just in case.",
  "but I will first open up the center.",
  "and and always keep an eye on it.",
  "because I think like it's more urgent.",
  "to try to remove this pawn.",
  "because like this I activate my Bishop as well.",
  "right now this bishop is crying.",
  "and I don't want to let my pieces cry.",
  "my king could be crying later.",
  "but there is no hurry to play the move H6.",
  "so I will play it.",
  "but later on.",
  "but remember to play that move.",
  "that's that's important.",
  "okay spicy Bishop attacking my Rook.",
  "I'll go to attack this pawn.",
  "and no attention.",
  "because if I play the move H6.",
  "well that's not really a square where my king can go.",
  "uh so I but if I play G6.",
  "okay you know what I'm not in a hurry again.",
  "okay we take a free Pawn.",
  "that's great.",
  "I opponent is speeding up.",
  "I have no idea why.",
  "and how we give a check.",
  "we're about to win The Rook.",
  "they have to go back here with the turkey.",
  "and we trade.",
  "and we push it upon even forward.",
  "this is amazing.",
  "there we go.",
  "now if King hear I'll give a check.",
  "oh my God.",
  "I'm predicting all the moves of my opponent.",
  "and now King hear.",
  "I'll push.",
  "game boom bomb.",
  "or maybe not.",
  "I will go with an idea.",
  "because you know if I would have pushed.",
  "hey let's go here with the Knight.",
  "I'm aiming for the square.",
  "Bang.",
  "wait should I do that.",
  "well I'll play first this.",
  "and then I push.",
  "that's great.",
  "King hear.",
  "that's great.",
  "that's basically.",
  "only move.",
  "okay I'll go here.",
  "I want to take this Pawn as well.",
  "now this root cannot be moved.",
  "because if not this one.",
  "is lost with check.",
  "then I'm pushing this Pawn.",
  "I mean everything I have to do here.",
  "is promote a pawn.",
  "we take.",
  "okay let's play this just in case.",
  "you know.",
  "I don't want to get.",
  "back back rank.",
  "okay we take here.",
  "okay.",
  "and now we can simply do.",
  "what can we do here.",
  "so I would like to give a check.",
  "so I will play over here.",
  "because I want to give a check there.",
  "and then the King has to move and I can push.",
  "whoa.",
  "check everybody.",
  "push everybody.",
  "I removed.",
  "no matter where the king go.",
  "the king can go on E3 from this Square.",
  "they are attacking the The Rook.",
  "but but you see.",
  "bang.",
  "also my Bishop is attacking the other rook.",
  "and I'm promoting.",
  "that's what is very important.",
  "and now we promote.",
  "you're very happy about it.",
  "very happy about it.",
  "my opponent can resign for real now.",
  "but they don't.",
  "they don't resign.",
  "there is a night.",
  "free night.",
  "but I promote check yeah.",
  "it's fine I will go here.",
  "I just want to end this game quite quickly.",
  "okay we'll go here attacking.",
  "then we'll give a check.",
  "and then we'll push this Pawn.",
  "Shaq and maybe bishop here trying to trade.",
  "because there is just one last trick.",
  "is that they want to push here taking this pawn.",
  "I mean.",
  "even if they do.",
  "they don't achieve much.",
  "but let's just avoid that for forever.",
  "now this bishop has to move here.",
  "if they want to keep pieces.",
  "and then my Pawn is just rolling.",
  "and what is very nice.",
  "but it's extremely nice.",
  "okay now an easy trick.",
  "you want to promote this Pawn.",
  "you know what to do.",
  "okay they might just resign.",
  "and I'm saying.",
  "that they might just resign since very long time.",
  "but now they must resign.",
  "no again what you do is that you block this file with the Rook.",
  "right you block it.",
  "and we blink The Rook here.",
  "and then you push and baby the pawn.",
  "and you.",
  "promote and the King cannot get there.",
  "because the Rook is stopping.",
  "the Rick is stopping it.",
  "so it just cannot go there.",
  "I don't know what my opponent is doing listen.",
  "I I will let them do everything.",
  "I will let them promote.",
  "because I have Checkmate.",
  "let's make it funny.",
  "I will let them promote.",
  "yeah push.",
  "no they don't even.",
  "they are not even in time to promote.",
  "oh they are in time to promote.",
  "they can promote.",
  "but there is Checkmate.",
  "yeah that's the point now.",
  "they can just promote with check.",
  "all right.",
  "Bing.",
  "um.",
  "oh my God.",
  "new game.",
  "don't play the London system.",
  "Game 2 - Italian Game.",
  "don't play the London system guys.",
  "new game when playing versus ninja.",
  "they're playing E4 we play E5.",
  "we go with the night out.",
  "we protect.",
  "okay let's go with the Knight here.",
  "let's see do they go fried liver.",
  "no.",
  "but they play night there.",
  "you know that this move.",
  "is not the best move in this position.",
  "usually white is playing them of these streets.",
  "to protect his Pawn with a pawn.",
  "so I say why.",
  "well because now I can take.",
  "and you might say.",
  "what what this Knight can't be taken.",
  "but now we have a fork.",
  "and that's the trick.",
  "we took upon.",
  "we have fork.",
  "right now.",
  "we got a very nice position.",
  "where we already have the bishop here.",
  "my opponent is now going back.",
  "attacking Queen.",
  "I mean we'll simply Retreat.",
  "all the way back.",
  "now we have the bishop here.",
  "that's the only the only difference.",
  "meaning that.",
  "we have two Bishops.",
  "my opponent has a bishop and the Knight.",
  "you might ask.",
  "okay but both pieces have a value of three.",
  "what do you mean by Bishop AOL.",
  "the bishop pair means.",
  "that you have the pair of Bishop.",
  "meaning that with these two Bishop.",
  "you can control every single Square on the chess board.",
  "which is quite cool.",
  "especially when there is not a block Center.",
  "so if the center will be blocked by many pawns.",
  "that cannot be moved.",
  "then the bishop or don't have much space.",
  "but in this position the center is so much open.",
  "that the bishop are having such a fun time.",
  "and difference between a bishop and the Knight.",
  "is that the bishop can move.",
  "so fast from one side to the other of the board.",
  "so if there is not a crowd in the center of the board.",
  "they are very fast to move from one side to the other.",
  "the Knight instead is very slow.",
  "can jump around.",
  "but in close position the Knight can still jump around.",
  "so that's the difference.",
  "open position great Bishops.",
  "uh close position very nice.",
  "what do we do here.",
  "so we castle and we developed.",
  "so it's time to make a plan.",
  "what's our plan.",
  "uh we have more space in the center.",
  "we have an open position.",
  "what we can try to do is to improve really all.",
  "so what do we need to improve Zelda Queen Under Rook.",
  "so we bring the queen up connecting the Rooks.",
  "and then we bring the Rooks to the open files.",
  "e file and D file.",
  "this is not really opened file.",
  "because open file are those.",
  "where no pawns is standing.",
  "uh those are semi-open files.",
  "but still great works.",
  "or at least the great files for the drugs in such a position.",
  "now as I said before.",
  "the Bishops are better in open positions.",
  "so I don't want to trade this bishop for the Knight.",
  "so I simply go back.",
  "this looks like a passive square.",
  "but still.",
  "there is not really a difference from this place to this place.",
  "because still the bishop is controlling all these squares.",
  "not really a difference.",
  "so we bring also this other Rook into the center.",
  "you might have noticed.",
  "that we have Castle on opposite side of the board.",
  "and if you watch my video since sometime.",
  "you might know that I stressed the points.",
  "that when opposite side costly.",
  "you have to attack.",
  "uh this is true.",
  "you have to attack.",
  "but when the center is open.",
  "you can also just play for the center.",
  "you don't have absolute play for the side.",
  "you absolutely have to play for the side.",
  "when the center is closed.",
  "this position is also fine to play for the center of the board.",
  "and I go with the knight in the center.",
  "you know I made a quote it is the following.",
  "knight in the center makes your opponents render.",
  "you can basically put any piece in the center.",
  "to make your opponents render.",
  "but I think the Knight.",
  "is quite strong.",
  "so it works very well with Knight.",
  "but you can say the same.",
  "like a queen in the center.",
  "uh Bishop in the center.",
  "but Knight in the center is very strong.",
  "so now what do we have.",
  "we have the bishop pair versus the Knight pair.",
  "and I have a very Insidious move.",
  "well or series of move.",
  "I could go Queen D5.",
  "then Queen here is sneaking my queen.",
  "maybe even sacrificing the bishop.",
  "I think this is a great plan.",
  "so I will start to go.",
  "would be so good.",
  "to bring a rook also.",
  "but the Rook cannot go through this Square.",
  "because there is a knight that is attacking it.",
  "so how to do it.",
  "I have no idea.",
  "but we'll find a way.",
  "uh maybe I could play C5 C4.",
  "I could try yeah.",
  "it looks nice.",
  "because this Knight is protected just by the pawn.",
  "so this cannot be taken as in the previous game right.",
  "where my opponent took the pawn and then lost the Knight.",
  "not really good.",
  "oh my opponent would like to trade queens.",
  "and they are also threatening this move.",
  "oh.",
  "I might have to trade it.",
  "that's unfortunate.",
  "ET because I would have preferred to keep the Queens on the board in such a position.",
  "okay you know what we'll try to steal.",
  "thus my opponent really wants to trade.",
  "because now I'm saying okay.",
  "get wrecked Queen.",
  "get out of here.",
  "um and if they trade.",
  "okay fine we are in an end game.",
  "uh it's not such a big deal as before.",
  "because.",
  "oh they are not trading that's cool.",
  "they also want to go for a spicy position.",
  "that's great.",
  "but I think I will now go for it.",
  "the threat is quite simple.",
  "I want to give a check.",
  "then the King has to move here.",
  "then I take.",
  "then the Rook can protect.",
  "so not sure.",
  "if it's actually the best thing ever.",
  "but you know what we do.",
  "we slide with the Rook.",
  "the Rook is getting to the party.",
  "Rook B5 would be great.",
  "before we couldn't slide on D6.",
  "we said but you see.",
  "there is a way on D5.",
  "then we go on B5.",
  "we are attacking this pawn.",
  "why didn't I give a check and gear intake there.",
  "because there are Rooks.",
  "that are coming to defend the king.",
  "and I don't know if I can really pull.",
  "what.",
  "okay this is nearly Checkmate basically.",
  "okay but I will play first this move.",
  "because I'm attacking this Pawn.",
  "as well which is not so easy to defend.",
  "that if this pawn is pushed well.",
  "this is checkmate in one move.",
  "so my opponent shouldn't do that.",
  "but how do they perfect that pawn.",
  "well if the Knight goes here.",
  "I simply take and I'm going to take their next.",
  "um if Knight here.",
  "I simply take take.",
  "when a pawn attacking this one.",
  "and this king is crying for real.",
  "that King is screwing for hell.",
  "but nobody is responding well.",
  "nobody is basically even.",
  "close to the king to listen the queen.",
  "is just out with the Knight dancing in a nightclub.",
  "not hearing about his own King.",
  "and that's not good.",
  "because now the king is getting checkmated.",
  "the conversation was getting awkward by the way.",
  "let's focus on chess.",
  "but I'm threatening maids.",
  "and I don't think my opponent has something to do here.",
  "oh well the king can start to run run.",
  "oh the Queen the queen is just now.",
  "just now back from the party saying hello there.",
  "but the king is already in big danger.",
  "you know all the enemies enter the house.",
  "and now the bishop has been sacrificed.",
  "because after Pawn takes the Rook.",
  "is sliding sliding sliding.",
  "to give Chucky Chucky maybe.",
  "and there's no way to avoid it.",
  "because if the pawn doesn't take well.",
  "then the bishop is going to take.",
  "and this is also going to be a check.",
  "maybe in a bit more moves.",
  "but still check matey.",
  "Bing.",
  "wait maybe we take with the Rook.",
  "because that's better if we check with Bishop.",
  "then the king is running.",
  "but we don't want to let the king run.",
  "so we take with the Rook.",
  "we are attacking the queen.",
  "oh spicy.",
  "I mean if I take one.",
  "takes it.",
  "looks funny.",
  "because you know there could.",
  "be some some some potential Checkmate.",
  "spoiler there is no Checkmate.",
  "but I don't have to risk anything.",
  "so I'll just move my king away.",
  "and if you want to take the Rook.",
  "go ahead I'll take your queen.",
  "actually not.",
  "I'll give you checkmate.",
  "and that's what I'll do.",
  "yes and this is going to be Checkmate anyway with a bishop.",
  "look at this.",
  "because there is a rook here.",
  "that is controlling.",
  "that was controlling those two squares.",
  "ggs.",
  "alright guys with the next game.",
  "we can get to 1800.",
  "Game 3 - DISASTER.",
  "let's go.",
  "if we don't win this game.",
  "this video is an epic fail.",
  "and I'm going to publish it anyway.",
  "so let's go.",
  "E4 E4 E5 great.",
  "so what do we play.",
  "so guys I will play something.",
  "that I was playing.",
  "when I was on level of 1800.",
  "which is the fortnite.",
  "I don't know if.",
  "you've seen this opening.",
  "you go first out with the Knight.",
  "and it's called four nights.",
  "because usually.",
  "uh both players.",
  "are putting out their Knights first.",
  "now my opponent went out to the bishop.",
  "which is actually a mistake.",
  "because now I'm going with the Knight here.",
  "and and smashing it in the center.",
  "Game 3 - 4 Knights to get to 1800!.",
  "if they take you might have seen this in the previous game.",
  "because you go with the fork in the center.",
  "attention this doesn't work all the time.",
  "if you have a bishop here.",
  "you will get wrecked.",
  "because the Knight can capture the bishop and you lose.",
  "so be careful at the right timing.",
  "you need to do this.",
  "just when the bishop is not on C4.",
  "now I'm happily taking hear.",
  "and I have an extra Pawn.",
  "is my opponent doing it here.",
  "so there is a bishop still hitting here.",
  "so it seems like the screen could go here.",
  "and thread and Chuck mate.",
  "but it's not a big deal.",
  "because the query is not also attacking this pawn.",
  "as the pawn is already defended.",
  "so not good.",
  "but tease this move.",
  "why H6.",
  "okay I think my opponent wants to develop this Knight.",
  "avoiding the bishop.",
  "avoiding that the bishop could go there.",
  "okay but what if I slide with my queen here.",
  "attacking this Pawn.",
  "looks fancy.",
  "Papa.",
  "Papa.",
  "I like to go there.",
  "yeah I like this.",
  "because my opponent played a move.",
  "that is weakening.",
  "this king's side.",
  "now if they push also G6.",
  "well there needs really weak.",
  "and it's really weak.",
  "then I can even go back with the queen.",
  "because I say like I don't want to stay here with the queen.",
  "because D5 isn't coming or D6 or D5 isn't coming.",
  "and my bishop.",
  "and the bishop is attacking the queen.",
  "so there is not a this is not a safe Square for the queen.",
  "but I was thinking this pawn.",
  "and if I can provoke a weakness.",
  "I'll be very happy.",
  "and oh hell yeah.",
  "I provoked a huge weakness.",
  "because my opponent is no longer going to Castle.",
  "that's nice.",
  "okay so we go back as we said.",
  "because I don't want to stay with the queen there.",
  "we promote what we want.",
  "and what we wanted and now it's very good.",
  "we are threatening checkpoint attention everybody.",
  "uh how to keep going.",
  "I need to activate all my pieces.",
  "but I don't see a way to keep going.",
  "so I will simply Castle.",
  "which is always a great move.",
  "now if this Pawn is pushed.",
  "I will push my own Pawn attacking this one.",
  "one more time.",
  "let's notice that this Pawn is also pinned.",
  "so cannot take.",
  "and also the bishop cannot take.",
  "because I would simply take this Pawn cannot take back.",
  "so it would be a loss.",
  "how to go on here with white.",
  "we have to improve all the pieces.",
  "we have to bring this bishop to the action.",
  "and hopefully also try to bring the rooks.",
  "not so easy.",
  "but we'll find a way.",
  "for example already a way could be to make a fiancato.",
  "it looks quite nice.",
  "painting this night.",
  "also we can improve the night.",
  "we can bring the Rooks to the D and D5.",
  "all these moves.",
  "look great.",
  "okay so the Knight is attacking this Pawn.",
  "I was frozen for a second.",
  "I think I can protect it with the bishop.",
  "basically the only way.",
  "because I could push.",
  "but doesn't looks nice.",
  "oh look at Bishop here just protecting.",
  "the night Channel take of course.",
  "because after Knight takes.",
  "I'd say queen takes.",
  "and boom Checkmate.",
  "so that pawn is not hanging.",
  "okay Bishop here.",
  "my opponent really wants to take the pawn.",
  "you're doing.",
  "really great.",
  "okay I don't know.",
  "why I'm thinking.",
  "um so what do we do here.",
  "actually my opponent has done really good job.",
  "I have to admit.",
  "they played good.",
  "I'll just bring the Rook game.",
  "and you know maybe we will just have an equal position.",
  "it took I will take.",
  "on the night takes.",
  "and I have to go with the queen back.",
  "so what do we get.",
  "we have a position with equal material the only thing.",
  "that we have is that I have more active pieces.",
  "because they're just developed this bishop is still stuck.",
  "this king is also in danger.",
  "now I feel like this move looks really nice.",
  "and now if C6 is played.",
  "I could give a check.",
  "not sure because the pawn is just being pushed.",
  "okay I'll we'll just go here with the Knight.",
  "maybe aiming for the square.",
  "and still this bishop is not developed.",
  "and now if the move D6 is played.",
  "maybe I have the motif.",
  "okay um.",
  "King there the king is running here.",
  "that's a grain move.",
  "but I'll trade it possible.",
  "because this Bean can take the pawn.",
  "guys I think I have a giga smart move.",
  "it's a silent move.",
  "that is not threatening much.",
  "but is blocking everything.",
  "and this is the following.",
  "basically what we are doing.",
  "is that this Pawn cannot be moved anymore.",
  "so this bishop is not going out.",
  "and if the bishop is not going out.",
  "this way.",
  "well it has to go out this way.",
  "which is not so promising.",
  "because there is another Point here.",
  "so it's really it's really ugly.",
  "now this is also a free Pawn.",
  "this is also a free check.",
  "and now we go with the Knight here.",
  "that's great.",
  "we are about to give checkmates here.",
  "there are just so many threads.",
  "I think my opponent.",
  "oh it's happening yes.",
  "if King goes here.",
  "it's Checkmate.",
  "if the King goes here.",
  "we take with the Knight.",
  "and it's a fork to the king and the Queen.",
  "and my opponent might just resign.",
  "it doesn't happen that they always resign on the bank.",
  "but I try that all the time.",
  "yeah yes we got it.",
  "I hope you guys hope.",
  "you guys enjoyed this video.",
  "where I try to explain move by move.",
  "while getting to 1800.",
  "stay tuned.",
  "because lots of other videos are incoming.",
  "and you might want to check out this one.",
  "remember to like.",
  "And subscribe and see you next time."
