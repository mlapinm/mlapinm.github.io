  "Welcome to the Google Data Analytics Certificate.",
  "What do companies in e-commerce, entertainment, healthcare, manufacturing, marketing, finance, tech, and hundreds of other industries all have in common?.",
  "You guessed it, they all use data.",
  "Organizations of all kinds need data analysts to help them improve their processes, identify opportunities and trends, launch new products, provide great customer service, and make thoughtful decisions.",
  "Hi, I'm Tony, a program manager at Google and a data analyst myself.",
  "I like to welcome you to the Google Data Analytics Certificate.",
  "Now, there are lots of great reasons to earn this certificate.",
  "Maybe you're thinking about starting a career in the exciting world of data analytics, or maybe you're just fascinated by the power of data as I am.",
  "No matter what brought you here, you're in the right place to kick-start a career and learn industry-relevant skills in data analytics.",
  "But first, what exactly is data?.",
  "Well, I'll like to say that data is a collection of facts.",
  "This collection can include numbers, pictures, videos, words, measurements, observations, and more.",
  "Once you have data, analytics puts it to work through analysis.",
  "Data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.",
  "And it doesn't stop there.",
  "Data evolves over time which means this analysis or analytics, as we call it, can give us new information throughout data's entire life cycle.",
  "Data is everywhere.",
  "You use and create data everyday.",
  "Have you ever read reviews of a product before deciding whether or not to buy it?.",
  "That's data analysis.",
  "Or maybe you wear a fitness tracker to count your steps so you can stay active throughout the day.",
  "That's data analysis.",
  "But you don't just use data.",
  "You also create huge amounts of it every single day.",
  "Any time you use your phone, look up something online, stream music, shop with a credit card, post on social media or use GPS to map a route, you're creating data.",
  "Our digital world and the millions of smart devices inside of it have made the amount of data available truly mind-blowing.",
  "Here at Google we process more than 40,000 searches every second.",
  "That's 3.5 billion searches a day and 1.2 trillion searches every year.",
  "Here's another way to think about it.",
  "YouTube has almost two billion users.",
  "If YouTube users made up a country, it would be the largest in the world.",
  "All of that data is transforming the world around us.",
  "The publication The Economist recently called data the world's most valuable resource.",
  "It's easy to see why data analysts are so valued by their organizations.",
  "What exactly does a data analyst do?.",
  "Put simply, a data analyst is someone who collects, transforms, and organizes data in order to help make informed decisions.",
  "Besides the role itself, one of the most exciting parts of being a data analyst is the number of opportunities available.",
  "The demand for data analysts is greater than the number of qualified people to fill these job openings.",
  "This certificate program is a great first step in your journey to finding a job you love.",
  "Data analysts come from many different backgrounds and have all kinds of life experiences.",
  "You don't need decades of work experience or an expensive education to get started.",
  "Many data analysts taught themselves the skills they needed to land their first job, just like you're doing right now.",
  "Now let's talk more about what you're going to learn.",
  "The Google Data Analytics Certificate is split into courses based on different processes for data analysis.",
  "Those are ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.",
  "Plan to watch these videos in order.",
  "Each one covers a new topic and every topic builds on what you've learned before, making it easy to track your progress.",
  "You're in the driver's seat.",
  "Even though you might see things organized by weeks, everything can be completed at your own pace.",
  "So you decide how much you want to do each day.",
  "By the end of the program, you'll take everything you've learned and turn it into a project that you can use to show off your skills, and wow hiring managers at your job interviews.",
  "Now along the way you'll also hear from Googlers.",
  "That's what we call people who work here at Google.",
  "They'll give you an inside look at what it's like to work in our industry and share personal stories of how they got into the field.",
  "They'll also give you some excellent tips on how to land your dream job.",
  "Stay tuned.",
  "Some of them are going to introduce themselves in just a sec.",
  "I'm Angie.",
  "I'm a program manager of engineering at Google.",
  "I truly believe that cleaning data is the heart and soul of data.",
  "It's how you get to know your data, its quirks, its flaws, its mysteries.",
  "I love a good mystery.",
  "It felt like a superpower almost.",
  "I was a detective and I had gone in there and I'd really solved something.",
  "Hi, I'm Alex.",
  "I'm a research scientist at Google.",
  "I research the different impacts of artificial intelligence on society and our users.",
  "My name is Lilah Jones.",
  "I'm a part of our cloud team.",
  "I get a chance to lead a team of amazing individuals that are focused on helping customers get to the cloud.",
  "Hi, I'm Evan.",
  "I'm a learning portfolio manager here at Google.",
  "I have one of the coolest jobs in the world where I get to look at all the different technologies that affect big data and then work them into training courses like this one for students to take.",
  "I'll be your instructor for the first course.",
  "I'll take you through each module that will cover a specific topic in a few different ways.",
  "You'll have videos, reading materials, quizzes, hands-on activities, and discussion prompts for you to chat about with other students in an online forum.",
  "I'm really excited to be guiding you through this course, but I'm especially excited that you've chosen this adventure.",
  "Lifelong learning is something that I'm very passionate about.",
  "Growing up, when I looked around, I often didn't see many options available to me.",
  "It wasn't until I started getting serious about my education that I realized I had the control to make my own opportunities with education being the key that would open those doors.",
  "The more I learned and the harder I worked, the more possibilities opened up.",
  "Had I not gone after that knowledge and continued challenging myself, I may not be where I am today.",
  "Learning allowed me to grow personally, be successful, visit places I would never have seen, and meet people I would never have known.",
  "Now I'm going to introduce some of those great people.",
  "Hello, I'm Ximena, financial analyst.",
  "I'll be helping you learn how to ask the right questions about data, the project you work on and the problems you're trying to solve.",
  "Hey, my name is Hallie, analytical lead.",
  "I'm so excited to show you how to prepare your data so it's ready for analysis.",
  "Hello, I'm Sally, measurement and analytical lead.",
  "Together we'll cover how to process and clean your data.",
  "Cleaning data doesn't require soap and water.",
  "I'm talking about making sure your data is complete, correct, and relevant to the problem you're trying to solve.",
  "Hey, I'm Ayanna, global insights manager.",

  "My name's Kevin and with my experience as Director of analytics at Google, I'll guide you through what I think is the most exciting part of the data analysis process: plan, create, and present effective and compelling data visualizations.",
  "Hello, my name is Carrie.",
  "I can't wait to tell you about all the exciting things you can do with the programming language R.",
  "Are you ready?.",
  "Hi, I'm Rishie, Global analytics skills curriculum manager.",
  "I'm going to help you bring together everything you learned during this program by creating a case study that will dazzle any hiring manager.",
  "Just like the capstone of a great building shows everyone that it's complete, your case study will signify your own great achievement of earning a Google certificate in data analytics.",
  "Okay, are you getting excited about the potential of becoming a data analyst?.",
  "So much is possible with data.",
  "You're about to enter a whole new world.",
  "Ready?.",
  "Let's go.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/lecture/ZQCdI/introduction-to-the-course\">Let's go.</a>",
  "Introduction to the course.",
  "\"Data!.",
  "Data!.",
  "Data!.",
  "I can't make bricks without clay.\" Any guesses who said this?.",
  "I'll give you a hint.",
  "It wasn't a famous tech CEO, or a data analyst.",
  "The person who said this lived long before the tech companies even existed.",
  "But I bet you've still heard of him.",
  "This line was said by Sherlock Holmes, the famous detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.",
  "What Doyle meant was that Holmes couldn't draw any conclusions, which would be the bricks he mentioned without data, or the clay.",
  "You're probably not here to become a world famous detective, but data is still the building block that you'll use for everything you do in your new data analyst career, Sherlock Holmes would agree.",
  "By starting this program, you've shown that you and Sherlock Holmes have something in common, you both have an interest in learning more.",
  "That's one of the most important qualities that data analysts can have.",
  "Now, there are a bunch of different ways to explore data, but one of the great things about data analytics is that you can often learn how you want, when you want.",
  "That might mean doing your own research, talking with people in the industry, or taking online courses.",
  "With that said, welcome to your first course.",
  "This is your introduction to the wonderful world of data analytics.",
  "Since data analytics is the science of data, you'll use this course to begin to learn all about data.",
  "Data is basically a collection of facts or information, and through analysis, you'll learn how to use the data to draw conclusions, and make predictions, and decisions.",
  "Personally, I didn't jump right into the data analytics field.",
  "I thought data analysis was for computer engineers.",
  "Instead, I started off with dreams of working in finance.",
  "Once I got through an internship though, I realized it wasn't the career path I wanted to take.",
  "I started to learn about financial planning and analysis, and all of the work finance analysts were doing with data.",
  "I realized that finance analysts are really just data analysts working in a finance department.",
  "These analysts were helping to guide business decisions by knowing how to use data.",
  "It was then I realized how powerful data is, and I started to embrace it.",
  "Soon enough, I realized I could do this data analysis myself.",
  "Data analytics is a big open world of opportunity.",
  "There are so many areas that your analysis skills can be applied and in all different ways.",
  "If you're new to this world, you'll learn how to identify which path and industry might suit your skills, and your interests the best.",
  "For those of you who already have some experience, we'll help you open doors to new and exciting opportunities.",
  "One of the skills you'll gain from the program is how to follow the best practices that analysts use to help make data-driven decisions.",
  "Computers are one part of the process, but analysts rely on so much more to make decisions.",
  "That's why learning how to think analytically, and using your other skills and traits on the job will make your work easier.",
  "I know you already know how to make good decisions, you chose to be here after all.",
  "In this first course, you'll learn more about each phase of the data analysis process.",
  "Ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.",
  "As a data analyst, you'll go through these steps as you use data to inform your decisions.",
  "Eventually, you'll see how this program itself is in a way, its own version of this process.",
  "While I know you'll enjoy watching these videos, your trip to the first course will include a whole lot more.",
  "Other videos will take the form of vignettes, where you'll learn from data analytics professionals, who are already established in their careers.",
  "They'll offer words of wisdom as well as tales of their own experiences starting off on their career path.",
  "You'll start your own data journal that will help you keep track of what you've learned throughout the course.",
  "You'll also add your own thoughts about what you're learning as well, throughout the program.",
  "You'll read up on how to navigate this program in the world of data analytics.",
  "You'll complete activities, including some that will help you get in the mindset of a data analyst.",
  "Along the way, you'll also have the chance to connect with your fellow learners.",
  "Discussion prompts will give you a chance to share your thoughts, and at the same time see what your peers think about all that you're learning.",
  "These prompts will help you build a community support system to use throughout the program.",
  "Enough talking, let's get started on this exciting path.",
  "Your next step awaits.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/lecture/N5lvQ/data-analytics-in-everyday-life\">Your next step awaits.</a>",
  "Data analytics in everyday life.",
  "Welcome back.",
  "At this point, you've been introduced to the world of data analytics and what data analysts do.",
  "You've also learned how this course will prepare you for a successful career as an analyst.",
  "Coming up, you'll learn all the ways data can be used, and you'll discover why data analysts are in such high demand.",
  "I'm not exaggerating when I say every goal and success that my team and I have achieved couldn't have been done without data.",
  "Here at Google, all of our products are built on data and data-driven decision making.",
  "From concept to development to launch, we're using data to figure out the best way forward.",
  "And we're not alone.",
  "Countless other organizations also see the incredible value in data and, of course, the data analysts who help them make use of it.",
  "So we know data opens up a lot of opportunities.",
  "But to help you wrap your head around all the ways you can actually use data, let's go over a few examples from everyday life.",
  "You might not realize it, but people analyze data all the time.",
  "For instance, I'm a morning person.",
  "A long time ago, I realized that I'm happier and more productive if I get to bed early and wake up early.",
  "I came to this conclusion after noticing a pattern in my day-to-day experiences.",
  "When I got seven hours of sleep and woke up at 6:30, I was the most successful.",
  "So I thought about the relationship between this pattern and my daily life, and I predicted that early to bed early to rise would be the right choice for me.",
  "And I'm definitely my best self when I wake up bright and early.",
  "I bet you've identified patterns and relationships in your life, too.",
  "Maybe about your own sleep cycle or how you feel after eating certain foods, or what time of day you like to workout.",
  "All of these are great examples of real life patterns and relationships that you can use to make predictions about the right actions to take, and that is a huge part of data analysis right there.",
  "Now, let's put this process into a business setting.",
  "You may remember from an earlier video that there's a ton of data out there.",
  "And every minute of every hour of every day, more data is being created.",
  "Businesses need a way to control all that data so they can use it to improve processes, identify opportunities and trends, launch new products, serve customers, and make thoughtful decisions.",
  "For businesses to be on top of the competition, they need to be on top of their data.",
  "That's why these companies hire data analysts to control the waves of data they collect every day, makes sense of it, and then draw conclusions or make predictions.",
  "This is the process of turning data into insights, and it's how analysts help businesses put all their data to good use.",
  "This is actually a good way to think about analysis: turning data into insights.",
  "As a reminder, the more detailed definition you learned earlier is that data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.",
  "So after analysts have created insights from data, what happens?.",
  "Well, a lot.",
  "Those insights are shared with others, decisions are made, and businesses take action.",
  "And here's where it can get really exciting.",
  "Data analytics can help organizations completely rethink something they do or point them in a totally new direction.",
  "For example, maybe data leads them to a new product or unique service, or maybe it helps them find a new way to deliver an incredible customer experience.",
  "It's these kinds of aha moments that can help businesses reach another level, and that makes data analysts vital to any business.",
  "Now that you know more of the amazing ways data is being used every day, you can see why data analysts are in such high demand.",
  "We'll continue exploring how analysts can transform data into insights that lead to action.",
  "And before you know it, you'll be ready to help any organization find new and exciting ways to transform their data.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/lecture/6cSlb/cassie-dimensions-of-data-analytics\">And before you know it, you'll be ready to help any organization find new and exciting ways to transform their data.</a>",
  "Cassie: Dimensions of data analytics.",
  "Hi.",
  "I'm Cassie, and I lead Decision Intelligence for Google Cloud.",
  "Decision Intelligence is a combination of applied data science and the social and managerial sciences.",
  "It is all about harnessing the power and beauty of data.",
  "I help Google Cloud and its customers turn their data into impact and make their businesses and the world better.",
  "A data analyst is an explorer, a detective, and an artist all rolled into one.",
  "Analytics is the quest for inspiration.",
  "You don't know what's going to inspire you before you explore, before you take a look around.",
  "When you begin, you have no idea what you're going to find and whether you're even going to find anything.",
  "You have to bravely dive into the unknown and discover what lies in your data.",
  "There is a pervasive myth that someone who works in data should know the everything of data.",
  "I think that that's unhelpful because the universe of data has expanded.",
  "It's expanded so much that specialization becomes important.",
  "It's very, very difficult for one person to know and be the everything of data.",
  "That's why we need these different roles.",
  "The advice that I give folks who are entering the space is to pick their specialization based on which flavor, which type of impact best suits their personality.",
  "Now, data science, the discipline of making data useful, is an umbrella term that encompasses three disciplines: machine learning, statistics, and analytics.",
  "These are separated by how many decisions you know you want to make before you begin with them.",
  "If you want to make a few important decisions under uncertainty, that is statistics.",
  "If you want to automate, in other words, make many, many, many decisions under uncertainty, that is machine learning and AI.",
  "But what if you don't know how many decisions you want to make before you begin?.",
  "What if what you're looking for is inspiration?.",
  "You want to encounter your unknown unknowns.",
  "You want to understand your world.",
  "That is analytics.",
  "When you're considering data science and you're choosing which area to specialize in, I recommend going with your personality.",
  "Which of the three excellences in data science feels like a better fit for you?.",
  "The excellence of statistics is rigor.",
  "Statisticians are essentially philosophers, epistemologists.",
  "They are very, very careful about protecting decision-makers from coming to the wrong conclusion.",
  "If that care and rigor is what you are passionate about, I would recommend statistics.",
  "Performance is the excellence of the machine learning and AI engineer.",
  "You know that's the one for you if someone says to you, \"I bet that you couldn't build an automation system that performs this task with 99.99999 percent accuracy,\" and your response to that is, \"Watch me.\" How about analytics?.",
  "The excellence of an analyst is speed.",
  "How quickly can you surf through vast amounts of data to explore it and discover the gems, the beautiful potential insights that are worth knowing about and bringing to your decision-makers?.",
  "Are you excited by the ambiguity of exploration?.",
  "Are you excited by the idea of working on a lot of different things, looking at a lot of different data sources, and thinking through vast amounts of information, while promising not to snooze past the important potential insights?.",
  "Are you okay being told, \"Here is a whole lot of data.",
  "No one has looked at it before.",
  "Go find something interesting\"? Do you thrive on creative, open-ended projects?.",
  "If that's you, then analytics is probably the best fit for you.",
  "A piece of advice that I have for analysts getting started on this journey is it can be pretty scary to explore the unknown.",
  "But I suggest letting go a little bit of any temptations towards perfectionism and instead, enjoying the fun, the thrill of exploration.",
  "Don't worry about right answers.",
  "See how quickly you can unwrap this gift and find out if there is anything fun in there.",
  "It's like your birthday, unwrapping a bunch of things.",
  "Some of them you like.",
  "Some of them you won't.",
  "But isn't it fun to know what's actually in there?.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/lecture/NAs7O/what-is-the-data-ecosystem\">But isn't it fun to know what's actually in there?</a>",
  "What is the data ecosystem?. Hello again.",
  "You've already learned about being a data analyst and how this program will help prepare you for your future career.",
  "Now, it's time to explore the data ecosystem, find out where data analytics fits into that system, and go over some common misconceptions you might run into in the field of data analytics.",
  "To put it simply, an ecosystem is a group of elements that interact with one another.",
  "Ecosystems can be large, like the jungle in a tropical rainforest or the Australian outback.",
  "Or, tiny, like tadpoles in a puddle, or bacteria on your skin.",
  "And just like the kangaroos and koala bears in the Australian outback, data lives inside its own ecosystem too.",
  "Data ecosystems are made up of various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data.",
  "These elements include hardware and software tools, and the people who use them.",
  "People like you.",
  "Data can also be found in something called the cloud.",
  "The cloud is a place to keep data online, rather than on a computer hard drive.",
  "So instead of storing data somewhere inside your organization's network, that data is accessed over the internet.",
  "So the cloud is just a term we use to describe the virtual location.",
  "The cloud plays a big part in the data ecosystem, and as a data analyst, it's your job to harness the power of that data ecosystem, find the right information, and provide the team with analysis that helps them make smart decisions.",
  "For example, you could tap into your retail store's database, which is an ecosystem filled with customer names, addresses, previous purchases, and customer reviews.",
  "As a data analyst, you could use this information to predict what these customers will buy in the future, and make sure the store has the products and stock when they're needed.",
  "As another example, let's think about a data ecosystem used by a human resources department.",
  "This ecosystem would include information like postings from job websites, stats on the current labor market, employment rates, and social media data on prospective employees.",
  "A data analyst could use this information to help their team recruit new workers and improve employee engagement and retention rates.",
  "But data ecosystems aren't just for stores and offices.",
  "They work on farms, too.",
  "Agricultural companies regularly use data ecosystems that include information including geological patterns in weather movements.",
  "Data analysts can use this data to help farmers predict crop yields.",
  "Some data analysts are even using data ecosystems to save real environmental ecosystems.",
  "At the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, coral reefs all over the world are monitored digitally, so they can see how organisms change over time, track their growth, and measure any increases or declines in individual colonies.",
  "The possibilities are endless.",
  "Okay, now let's talk about some common misconceptions you might come across.",
  "First is the difference between data scientists and data analysts.",
  "It's easy to confuse the two, but what they do is actually very different.",
  "Data science is defined as creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data.",
  "Here's a good way to think about it.",
  "Data scientists create new questions using data, while analysts find answers to existing questions by creating insights from data sources.",
  "There are also many words and phrases you'll hear throughout this course, that are easy to get mixed up.",
  "For example, data analysis and data analytics sound the same, but they're actually very different things.",
  "Let's start with analysis.",
  "You've already learned that data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.",
  "Data analytics in the simplest terms is the science of data.",
  "It's a very broad concept that encompasses everything from the job of managing and using data to the tools and methods that data workers use each and every day.",
  "So when you think about data, data analysis and the data ecosystem, it's important to understand that all of these things fit under the data analytics umbrella.",
  "All right, now that you know a little more about the data ecosystem and the differences between data analysis and data analytics, you're ready to explore how data is used to make effective decisions.",
  "You'll get to see data-driven decision-making, in action.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/lecture/gT8Bo/how-data-informs-better-decisions\">You'll get to see data-driven decision-making, in action.</a>",
  "How data informs better decisions.",
  "So far, you've discovered that there are many different ways data can be used.",
  "In our everyday lives, we use data when we wear a fitness tracker or read product reviews to make a purchase decision.",
  "And in business, we use data to learn more about our customers, improve processes, and help employees do their jobs more effectively.",
  "But this is just the tip of the iceberg.",
  "One of the most powerful ways you can put data to work is with data-driven decision-making.",
  "Data-driven decision-making is defined as using facts to guide business strategy.",
  "Organizations in many different industries are empowered to make better, data-driven decisions by data analysts all the time.",
  "The first step in data-driven decision-making is figuring out the business need.",
  "Usually, this is a problem that needs to be solved.",
  "For example, a problem could be a new company needing to establish better brand recognition, so it can compete with bigger, more well-known competitors.",
  "Or maybe an organization wants to improve a product and needs to figure out how to source parts from a more sustainable or ethically responsible supplier.",
  "Or, it could be a business trying to solve the problem of unhappy employees, low levels of engagement, satisfaction and retention.",
  "Whatever the problem is, once it's defined, a data analyst finds data, analyzes it and uses it to uncover trends, patterns and relationships.",
  "Sometimes the data-driven strategy will build on what's worked in the past.",
  "Other times, it can guide a business to branch out in a whole new direction.",
  "Let's look at a real-world example.",
  "Think about a music or movie streaming service.",
  "How do these companies know what people want to watch or listen to, and how do they provide it?.",
  "Well using data-driven decision-making, they gather information about what their customers are currently listening to, analyze it, then use the insights they've gained to make suggestions for things people will most likely enjoy in the future.",
  "This keeps customers happy and coming back for more, which in turn means more revenue for the company.",
  "Another example of data-driven decision-making can be seen in the rise of e-commerce.",
  "It wasn't long ago that most purchases were made in a physical store, but the data showed people's preferences were changing.",
  "So a lot of companies created entirely new business models that remove the physical store, and let people shop right from their computers or mobile phones with products delivered right to their doorstep.",
  "In fact, data-driven decision-making can be so powerful, it can make entire business methods obsolete.",
  "For example, data helped companies completely move away from corded phones and replace them with mobile phones.",
  "By ensuring that data is built into every business strategy, data analysts play a critical role in their companies' success, but it's important to note that no matter how valuable data-driven decision-making is, data alone will never be as powerful as data combined with human experience, observation, and sometimes even intuition.",
  "To get the most out of data-driven decision-making, it's important to include insights from people who are familiar with the business problem.",
  "These people are called subject matter experts, and they have the ability to look at the results of data analysis and identify any inconsistencies, make sense of gray areas, and eventually validate choices being made.",
  "Organizations that work this way put data at the heart of every business strategy, but also benefit from the insights of their people.",
  "It's a win-win.",
  "As a data analyst, you play a key role in empowering these organizations to make data-driven decisions, which is why it's so important for you to understand how data plays a part in the decision-making process.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/lecture/jar62/what-to-expect-moving-forward\">As a data analyst, you play a key role in empowering these organizations to make data-driven decisions, which is why it's so important for you to understand how data plays a part in the decision-making process.</a>",
  "What to expect moving forward.",
  "We've covered a lot.",
  "I'm sure you have so much to think about already.",
  "That's a good thing.",
  "It means you've started collecting data and you're doing your own personal analysis.",
  "That's what it's all about.",
  "You've built a great base already.",
  "As this course continues, your knowledge and data analysis skills will continue to grow.",
  "Once you've established a solid foundation, you'll apply what you've learned to the rest of the program.",
  "The data analysis process will help provide a framework for everything you do.",
  "Soon, you'll take your first graded assessment.",
  "It's a great way to check your understanding of the concepts and build confidence in your knowledge.",
  "Everyone learns at different speeds.",
  "So take your time.",
  "Get familiar with the concepts.",
  "As soon as you feel ready, you can go ahead and get started.",
  "Keep in mind, if at any point, you're not sure about a question, you can always review the videos and readings to remind yourself of the answer.",
  "We're all about open- book tests here.",
