  "would he be sitting in this dark boat waiting for someone to solve his problem.",
  "counting minutes to his door.",
  "no he would use his very intelligent head to get out.",
  "and that is what i am going to do.",
  "and with that inspiration Passepartout  slowly peeped up on the upper deck.",
  "to get an idea about the number of pirates.",
  "Passepartout  then scoured for an easy target.",
  "as soon as the pirate walked toward the opening to the lower deck.",

  "i am sure monsieur is on the way to japan if only wait.",
  "where's inspectofix.",

  "mr fogg why aren't you concerned.",
  "princess mira i don't fret in the face of fate for it is mere foolishness to do so.",
  "i am worried about pasapatu.",
  "but something tells me he will meet us in japan.",
  "i have already arranged for a personal boat.",
  "and the owner of the boat has promised to escort us to japan.",

  "do not disturb me.",
  "i am trying to reach this map.",
  "we have to go to japan.",

  "the pirates are tied on the lower deck.",
  "no matter what do not leave the boat.",
  "i will go and check when the steamer from hong kong will be arriving here.",

  "there was a spectre fix standing alone on the dock holding nothing but his cap without the boat.",
  "huh.",
  "it turns out the pirates overpowered fix.",
  "and took their boats back.",
  "and along with it the money and resources.",
  "that Passepartout and fix had bought along.",
  "are you out of your mind.",
  "are you out of your mind to hand me your money and leave me alone with those hooligans.",
  "they stole everything.",
  "ah but you are the police.",
  "or is it your duty to only taste the innocence around the world.",
  "oh this around the world in 80 days is a hoax and you know.",
  "it is it mere coincidence.",
  "that he left london the very next day of the robbery.",
  "oh boy more to see.",
  "you are on your robbery.",
