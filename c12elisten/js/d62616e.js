  "p03 SPEAK ENGLISH FLUENTLY.",
  "Hey in English, there is a very simple English rule that every native English speaker learns in middle school, high school, and even college, this simple English rule explains the power of the number three.",
  "You see, when I was in middle school and high school and college, my English teachers always emphasized the importance of providing enough support for my thoughts, ideas, and opinions.",
  "By giving three details, three examples or three reasons.",
  "And this number three is what helps me sound like a native English speaker and speak English.",
  "And today I am going to teach you this simple rule of threes.",
  "Are you ready?.",
  "Well, then I am Teacher Tiffani.",
  "Let's jump right in.",
  "All right.",
  "So the simple rule of threes, we're going to start off with part number one part, one of this rule is the three details part.",
  "You see the first part of this.",
  "Focuses on the important details of the topic, subject or person you are discussing.",
  "In other words, you want to help your listener visualize what you are talking about.",
  "You want to give them more information, which will help them understand, and also help them to realize, wow, you are fluent in English.",
  "So what about a real life situation here?.",
  "We're in this coffee shop.",
  "We see people making coffee.",
  "We see food on the table.",
  "How would we talk about this situation?.",
  "Well, the topic is, tell me about your favorite coffee shop and in response, I could say my favorite coffee shop is Starbucks.",
  "Now here's the truth.",
  "That is a good answer.",
  "I told you what my favorite coffee shop is, but remember we're using the rule of threes, the same rule I learned in school.",
  "So if we're using the rule of threes, how can we give more details?.",
  "So let's check it out.",
  "So we're going back to the coffee shop.",
  "Now, if I give detail number one.",
  "It's very spacious.",
  "That is a fact or a detail.",
  "Detail number two, they sell a wide variety of food and drinks.",
  "Once again, a fact or a detail and detail, number three, they play ambient music.",
  "That is also a fact or a detail.",
  "So you see what's happening.",
  "As soon as I mentioned a wide variety of food and drinks, I mentioned ambient music.",
  "And I said that it's spacious suddenly in the brain, in the mind of the listener, a picture starts to be created.",
  "That is when, again, the listener starts to feel like you're speaking fluently because they can.",
  "So having these details, how would we answer and give a fluent response?.",
  "Here we go.",
  "Speaking English fluently using the three details.",
  "My favorite coffee shop is Starbucks.",
  "The one not too far from my house is very spacious.",
  "There is enough seating in the Starbucks for about 30 to 40 5:00 PM.",
  "It sells a wide variety of food and drinks.",
  "Ah, one other unique thing about Starbucks is that the managers always have ambient music playing in the background.",
  "Now, you know, that response was a fluent English response.",
  "You were able to understand everything I said, and you have a picture in your mind.",
  "Now I want to explain a few words and expressions very quickly.",
  "We have spacious wide variety and ambient.",
  "So very quickly.",
  "I want to explain how to use these words in real life.",
  "Here's what we're going to do that came out fast.",
  "The first one is spacious.",
  "So after me spacious.",
  "Excellent.",
  "One more time.",
  "Spacious.",
  "Very good.",
  "Now this word can be tricky.",
  "I want to remind you too, if you haven't already downloaded the English with Tiffani app, download it now because I have a very good pronunciation course within the app.",
  "You can download it for free right now, and it will help you with pronunciation.",
  "Some words, just like spacious are kind of.",
  "So, what does the word spacious mean?.",
  "This means having or giving enough space or room vast, extensive.",
  "In other words, very large or big.",
  "So I said the coffee shop that's my favorite Starbucks is very spacious.",
  "It's large or big.",
  "We say spacious in English.",
  "Now the next expression that came up right.",
  "Wide variety, wide variety.",
  "So let me explain what this expression means.",
  "It's a group of things that are very different from each other diverse group of things.",
  "So you saw in the video, let me go back and show you from the video.",
  "There were many different types of food and drink being served at the coffee shop.",
  "You see some popcorn, some broccoli, some bread, many different things are available at the coffee shop.",
  "So that is exactly why we used wide variety.",
  "All right.",
  "Okay.",
  "So last time again.",
  "Wide variety.",
  "Excellent.",
  "All right.",
  "Now the last one I want to explain was at the very end.",
  "Ambient.",
  "Good.",
  "Ambient.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Now ambient, this word just means creating a relaxing atmosphere.",
  "Think about it.",
  "When you walk into a coffee shop or a store and they have music playing in the background and all of a sudden.",
  "Whew, you just feel relaxed.",
  "We say they're playing ambient music.",
  "Makes sense.",
  "Right.",
  "Okay.",
  "So again, now using the three details, which is part number one of this three simple rule, we have all of the information we understand now how to give our response and sound like a native English speaker.",
  "This is part one of the rule of threes.",
  "Now I want us to take a look at part number two, part number two, involves three.",
  "Examples.",
  "The second part of this rule focuses on examples of the topic, subject or person you are discussing.",
  "In other words, you want to help your listener understand more by giving them real.",
  "Example situations.",
  "Now this part of the rule of threes is very useful because the person will immediately connect with a real life situation or experience.",
  "So let's say for example, we're looking at this situation, we see a man and it looks like he's trying to lift weights and there's a trainer near him.",
  "So if the topic was.",
  "How are you liking your personal trainer?.",
  "I could give a simple response.",
  "I'll be honest with you.",
  "My personal trainer makes me go hard every workout.",
  "But I really like him.",
  "So again, I've answered the question, but we now need to use the rule of threes.",
  "Part two, giving three examples.",
  "Remember that?.",
  "Number three.",
  "So let's give examples.",
  "Now.",
  "I said that I like him, but he makes me go hard.",
  "Every workout.",
  "The guy said that example, number one.",
  "On the first day of training, he made me do a 45 minute circuit workout that included running squats, weightlifting, and pushups.",
  "Now immediately you can imagine that situation.",
  "Like, whoa!.",
  "That's a lot to do in one workout, giving you a real life example, real life situation.",
  "Now what about example two?.",
  "Ah, when I'm sore, he tells me to push through the pain and then makes me go harder.",
  "Another real life example, and finally example number three.",
  "If I complain, he doubles my workout regimen for the rest of the week.",
  "So now we've organized our thoughts and we have three examples.",
  "Again, the rule of threes, part two is three examples.",
  "So how would we speak fluently using these examples in our response?.",
  "Let's take a look.",
  "Here we go.",
  "If I gave a response for this situation.",
  "I'll be honest with you.",
  "My personal trainer makes me go hard, every workout, but I really like him.",
  "On the first day of training, he made me do a 45 minute circuit workout that included running squats, weightlifting, and push-ups after that workout, my entire body was screaming.",
  "But instead of letting me rest, when I'm sore, he tells me to push through the pain and then makes me go harder.",
  "If I complain he doubles my workout regimen for the rest of the week.",
  "Now, what did you notice?.",
  "Yes.",
  "I gave a fluent English response, but because I showed you how I organized my thoughts, how I was able to come up with this long answer, it makes more sense.",
  "Using the rule of threes.",
  "I gave three simple examples to prove how I feel about my personal trainer or how this man feels about his personal trainer.",
  "Makes sense.",
  "Right?.",
  "Three simple examples.",
  "Now let me explain some of the words that popped up and some of the expressions, the first expression was go hard.",
  "Let me explain what this means.",
  "Go hard.",
  "Now go hard.",
  "Just means to work hard or to do something with intensity.",
  "You're not sitting there.",
  "If you're jumping rope, just relaxing.",
  "No, you're jumping rope really fast.",
  "You are going hard.",
  "It means to put great effort into something.",
  "Usually physical exercise in English, we say, go hard.",
  "Now, the next one in this response.",
  "Circuit workout.",
  "What does that mean?.",
  "Circuit workout.",
  "Now a circuit workout or circuit training is a combination of six or more exercises performed with short rest periods between.",
  "Or either, excuse me for either a set number of repetitions or a prescribed amount of time.",
  "So let me explain.",
  "I have used this when I've worked out at the gym, I would go to the gym, I'd have my jump rope.",
  "I would do pushups, sit ups.",
  "Then I would run in place and then I'd add two other exercises and I would do this in rotation.",
  "In between jumping rope and doing pushups, I would rest for 30 seconds.",
  "This was my circuit workout or my circuit training.",
  "Maybe you enjoy doing circuit workouts when you go to the gym.",
  "All right.",
  "So again, after me circuit workout.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Very good.",
  "Very good.",
  "All right.",
  "Now the next one that popped up was right here.",
  "Body was screaming.",
  "How does your body scream?.",
  "Let me explain.",
  "Let me.",
  "So your body was screaming.",
  "This means that your body is in a lot of pain and extremely sore.",
  "Think about it.",
  "After you work out at the gym, maybe you're working out on the treadmill and you're running hard and then you have to go and lift some weights and your body will start being in excruciating pain.",
  "We can say, whoa.",
  "My body was screaming.",
  "Makes sense, right?.",
  "Again, a natural expression you can use today to sound more natural.",
  "All right.",
  "More like a native English speaker.",
  "Now I have three more.",
  "I want to explain to you these three again, came from the last portion, push through the pain, doubles and regimens.",
  "So let me explain these three to you very quickly.",
  "Push through the pain.",
  "This just means to keep going, even though something hurts, even though your body is screaming, you don't stop.",
  "You keep going.",
  "We say, push through the pain, push through it.",
  "Don't stop.",
  "All right, here's the next one double.",
  "Now this just means to become twice as much or as many, or to make something twice as much, or as many remember in this response right here.",
  "He said, if I complain, he doubles my workout regimen, which means he makes him do twice as much in English.",
  "We say double.",
  "Now, what about this regimen?.",
  "What does regimen mean?.",
  "Regimen is any set of rules about food and exercise that someone follows, especially in order to.",
  "Their health.",
  "It's basically a plan or a schedule.",
  "You follow.",
  "For example, I enjoy food.",
  "As you all know, last week I taught you foodie.",
  "I'm a foodie.",
  "But I also want to stay healthy.",
  "So I eat breakfast at a certain time of the day.",
  "I eat lunch at a certain time of the day and I eat dinner.",
  "Try to eat dinner before 6:00 PM every day.",
  "This is my, I say my food regimen.",
  "What time I eat.",
  "And also what I eat.",
  "I try not to eat lots of sweets.",
  "I try to eat healthier.",
  "So again, my health regimen or the food that I eat, we say regimen in English.",
  "All right.",
  "Okay.",
  "So again, we see our response speaking English fluently using three examples, explaining how his trainer treats him and how his exercise regimen is pretty difficult.",
  "But what about the third part of this very useful rule the rule of threes.",
  "Here's the third part, three reasons.",
  "Now the third part of this rule focuses on giving specific reasons for your ideas on the topic, subject or person you are discussing.",
  "In other words, you want to help your listener understand your thought process and how you developed your idea.",
  "This is a very important part of this.",
  "You know, I've had thousands upon thousands of students during my time as a teacher.",
  "And many of them knew what their idea was.",
  "They had an opinion, but when I asked them why, um, I don't know why teacher, they had a hard time giving me the reasons to support their thoughts or ideas.",
  "But remember what I said earlier, This is a rule that teachers in middle school, high school and college emphasize for native English speakers.",
  "So you must use this rule.",
  "So for that student, for those students, I also tried to emphasize the importance of giving three reasons.",
  "Here we go.",
  "Let's look at a real situation.",
  "We see a mother hugging her daughter.",
  "So the topic would be, do you think it is important for parents to hug their children often?.",
  "Well, my response is simple.",
  "Oh yes.",
  "In my opinion, parents should hug their children multiple times.",
  "Now that literally is my opinion, but I can't stop there.",
  "I need to give reasons, part three of the rule of threes to support my answer.",
  "So here we go, reason.",
  "Number one, a scientific study proved that holding children actually increases brain development.",
  "Reason number two, hugging creates a strong bond between parents and their children.",
  "And finally, reason number three, hugging also helps children know that they are loved, which leads to more self confidence.",
  "Again, my opinion has not changed, but now I have given three reasons to support my opinion, to help you understand how I developed or came to my idea or opinion.",
  "So what would this look like in a fluent English response?.",
  "Here we go.",
  "Yes.",
  "In my opinion, parents should hug their children multiple times a day.",
  "Recently, I read a scientific study.",
  "That proved that holding children actually increases brain development.",
  "On top of that, hugging creates a strong bond between parents and their children.",
  "Finally, hugging also helps children know that they are loved.",
  "Which leads to more self confidence.",
  "So all I did, I used my three reasons.",
  "Again, the same three reasons I showed you underneath my response and these reasons following the rule of threes eventually turned into a fluent English response.",
  "Now you'll see there are three expressions and vocabulary words, and I want to explain them to you very quickly.",
  "The first one is.",
  "Now prove just means to demonstrate or to be the specified thing by evidence or argument to show that something is true.",
  "So in other words, when you say I'm proving something, it just means you're showing the truth of something you're giving a support that will prove something is real.",
  "That will show something is real.",
  "We say, prove in English.",
  "And the other word, the other expression was on top of that.",
  "Look right here.",
  "I said on top of that, hugging creates a strong bond.",
  "Well, when you use on top of that, you're just saying, additionally, furthermore, in addition to something, so I want to add another idea.",
  "Another reason, another point to support my idea.",
  "We say on top of that.",
  "And finally we have this one right here, strong bond again, creates a strong bond between parents and their children.",
  "Well, a strong bond, a bond between people is a strong feeling of friendship, love, or shared beliefs and experiences that unite them.",
  "So we say bond or strong bond in English.",
  "Think about people.",
  "You are connected with people that you love and want to be around.",
  "You have a strong bond with those individuals.",
  "So again, we were able to give a very fluent English response to this topic.",
  "Should parents hug their children using part three of the simple rule of threes, giving the reasons.",
  "So once again, I hope you remember just like my teachers taught me all throughout my school's time.",
  "My school.",
  "Provide enough support for your thoughts, ideas, and opinions by giving three details, three examples or three reasons.",
  "I really hope you enjoyed this week's lesson.",
  "I hope you apply the rule of threes and remember, you can speak English.",
  "All you have to do is learn the rules and learn how to think in English like a native English speaker.",
  "I will see you next week, but as always remember to speak English.",
  "You still there.",
  "You know what time it is?.",
  "It's story time.",
  "I said it's story time.",
  "So today I taught you the rule of threes.",
  "And toward the end, I showed you an example of a mother hugging her child.",
  "So I want to tell you a story about my niece.",
  "Now, many of you have heard me talk about my nieces and how much I love them.",
  "I love being an auntie, but my youngest niece.",
  "So my mom, she actually babysat my youngest.",
  "For about two years from the time she was two years old, all the way up until she was four years old.",
  "So she was at my house every day, every day of the week.",
  "And there's something she did on a regular basis.",
  "As soon as she arrived at our house, again, I would be working in my office.",
  "She would ask my mom.",
  "She called my mom, Gammy, grandma, but Gammy Gammy.",
  "Can I go see TT?.",
  "My mom would say yes.",
  "And she run up the stairs, knock on my door and I'd say, come in.",
  "And she would run to me and give me the biggest hug and kiss.",
  "Now this happened every single day.",
  "From the time she was two years old, all the way up until she was four years old.",
  "Now she's in school.",
  "She's in kindergarten.",
  "pre-K right now.",
  "She's five.",
  "And it created this strong bond between my youngest niece and I, again, I'm close to all of my nieces, but my youngest niece, because every morning in her brain, she was going to get a huge hug, a big hug from her auntie.",
  "She looked forward to it now, fast forward to a few weeks ago.",
  "Now she's five years old.",
  "She doesn't come here every day.",
  "And she had come over to visit with her sister and my sister, well her mom, which is my sister.",
  "And then my brother-in-law, the whole family came over and with her older sister.",
  "So my brother-in-law my sister and the two kids were here and she had come up to my room, gave me a hug, gave me a kiss and she was talking.",
  "And so I said, Hey munchkin, I call her munchkin.",
  "Do you want to go on a walk with TT?.",
  "I needed to go take a walk to take a break from work.",
  "And she immediately said, yes.",
  "I said, okay, let's go.",
  "And she usually says, yes.",
  "Whenever I ask her to go on a walk with me, as we were walking down the stairs to go outside on the walk she said, TT.",
  "I said, yes, munchkin.",
  "I wonder why I always say yes.",
  "Whenever you asked me to go on a walk, I immediately say, yes.",
  "I said, yeah, you do.",
  "And I was just fascinated by this.",
  "Five-year-old thinking logically about the situation, but then she said something.",
  "She said, you know, TT, I guess it's because I love you so much.",
  "And when I say my heart burst, I said, munchkin, I love you too.",
  "And I gave her a big hug.",
  "That moment will forever be imprinted in my mind and on my heart, this five-year-old again for two years straight, every weekday morning would come upstairs, I'd give her the biggest hug and the biggest kiss, and there was a strong bond created so much so that at the age of five, she said, \"TiTi I just love you so much.",
  "So my nieces bring so much joy to me, but I wanted to let you guys know that story because there's a strong bond that was created because of hugs that were given and kisses that were also given.",
  "So if you have someone in your life, your nieces, maybe nephews, or your own children, even your spouse.",
  "Give someone a hug today and let them know how much you love them.",
  "All right, guys.",
  "I hope you enjoyed today's lesson and today's story.",
  "I will see you next week.",
  "Please remember to subscribe.",
  "Remember so that you can also get notifications and don't forget to download the English with Tiffani app.",
  "The link is in the description.",
  "I'll see you guys next week.",
  "Have a good one."
