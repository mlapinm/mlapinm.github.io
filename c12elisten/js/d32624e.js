  "Congratulations Tia!.",
  "I heard our librarian Ms. Peters has asked you to help her.",
  "in the library after school every day.",
  "instead of just the weekend.",
  "And I hear you will get paid for it also.",
  "Thanks Tofu.",
  "But I have politely declined her generous offer.",
  "Why Tia?.",
  "Think of all the money you will get.",
  "You won’t have to rely upon the pocket money.",
  "that mom and dad give you.",
  "You can buy so many things with so much money, Tia.",
  "Yes, thats true Tofu.",
  "But if I spend so much time at the library daily,.",
  "I won't have time to study or to spend with you.",
  "Nobody makes a decision like that Tia.",
  "Well, maybe I am like the Country Mouse.",
  "What did the Country Mouse do?.",
  "Let me tell you.",
  "THE TOWN MOUSE AND THE COUNTRY MOUSE.",
  "Once a Town Mouse visited his cousin.",
  "a Country Mouse for lunch.",
  "Welcome, cousin.",
  "It is so good to see you.",
  "They enjoyed a simple meal of fresh acorn.",
  "wheat stalk and refreshing cold water.",
  "After that the mice sat for hours and told each other stories from their lives.",
  "When it was nighttime.",
  "they slept under the starry sky.",
  "and were awakened by the gentle warmth of the morning sun.",
  "They continued talking over breakfast.",
  "till it was time for the Town Mouse to leave.",
  "Cousin, thank you for the lovely time.",
  "Why don’t you come with me and spend time in the town with me?.",
  "The Country Mouse was so impressed with the stories.",
  "she had heard of the life in the town that she readily agreed.",
  "and left with her cousin.",
  "By the time they reached the Town Mouse’s house in the town.",
  "it was afternoon.",
  "and they were both very hungry.",
  "The Country Mouse smelled lovely aroma of the food left over.",
  "in the dining room.",
  "where humans had just finished their lunch.",
  "The hungry Country Mouse dashed towards it immediately.",
  "when the Town Mouse called out.",
  "Cousin! Watch out for the Cat.",
  "Meow!.",
  "The Country Mouse scurried back to the hole in the wall.",
  "where the Town Mouse’s house was.",
  "Once the cat was gone.",
  "the Country Mouse tried to make its way to the food again.",
  "No, no! Wait for the servants and the House Dog.",
  "The Country Mouse once again rushed back into the hole in the wall.",
  "as it saw a parade of servants followed by the House Dog.",
  "come in and clear the table.",
  "The Country Mouse picked up his hat and bag.",
  "Cousin, I am very happy for your cozy luxurious town life.",
  "But I am happy in my humble country life.",
  "where there may be simple food.",
  "but at least I can enjoy it.",
  "at my will and with security.",
  "And so the Country Mouse returned to her home.",
  "no longer feeling envious of her cousin.",
  "So you see, Tofu.",
  "Ms. Peters might be offering me money,.",
  "but I am happy with my life the way it is.",
  "Oh, Tia! You are the best!.",
  "You always know the right thing to do."
