  "Hey today, I wanna talk about 10 frustrations that English learners, including you experience on a regular basis.",
  "Are you ready?.",
  "Well, then let's jump right in the very first frustration deals with vocabulary.",
  "Now you feel overwhelmed because there are still so many words and expressions that you need to.",
  "Here's the truth.",
  "You do need to learn lots of words and expressions in order to speak English fluently, but you don't need to learn every word nor do you need to learn every expression.",
  "Instead, you need to focus on using what you know.",
  "Putting into practice, applying the words and expressions to your real life.",
  "When you start focusing on using the words and expressions, this frustration will go away.",
  "Why because you'll suddenly start feeling confident in your ability to express yourself, to talk about a situation using what, you know, once you focus on the words, you know, the expressions, you know, you won't worry about the things you don't know, so that when the things you don't know, come.",
  "You'll learn them and you won't feel frustrated.",
  "You'll just feel, ah, wow, amazing.",
  "I have a new word to apply to my life.",
  "So instead of worrying about the words you don't know, focus on applying the words and expressions that you do know, this is how your English will go to the next level.",
  "Now, the second frustration is also a real frustra.",
  "It deals with sentences.",
  "You feel frustrated because you feel like your sentences are still basic.",
  "You know, the feeling right when you are a beginner English learner, you learned the basic sentence structure, but now you're an intermediate English learner.",
  "And you still feel like your sentences are following the basic sentence.",
  "S.",
  "This is very frustrating.",
  "And I know I've spoken to so many students experiencing this frustration, having this frustration right now, along their English journey.",
  "But let me tell you this.",
  "Instead of being frustrated, all you need to do is find a simple method for expanding your English sentence.",
  "I have so many lessons where I explain how you can use the five W's method to expand your sentences.",
  "Who, what, when, where, and why following this simple method, you can start expanding your sentences and no longer will you be frustrated.",
  "So instead of being frustrated, getting upset because you don't think your sentences can get longer, use the simple methods that I'm teaching you and use those methods to expand your sentences and you won't be frustrated anymore.",
  "Listen.",
  "I've used these methods with thousands upon thousands of students.",
  "And I've watched them suddenly realized, oh my goodness, Tiffani, I, I can expand my sentences and they get the confidence.",
  "They need to speak English fluently and you can experience the same thing.",
  "Now the third frustration is something that many English learners also experience.",
  "And it deals with speaking.",
  "You are not able to speak for longer than 30 to 60 seconds in English without pausing or feeling stuck.",
  "I remember when I was in Korea, I'd have to interview students to see if they could go to the next.",
  "And the students spoke quite well, but I would ask them a question and sometimes they would listen to the question, pause, and they'd start to answer.",
  "But then after about 20 seconds, they would stop.",
  "Look around and say, I'm done teacher.",
  "And at that moment I would realize, ah, they haven't learned the tips and the, and the skills they need to speak English for a longer period of time.",
  "They haven't learned how to speak English fluently just yet.",
  "They're understanding.",
  "Good.",
  "They're able to answer questions at the beginner or intermediate level, but they're not an advanced English speaker just yet.",
  "So for you not being able to speak for longer than 30 to 60 seconds, all you need to do, you have to learn the tips that will help you speak English fluently.",
  "I mentioned to, in order for you to overcome the previous frustration, you need to use the five W's.",
  "Well, in order for you to speak for a longer period of time, you have to follow the tips I've been giving you.",
  "Give three details, three reasons, three examples.",
  "Talk about your personal experience.",
  "So there are ways to overcome these frustrations.",
  "You can speak English fluently, like a native English speaker.",
  "All you have to do though, is learn the tips and skills that native English speakers use in order to speak English fluent.",
  "That literally is all it is.",
  "You are intelligent, you're smart.",
  "You're learning another language.",
  "So your brain, no problem with your brain at.",
  "You simply need to learn what native English speakers learn and follow the patterns that we use when we speak in English.",
  "So you wanna improve your speaking follow the patterns used by native English speakers, three details, three examples, three reasons, and talking.",
  "Your personal experiences.",
  "Now the fourth frustration is another one that maybe you have experienced, or maybe you're experiencing right now.",
  "It deals with pronunciation.",
  "Now you still struggle with certain aspects of your English pronunciation.",
  "Listen, English is a tricky language and pronouncing certain sounds might be more difficult for you because of your native language.",
  "For example, if your native language is French, there might be some sounds in English that are a little trickier for you to pronounce properly.",
  "If your native language is Korean, you may struggle with the F sound or the T sound th putting your tongue through your teeth.",
  "So sometimes there are certain aspects of English pronunciation that really frustrate you.",
  "Let me tell you this, in order for you to improve your pronunciation and overcome this frustration, you simply need to listen to more native English speakers as they speak English.",
  "You heard me, right?.",
  "Your brain is amazing.",
  "Just like when you were a.",
  "You listen to your parents, you listen to your siblings, you listen to people around you, and you started to pronounce words based on what you heard.",
  "So the more you listen to native English speakers, the more you observe, the way they speak, watching their mouth and looking at how their tongue is positioned, the better.",
  "And excuse me, the more your pronunciation will improve.",
  "I'm gonna leave that in there.",
  "so.",
  "The more you watch native English speakers, the more your pronunciation will improve.",
  "So you have to watch native English speakers.",
  "You have to listen to real English conversations, and then your pronunciation will improve just by mimicking them and copying them.",
  "And you will eventually speak English with more fluency.",
  "Now this fifth frustration deals with comprehen.",
  "You feel discouraged when you watch movies or dramas and you don't understand simple words or scenes.",
  "This happens all the time.",
  "I have students and their English is really good, but they'll watch an American movie or they'll watch an American TV show or a sitcom.",
  "And they'll say, Tiffani.",
  "I don't understand what they're saying.",
  "I don't think the words they're using are difficult, but why can't I understand what they're saying, TIFF, I don't comprehend what they're saying.",
  "And the students get frustrated.",
  "You see, as you're progressing from an intermediate English learner to an advanced English learner, you want to speak English fluently.",
  "You want to sound like a native English speaker.",
  "Well, in order to sound like a native English speaker, once again, you have to pay attention to the way native English speakers speak.",
  "That's not done with the book that's not done with a book you can buy from the store.",
  "No, you actually have to watch more conversations.",
  "The more you observe, the better your comprehension will.",
  "You'll understand more about what's going on.",
  "You'll watch body language and you'll stop being so frustrated because you are actually focusing on the right things.",
  "You're understanding how native English speakers actually speak and you're learning what they use in real life.",
  "Now, let me explain something to you.",
  "What's happening right now is I'm teaching you how to get over these frustrations and finally sound like a native English.",
  "But before I continue with the next one, I wanna explain something.",
  "I wanna help you sound like.",
  "I want you to speak English fluently, like a native English speaker.",
  "So if that is your goal, if you wanna follow my simple plan, I have a simple five step plan that will help you sound like a native English speaker.",
  "All you have to do is go to www.englishfluencyplanenglishfluencyplan.com.",
  "Simple five steps.",
  "These five steps will help you start sounding like me.",
  "You'll comprehend what native English speakers are saying.",
  "You'll be able to improve your vocabulary.",
  "There will be so many things that will improve and help you speak English like a native English speaker.",
  "By following this plan, go to www.englishfluencyplan.com or hit the link in the description.",
  "Now let's go back to the sixth frustration.",
  "This deals with thinking.",
  "Now you still have a hard time organizing your thoughts in English.",
  "You have a tendency.",
  "Think in your own language, this happens.",
  "And I know it's frustrating.",
  "You're probably looking at the screen right now saying yes, Tiffani, this happens all the time.",
  "Well, the only reason this happens is because you have not given yourself the tools.",
  "Your brain needs to start thinking in English.",
  "You need to organize, you have thoughts already in your mind, but they're in your native language.",
  "Now you need to change those thoughts to English thoughts.",
  "And the only way that can happen is when you're thinking about a certain topic, you have different compartments.",
  "You have the five W's compartment, the details compartment.",
  "The reasons, the experiences, the examples you have to organize these things in your brain based on a topic.",
  "Again, this is how native English speaker.",
  "Think we literally have compartments in our brain for each topic.",
  "I can tell you a story about food.",
  "I can tell you details, reasons, examples related to any topic you bring to me because I've practiced this so long and you can do the same thing.",
  "So instead of being frustrated about how to think in English, all you have to do is learn how to put these compartments in your brain about any.",
  "These are the things I want to help you with.",
  "I want you to speak English fluently now.",
  "Challenge number seven.",
  "This frustra.",
  "Comprehension versus speaking, you can understand me others better, but you still don't know how to speak better English.",
  "You can understand better, but you're not able to express yourself.",
  "You're not able to speak in the way that the people are speaking, that you're listening.",
  "This comes with practice and it goes back to frustration.",
  "Number six, thinking in English, I'm glad you're comprehending, but now you wanna express yourself.",
  "You simply need to learn how to take your thoughts and bring them out.",
  "Following a simple plan.",
  "Following a simple step by step guide that helps you organize your thoughts in the way that negative English speakers organize our thoughts and then causing those thoughts to come out in the same way that we actually express ourselves experiences, details, reasons, personal opinions.",
  "These are different pillars of English fluency.",
  "And once you understand them, you'll no longer be frustrated because you'll understand.",
  "And you'll also speak well.",
  "No longer being frustrated, frustration, number eight deals with memorizing.",
  "Now you don't want to memorize words every day, but you still want to learn more important or some important and natural English words.",
  "This is true.",
  "You have to learn new words.",
  "You have to learn new expressions, but there's gonna come a time, which is right now, you can no longer just memorize words.",
  "You have to learn them in real situations, from real conversations between native English speakers, because this is how little children learn.",
  "They don't have books, they can't read yet, but they learn by observing what people are saying.",
  "Observing body language.",
  "Oh, when I'm happy, I use this word when I'm sad, I use this word.",
  "You have to learn the exact same way in order for you to speak English fluently and stop being frustrated.",
  "Don't worry about the books.",
  "You have to learn new words and expressions, but learn them from real conversations.",
  "This is all a part of the five steps I use for my students, the English fluency plan.com, where I teach students how to observe real conversations between native English speakers.",
  "Hear the words that are used and the expressions that are used, and then start using them in real.",
  "Practice using them and then start using them.",
  "This is how you learn at your level right now.",
  "Stop memorizing the frustration that comes from just sitting down and memorizing over and over and over again, without using the words or expressions, that frustration is real.",
  "And I felt the same frustration when I was studying Korean until I developed this five step plan for fluency that helped me start speaking Korean fluently by observing real conversations between native speaker.",
  "Now this next frustration is also one that I'm sure you've experienced before study time, you feel like quitting because you have been studying English for so long.",
  "Maybe you've been studying English for.",
  "Years or decades.",
  "And you just feel like you're not getting to the next level.",
  "You feel like you've hit this ceiling, right?.",
  "Well, I'll be honest with you.",
  "You have, again, I experienced the same thing.",
  "I hit a ceiling when I was studying Korean.",
  "I couldn't seem to go above the ceiling until I started following and developing this five step fluency plan.",
  "You see, I realized in order for me to go to the next.",
  "Again, I couldn't study the same way I had been studying you can't study the same way you've been studying in order to get to the next step in order to get to the next level, you have to study in a different way.",
  "This studying requires you to observe real conversations between native English speakers.",
  "So no longer will you be frustrated and wanna quit because every time you start studying, You'll be interested in the conversation topic, you'll learn new words and expressions naturally you'll understand how to express yourself like a native English speaker.",
  "So this frustration will go away because instead of feeling like you're sitting there studying and it's boring, there'll be an excitement.",
  "Again, I experienced the same thing when I started studying Korean in this way.",
  "So this frustration will go away.",
  "Now, this last frustra.",
  "Number 10 study partner.",
  "You don't have anyone else around you to practice what you are learning.",
  "That is frustrating.",
  "It really is.",
  "Trust me.",
  "I know I'm here in America and there aren't too many Koreans around me, so I can't practice as often as I'd like to.",
  "And because I'm in this situation, I realize that you as an English learner are probably in the exact same situ.",
  "Well, in order for you to improve, you have to study with someone, but that doesn't mean that person has to physically be in your country.",
  "You see the beauty of online, lets you study with other individuals around the world.",
  "So this is what I developed.",
  "I realized that I wanted you to really speak English fluently, but you needed a.",
  "So this plan that I have put together, this five step plan also includes study partners.",
  "There are people from all around the world.",
  "I have students that have followed this plan and no longer are they frustrated.",
  "Why?.",
  "Because every week they're able to practice with students from around the world and improve their English.",
  "One guy he's been with me and he's followed this five step plan.",
  "Now he is able, and I'm not even kidding.",
  "You.",
  "He is able to speak for an hour by himself, in English, with minimal mistakes and with confidence because he followed this five step plan.",
  "He's confident in his abilities, he's able to express himself so much so that he's shocked himself.",
  "This is a real situation.",
  "I was so proud of him.",
  "I watched him, we had a class together and something happened to where my camera went off and it was just him on the screen.",
  "And for almost an hour, he spoke in English, encouraging and inspiring other English students.",
  "Now, my camera never came back on.",
  "So all I could do was watch him.",
  "He's been with me for how long, two and a half years.",
  "And to see his growth made me smile.",
  "Like I was a mother.",
  "I was so proud of him.",
  "And I want you to experience the same thing because he's no longer frustrated at all.",
  "He has to be, to study with.",
  "He has to be to practice with, and his English.",
  "Oh, my goodness.",
  "Now he does business with other native English speakers.",
  "Now his business is growing because his English has improved and I want you to experience the same thing.",
  "So instead of being frustrated, all you have to do is follow a simple five step plan that will take you to English fluency and remove all of these frustrations.",
  "So again, I hope this lesson helped to you understand that these frustrations are real, but you don't have to experience them anymore.",

  "That God links people for a purpose.",
