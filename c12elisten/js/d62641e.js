  "Hi guys.",
  "Welcome back to English with Max.",
  "In this video we're going to look at some advanced vocabulary.",
  "These aren't strange or obscure words (most high school students who are native speakers would know these words), but they're words that non-natives often don't learn.",
  "If you know all or most of these words, then you probably have a C2 level, at least in terms of comprehension.",
  "If you don't know these words, don't fret (that's also a good word) because this is a good opportunity to perhaps add some more interesting verbs to your vocabulary.",
  "Oh and \"don't fret\" simply means don't be unhappy or worried.",
  "Now if you're really interested in improving your vocabulary, you might like to sign up for my free advancedEenglish email lessons.",
  "I send them out every two weeks and you can unsubscribe at any time.",
  "I'll put the link in the description.",
  "If you're interested in improving your grammar, remember that I also have a video course on Udemy which covers 55 very common mistakes made by non-native speakers.",
  "If you'd like to receive my special discount for that, you'll also find the link in the description.",
  "And just one more thing before we start.",
  "Frank - that's frank - would also be really happy if you followed us on social media.",
  "I have Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.",
  "If you want to hear Frank talk, you'll find some videos on those platforms.",
  "Okay and now the verbs.",
  "Yes, this video is just on verbs.",
  "I've sort of divided them into categories and then there are a few miscellaneous ones at the end.",
  "This first group is all to do with breaking the law.",
  "These ones are actually all to do with financial crime.",
  "Number one: to defraud.",
  "To defraud means to take money or goods from a person or organisation illegally.",
  "For example: He was found guilty of defrauding his business partner of thousands of dollars.",
  "Naughty, naughty.",
  "And now we have to embezzle.",
  "To embezzle means to secretly and illegally take money from the place where you work.",
  "Normally it's used for people who are in positions of power and are in control of large sums of money.",
  "The company's managers went to prison after they embezzled more than a million pounds.",
  "Number three is extort.",
  "To extort means to illegally force somebody to give you something (usually money) by using threats.",
  "For example: The gang has been extorting money from local business owners for years.",
  "And now we have to swindle.",
  "Swindle is very similar to defraud.",
  "It means to get money from somebody by deceiving them.",
  "This is a little informal, so you might hear it on the news, but it probably wouldn't be used in a courtroom.",
  "The company swindled their investors out of millions of dollars.",
  "And now we have some words related to conflict.",
  "The first one is to badmouth.",
  "This is an informal word and it means to criticise somebody or something in a very unpleasant way.",
  "She got fired for badmouthing the company in public.",
  "Jack acts like her best friend, but he badmouths her behind her back.",
  "And now we have to bicker.",
  "To bicker means to argue, especially about things that aren't very important.",
  "It isn't as strong as to fight.",
  "Bickering is basically just silly arguing.",
  "My grandparents love each other, but they're always bickering.",
  "The party members frequently bicker amongst themselves.",
  "A synonym of bicker is squabble This basically means the same thing as bicker.",
  "It's perhaps just a little bit stronger.",
  "People might make a bit more noise, for example, when they squabble.",
  "Here's an example sentence: That tennis player is always squabbling with the umpire.",
  "Now some people after they bicker or squabble with somebody aren't very happy, and if they're not very happy, they might sulk.",
  "To sulk means to be angrily silent.",
  "If a person sulks, they might refuse to be friendly or not want to talk to anybody.",
  "After I told Frank to behave better, he sulked in his room for a couple of hours.",
  "And now let's look at some movement verbs.",
  "The first one is to amble.",
  "To amble means to walk slowly in a relaxed way.",
  "For example: She ambled along the path without a care in the world.",
  "The next one is to dawdle.",
  "Yes, I know that sounds a bit funny.",
  "Anyway, to dawdle means to walk slowly or to take more time than necessary to do something.",
  "It's used in a disapproving way.",
  "A parent might say to their children: Stop dawdling.",
  "You'll be late for school.",
  "Or if you're going to a party with some friends and you're walking there and some friends are walking very slowly behind you, you might say to them: Guys, please don't dawdle.",
  "The party has already started.",
  "And now we have to hover.",
  "This has a few meanings, but I'll just give you the two main ones.",
  "Firstly, it can mean to stay in the one place in the air.",
  "It's used for things like birds, insects or helicopters.",
  "For example: When we eat outside, there are always flies hovering around us.",
  "You can also say \"to hover above\". For example: The helicopter hovered above the lake.",
  "It can also be used for people.",
  "In that case it means to stand around the same place, usually because you're waiting for something or you're not sure what to do.",
  "For example, you could say: I appreciate good service, but I don't like it when waiters hover around my table.",
  "And now we have to linger.",
  "This is similar to hover, but they're not exactly the same.",
  "This means to take longer than usual to leave or disappear.",
  "I don't like eating raw onions because the taste always lingers in my mouth.",
  "After the conference, Frank lingered in the dining area to make the most of the leftover food.",
  "And now to stroll.",
  "Stroll is a synonym of amble.",
  "It means to walk in a slow and relaxed way, but normally it's done for pleasure.",
  "For example: We decided to stroll along the beach after the meal.",
  "The last one in this section is to strut.",
  "To strut means to walk in a proud way trying to look important.",
  "We use this in a disapproving way.",
  "For example: The manager's son strutted around the office as if he owned the place.",
  "And now we have a few ways of speaking.",
  "The first one is to mumble.",
  "This is actually one of my bad habits - in real life, in any case.",
  "I try not to do it in my videos.",
  "To mumble means to speak quietly and in an unclear way.",
  "Normally it happens when people don't open their mouths wide enough.",
  "For example: I only understood half of what she said because she was mumbling.",
  "Next we have to mutter.",
  "This is very similar to mumble, but people normally mutter if they are angry or annoyed.",
  "It looks something like this: (muttering) Yeah, maybe that's an exaggeration, but that's basically it.",
  "It's like mumbling when you're not very happy about something.",
  "For example: After the argument he muttered something to himself and left.",
  "And now to shriek.",
  "This has two main meanings.",
  "Firstly it can mean to make a loud, high-pitched sound.",
  "It could be because the person is scared or in pain, but it could also be because the person is excited, so it might be for a positive reason.",
  "For example: The kids shrieked with joy when they found out they were going to Disneyland.",
  "I'm not going to imitate it because if you're listening to this with headphones, it might not be very pleasant.",
  "It can also mean to say something in a loud, high-pitched voice.",
  "For example: When the burglar entered her home, she shrieked, Get out of my house!\" And now a few random ones before we finish.",
  "The first one is to backfire.",
  "This has two main meanings.",
  "Firstly it can be used to talk about an engine.",
  "It's when an engine makes a sudden, loud sound because it's not working properly.",
  "I don't actually know how it works because, frankly, I don't care that much about those types of things, but I'm sure we've all heard a car or a truck backfire.",
  "It's a really loud \"bang\" sound.",
  "Here's an example sentence: We all got a fright when a car in the street backfired.",
  "Secondly, it can be used to talk about plans or actions.",
  "It means to have the opposite effect of the one intended.",
  "He tried to make himself more desirable to his girlfriend by flirting with other people, but the plan backfired and she dumped him.",
  "To dump means to break up with somebody.",
  "The next one is to grin.",
  "To grin means to smile widely, especially in amusement, so if you find something funny.",
  "For example: I was suspicious when I saw Frank grinning this morning.",
  "The thing is, sometimes people grin just if they're happy or if they find something funny, but sometimes people grin if they've done something a bit naughty.",
  "And finally we have to milk.",
  "I'm sure you know the noun \"milk\", but it can be a verb as well.",
  "This has two main meanings.",
  "Firstly it can mean to take milk from an animal, such as a cow or a goat.",
  "So if you're doing it manually, it looks something like this.",
  "It's also an informal word meaning to get as much as you can from a situation or a person, usually in an unfair or dishonest way.",
  "It's similar to take advantage of or exploit.",
  "For example: The company is milking their clients for even more money.",
  "That's it, guys.",
  "I hope you found this useful.",
  "As I said in the beginning, if you know all of these words, then you probably have a very advanced vocabulary.",
  "If you didn't know these words, like I said, this is a good opportunity to add some new words to your vocabulary.",
  "And now a little bit of homework.",
  "I encourage you to take one of these words and use it in a sentence in the comments.",
  "I will try to correct it for you.",
  "Thanks very much for watching.",
  "I'll see you next time.",
  "For example... Excuse me.",
  "There's a dog barking.",
  "I don't really... To mutter...",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MRpFzL5LbQ&list=PLUqdObbmu1AHG8Fv2m_89KKA-JMns7LhJ&index=14\">I don't really... To mutter...</a>",
  "Hi everyone, in this video we're going to look at some very common English proverbs.",
  "A proverb is a short statement that gives advice or expresses a belief that many people think is true.",
  "Most expressions that are considered proverbs have existed for quite a long time.",
  "Before we start, remember that you can also follow me on social media, and if you're interested in signing up for my free advanced English email lessons, you'll find the link in the description.",
  "The first one is: Beggars can't be choosers.",
  "A beggar is a poor person who asks people for money or food, normally in the street.",
  "\"Chooser\" isn't actually a very common word, but I think the meaning is quite obvious.",
  "It's simply a person who chooses something.",
  "People say this if they recognise that they need to accept something, because it is the only option available to them.",
  "It's when somebody isn't in a position to be fussy.",
  "For example, if somebody is really desperate for a job, they might say: The job isn't very well paid, but I accepted it because beggars can't be choosers.",
  "Another example: This isn't my dream car, but it's all I can afford, and beggars can't be choosers.",
  "The second one is: The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.",
  "This is sometimes shortened to: The grass is always greener on the other side.",
  "And most of the time we shorten it even more and we just say: The grass is always greener.",
  "This means that a different situation might seem better than the one you're currently in, but it probably isn't better.",
  "And here's a visual representation.",
  "This cow seems to think that the grass on the other side of the barbed wire fence is better than the grass on its side.",
  "For example, you might say: I wish I had Mary's job.",
  "She's always travelling so much.",
  "And then someone could say to you: Yes, but her job's probably quite stressful and she may wish she had a job similar to yours.",
  "The grass is always greener The next one is: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
  "Here \"ain't\" means \"is not\". Another thing to be aware of is that \"broke\" in this sentence is grammatically incorrect.",
  "It should be \"broken\", but in this proverb we always say \"broke\". So this sentence means: If it isn't broken, don't fix it.",
  "This means that if something is working well, there is no need to change it.",
  "For example, in a workplace someone could say: Why is the new manager changing everything?.",
  "The old systems worked just fine.",
  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
  "I don't know about you, but I sometimes have this feeling with computer programs or websites when they make unnecessary updates.",
  "Like Skype, for example.",
  "They keep changing things and it's annoying.",
  "And now we have: A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.",
  "This apparently comes from a Chinese proverb.",
  "I think the meaning is quite obvious.",
  "It means that even big, overwhelming tasks have a starting point.",
  "It's often used to encourage people who are afraid of starting something because it's overwhelming.",
  "It's a bit like saying: You need to start somewhere.",
  "Or: Just start by doing something small.",
  "For example, if somebody wants to learn a language and they're scared to start, you could say: Well, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.",
  "You could start by watching YouTube videos for beginners, or looking for a teacher, or learning some basic grammar.",
  "I think you get the idea.",
  "This one is: People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.",
  "You can also say: People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.",
  "This basically means don't be a hypocrite.",
  "In other words, you shouldn't criticise people for having faults that you have or for doing things that you do.",
  "Sometimes we shorten this and we just say something like: Well, people in glass houses.",
  "Or we might say: You know what they say about people in glass houses.",
  "For example, if Frank says that Ethel was drinking too much at the party, I could say to him: Well, Frank, you know what they say about people in glass houses.",
  "The next one is: Practice make perfect.",
  "I think the meaning of this is pretty obvious.",
  "It simply means the more you practise something, the better you will get.",
  "It doesn't mean you'll learn to do something 100% perfectly.",
  "For example, nobody, not even native speakers, speak a language perfectly because everybody makes mistakes sometimes, but generally speaking, if you practise something, you will become better at it.",
  "If Frank is complaining because he keeps falling off his skateboard, I could say: Well, Frank, practice makes perfect.",
  "Or if George says that he finds it hard to ignore marketing people in the street, I could say: Well, George, practice makes perfect.",
  "George is a bit too polite sometimes.",
  "And now we have: Time is money.",
  "This means that time is a valuable resource, so we shouldn't waste it.",
  "People usually say it if they want somebody to hurry up, particularly in a business context.",
  "For example, if you're at work and you're mucking around with your colleagues, your boss might come by and say: Come on, guys.",
  "Time is money.",
  "This one is: Two heads are better than one.",
  "This means that two people working together to solve a problem will be more effective than one person working alone.",
  "For example, if you're looking at a financial document and it's a bit confusing, you might say to a family member: I don't really understand this.",
  "Could you have a look at it with me?.",
  "Two heads are better than one.",
  "I think this statement's true.",
  "Except if it's a university group assignment.",
  "Then you should just do it yourself.",
  "The next one is: Waste not, want not.",
  "This one means that if you don't waste things, you will always have enough.",
  "Here \"want\" actually means \"lack\". It's a little formal and old-fashioned to use \"want\" like this, but people sometimes still use it that way.",
  "So this proverb means if you're not wasteful, you won't lack things.",
  "For example, you could say: I always save leftover food for later because waste not, want not.",
  "Obviously if you're not frequently throwing away food, you will save money.",
  "It's also better for the environment.",
  "The next one is: A watched pot never boils.",
  "This one is essentially about impatience.",
  "You know how sometimes you might put some water in a pot and then put it on the stove, and you need to wait for the water to boil before you can put food in it?.",
  "So you stand there watching it and it seems to take forever?.",
  "Well, that's the idea in this proverb.",
  "It means that if you're impatient for something to happen, it will seem to take longer.",
  "Something that I think a lot of people can relate to is sending a message to somebody who you're interested in romantically.",
  "You might then check your phone constantly to see if they've replied.",
  "If you're doing that, someone might say to you: A watched pot never boils.",
  "This one is: Where there's smoke there's fire.",
  "This means that if something bad is being said about something or someone, or if rumours are being spread, there's probably an element of truth there.",
  "It might not be entirely true, but it's probably partly true.",
  "For example, if there's a rumour going around that Frank caused some arguments in a bar and he says that none of it happened, I could say: Well, Frank, where there's smoke there's fire.",
  "The last one is: You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.",
  "This one means that you can give somebody the opportunity to do something, but you can't force them to do it if they don't want to.",
  "Normally we just say: You can only lead a horse to water.",
  "Sometimes teachers think this when they're in a classroom.",
  "For example, if you give your students very simple homework or if you make suggestions on how they could perhaps improve their skills, and then they don't do it, you could say: You can only lead a horse to water.",
  "I hope you're not one of those students.",
  "Another example is if somebody hosts a party with food, and they put out knives and forks, but then people like me just eat with their fingers, that person could say: You can only lead a horse to water.",
  "I hope you found that helpful.",
  "I hope you learned something.",
  "If you did, please hit the thumbs up.",
  "Let me know in the comments if any of these proverbs exist in your language, or if there are any close equivalents.",
  "Thanks very much for watching, guys.",
  "I'll see you next time."
