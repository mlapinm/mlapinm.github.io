  "maybe she knew a way that the mermaid could be with the prince.",
  "yes there is a way.",
  "i can send you to the land above the sea.",
  "you will lose your fishtail and have legs.",
  "if by the second sunset you can get the prince to love you more than he loves his parents.",
  "then you can be with him forever.",
  "Otherwise you will die and become foam in the sea.",
  "but in return you must give me your voice.",
  "but without my voice how will i make the prince fall in love with me.",
  "you still have your pretty face and eyes.",
  "will also be the most beautiful dancer anyone has ever seen.",

  "but all of them had very short hair now instead of the long flowing locks they used to have earlier.",
  "sisters what are you doing here.",
  "we have come to save you.",
  "we went to the witch.",
  "in exchange of our hair she gave us this knife.",
  "if you stab the prince through his heart before sunset you can be saved.",
  "handing the knife to the youngest sister.",
