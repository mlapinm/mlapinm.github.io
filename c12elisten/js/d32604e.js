  "Hello! Tofu?.",
  "Hi Tia!.",
  "Tofu, I need your help.",
  "I am at school and I'm gonna stay here too late, for the drama club.",
  "Will you please go over to Mrs. John’s house and water her plants for her.",
  "and feed her fish?.",
  "Oh no, Tia!.",
  "I don’t want to.",
  "I’ve just made fresh popcorn for myself and I want to watch some TV at home.",
  "You don’t have to go right away, Tofu.",
  "You can go after your popcorn is over.",
  "Okay.",
  "Hi Tofu.",
  "Was everything okay at Mrs John’s?.",
  "Mrs John’s? Oh! I didn’t go.",
  "I didn’t feel like it.",
  "Tofu! How could you?.",
  "You told me that you will go.",
  "Yes...but why do I have to do your work, Tia?.",
  "Let me tell you why.",
  "Once upon a time a Little Prince lived alone on a comet.",
  "The comet was his home and he took care of it.",
  "Every day he cleaned the volcanoes.",
  "and trimmed the tree roots.",
  "One day a seed fell on his comet and grew into a flower.",
  "You are so beautiful.",
  "I will always take care of you and protect you.",
  "And I will call you Rose.",
  "Thank you!.",
  "From then on Rose and the Prince would always spend their time together.",
  "But as time went by.",
  "the Prince stopped liking the fact that Rose always wanted his attention and care.",
  "He could not understand why she behaved like that.",
  "He started feeling.",
  "he should make more friends.",
  "And so, he left Rose behind and went around the Universe to make more friends.",
  "He stopped at the first planet that came his way.",
  "A King lived alone on that planet.",
  "I am so happy that you came here.",
  "Now, I have someone to rule over!.",
  "And so, the King started ordering the Little Prince around.",
  "The Little Prince was not used to it.",
  "Nobody ever spoke to him like that.",
  "Friends don’t order friends around.",
  "I must leave this planet and find another friend.",
  "The Prince left the King’s planet and came to another planet.",
  "Here he met a very well-dressed man.",
  "The man lived alone on the planet.",
  "Welcome, Little Prince.",
  "I am happy that you have come to my planet.",
  "Now, I have someone who can admire me!.",
  "And so, the man kept asking the Prince for compliments for everything.",
  "When the Prince wouldn’t admire him or praise him for his actions.",
  "he would get upset with the Prince.",
  "Friends cannot like each other just because of compliments.",
  "There must be more to friendship!.",
  "I must leave this planet and go find another friend.",
  "The Prince left the second planet and arrived on the third one.",
  "where he met an old man who had a lot of books.",
  "What are all these books?.",
  "I am a geographer.",
  "I write about the seas, hills, mountains and plains.",
  "Tell me about your planet and I will write about it.",
  "Can you write about Rose and me?.",
  "I only write about things that last forever.",
  "Hence, I cannot write about you two.",
  "The Prince felt sad that he and Rose were not eternal.",
  "He felt that the Geographer did not care much about him and his friend.",
  "and so, he left this planet too.",
  "and arrived on one called Earth.",
  "There he met a fox.",
  "Will you be my friend?.",
  "You must tame me first.",
  "Tame?.",
  "What is that?.",
  "It is where you create a bond with me.",
  "you care for me and we connect with each other.",
  "Otherwise, you are just a boy to me like million others and I am just a fox to you.",
  "The boy understood that that is what Rose had been doing!.",
  "She was taming me! She was making bonds with me.",
  "I have made a mistake! I must go back home to my Rose.",
  "The Prince immediately returned home.",
  "There he found Rose and hugged her tight.",
  "I will always be with you! I am responsible!.",
  "I am sorry, Tia. I did not respect our bonds.",
  "You always take care of me.",
  "I could have done this for you.",
  "Its okay, Tofu.",
  "I will go there now and we’ll have dinner together.",
  "Okay.",
  "Oh, wait! I’ll also come with you and help you.",
  "Okay! Let’s go together!."
