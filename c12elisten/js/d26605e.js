  "once upon a time in a peaceful village there were two couples who were neighbors but they lived in opposite conditions.",
  "roger may live in wealth with the spacious beautiful house.",
  "in contrast their neighbor curtis and his wife alva lived a humble life in a simple small wooden house.",
  "although they were poor and didn't have much money.",
  "curtis and alva were always happy and their house was always filled with laughter.",
  "they were very kind and often helped those in need.",
  "that's why people really like them.",
  "roger and may who lived in a spacious house and had a lot of money were very stingy.",
  "therefore they barely laughed but usually argued love instead.",
  "because they were rich they al ways looked down on the poor around them.",
  "they often themselves and made fun of everyone including their kind neighbors.",
  "keep helping people you won't even have enough to eat.",
  "one day when it was getting dark an all-exhausted traveler walked towards the two houses.",
  "seeing a big beautiful house he went to knock on the door.",
  "when mesa wrapped old man she looked very annoyed.",
  "who are you what do you want from us.",
  "i just passed by your house and it is dark now.",
  "could you please kindly let me sleep here for one night.",
  "looking at the poor dirty old man with wrapped clothes may looked at him in contempt.",
  "at that moment roger also walked to the door.",
  "who knocked on our door at this hour.",
  "a filthy poor man who wants to stay here for one night.",
  "well if we let everyone sleep over i will become a dad and live on the street.",
  "well you should go somewhere else to ask.",
  "then roger slammed the door leaving the old man standing outside in the cold.",
  "the old man was too tired and sad he had to knock on the door of curtis house.",
  "oh hi sir what are you doing around here so late at night.",
  "i just passed by your house and it's dark now.",
  "could you please kindly let me sleep here for one night.",
  "oh if you don't mind my small house please come  in.",
  "alva quickly took the old man into the house.",
  "curtis noticed that the old man was cold.",
  "so the couple burned more firewood and served warm rice to the old man.",
  "while the old man was eating the kind couple discussed.",
  "he must have traveled a long way to be here poor him.",
  "we should let him sleep on the bed and we can sleep on some straw by the fire.",
  "okay let's do what you suggested.",
  "the couple let the old man sleep on the warm bed in the room.",
  "and they spread straw to sleep near the fireplace.",
  "the next morning the old man woke up early.",
  "as soon as he walked out of the room.",
  "a delicious breakfast was already prepared by curtis and his wife.",
  "they had a nice breakfast together.",
  "after eating the old men said goodbye to them and left.",
  "thank you so much you too was so kind to me.",
  "i will give you three wishes you can wish for anything.",
  "you're so funny.",
  "how could we be that much fortunate.",
  "why don't you just try whistling for something.",
  "curtis and alva did not believe the old man but they did not want to make him sad so they immediately thought of three wishes.",
  "if possible we wish we could stay healthy for the rest of our life.",
  "and always have enough food to eat.",
  "and i wish we had a new house instead of this one.",
  "all right your wishes will come true immediately.",
  "suddenly some magical lights flew around the house.",
  "immediately the small wooden house turned into a beautiful house that was even bigger than their neighbors.",
  "inside there was a lot of gold and silver.",
  "the poor old man was actually a god.",
  "he just wanted to test the couple's kindness and granted them three wishes.",
  "roger and may woke up when it was almost noon.",
  "as soon as they stepped out of the house they were shocked to find their neighbors no longer had a small shabby house instead it was a much better one compared to theirs.",
  "they hurried to curtis and alva's house to ask them alva and her husband told them the full story.",
  "roger and may regretted not letting the men stay with them.",
  "may blamed her husband.",
  "it was your fault if you had let the old man sleep over we would have had three wishes.",
  "you also complained that he was poor and filthy now you're blaming me.",
  "that's enough now you should ride the horse and chase after him.",
  "talk to him gently invite him to our home and ask him for three wishes.",
  "hurry up.",
  "roger complained to his wife but then quickly jumped on the horse to chase after the old man.",

  "roger finally saw the old man walking in front of him.",
  "he happily rode the horse to the old man.",
  "sir please give me a minute.",
  "um my wife forced me to chase you away.",

  "please come back to my house.",
  "you can stay as long as you want.",
  "okay next time i come i will sleep at your house.",
  "but now i have to go.",
  "sir will i get three wishes like my neighbor.",
  "maybe just get on the horse and go home your wishes will come true.",
  "but i advise you and your wife not to wish if you don't want any bad luck.",
  "when roger heard the old man would give him three wishes.",
  "he was so happy that he didn't pay attention to the warning.",
  "he happily went back home.",
  "along the way he just focused on thinking about what he should wish for.",
  "what should i wish for to become wealthy.",
  "a mountain of gold or a field of gems.",
  "on the way roger felt very uncomfortable because the horse had no saddle and the road was very bumpy.",
  "he fell down several times.",
  "jeez if only i could get a new saddle that would be great.",
  "as soon as he finished speaking a new saddle appeared in front of him.",
  "so one of the wishes had become true.",
  "roger scratched his head with regret he complained.",
  "oh my god a precious wish was gone just for the stupid saddle.",
  "how stupid i was.",
  "roger had to carry the saddle home when he arrived may rush out to meet him.",
  "how's it going did you meet him.",
  "were you able to get three wishes from him.",
  "roger was annoyed with his wife's questions but he still told may everything.",
  "along the way i wish for a saddle because riding a horse with that one was very uncomfortable.",
  "oh my god you're so useless.",
  "you have wasted a wish for just a saddle.",
  "why were you so silly.",
  "may was very annoyed and scolded her husband.",
  "roger tried to keep calm.",
  "but may just kept scolding him more and more and that made him really upset.",
  "he couldn't stand her anymore so he shouted.",
  "what you shut up.",
  "i wish there was something to cover your mouth.",
  "immediately the shadow flew and covered mae's mouth.",
  "now she couldn't say anything.",
  "roger was terrified.",
  "he quickly ran over and pulled the saddle out of mae's mouth but it couldn't be removed.",
  "roger panicked and quickly said his last wish.",
  "i wish my wife could return to normal.",

  "finally may could speak again.",
  "but now all their three wishes were gone.",
  "oh my god i can speak again.",
  "even though may could speak again they.",
  "still regretted their silly wishes.",
  "since then they were always angry.",
  "they yelled at each other every day.",
