  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GZpbaHeSs4&list=PLPHb4PtMjk0shrC0nwgRMvWwEDESn8KHc\">have you just ordered some skates</a>",
  "have you just ordered some skates.",
  "and you want to start practicing before they arrive.",
  "maybe you have a fear of falling.",
  "or you've plateaued.",
  "or you just want to improve your skating stick around.",
  "and i'm going to show you some skills.",
  "you can practice without your skates.",
  "on which will help you gain confidence.",
  "and control when you're skating.",
  "first of all.",
  "let's cover posture.",
  "i've got my sparkly Posture trainers on this evening.",
  "so you need to think about bending your knees.",
  "i've said it over and over.",
  "but a knee bend isn't just there.",
  "it's right down.",
  "so your knee is over your toes with your posture.",
  "it's absolutely fine to be a little bit further forwards.",
  "when you're starting this sort of position is great.",
  "because if you start to wobble.",
  "you're so close to the ground already.",
  "it's okay.",
  "this is why children seem to be.",
  "so good at learning to skate.",
  "because they're really close to the ground.",
  "it doesn't hurt as much.",
  "but if you're up.",
  "here you've got a lot further to go.",
  "before you hit the deck.",
  "than if you're already very bent and down here.",
  "and forward is the key never lean back.",
  "always ends badly always lean forward.",
  "so you're going to start off really low.",
  "and really over.",
  "as you get better you will.",
  "be able to straighten up.",
  "it's a really good idea to practice this posture.",
  "looking in the mirror side on.",
  "because a lot of beginners are like.",
  "i'm really bending my knees.",
  "you look in the mirror you go oh actually.",
  "that's not much of an event.",
  "so when you think you're bending your knee.",
  "just bend it a little bit more.",
  "and then that's probably.",
  "where you need to be with the knee bend.",
  "it's not just bend and stay there.",
  "you Knees are Shock Absorbers need.",
  "to have this softness in your knee.",
  "because this is your shock absorber.",
  "when you're skating.",
  "these are going to really help you absorb all the bumps and the wobbles.",
  "which is really important.",
  "one last thing with posture is your arms.",
  "Arms & Shoulders.",
  "and your shoulders.",
  "so your shoulders will indicate which way you're going to go.",
  "so if you want to turn you turn your shoulders first.",
  "so you need to keep your shoulders square.",
  "which will then go down through your hips.",
  "and your feet which will be shoulder width apart.",
  "so these are our friends.",
  "so i always say to the kids airplane arms.",
  "think of a tight rope walker.",
  "they have their really long pole for balance.",
  "so we can use our arms for balance.",
  "and this really really helps.",
  "i know sometimes it feels a little bit uncomfortable.",
  "but hey it works so let's just go with it.",
  "the next couple of bits are going to be some quite dynamic exercises.",
  "so it's really good if you've warmed up.",
  "your body a little bit before you do these.",
  "one of the biggest things is falling.",
  "everyone says i want to skate.",
  "but i'm scared of falling.",
  "so the thing that we all do.",
  "because everybody does it when you're going to fall.",
  "you helicopter.",
  "because it's a natural thing and that's it.",
  "so you have to muscle memory.",
  "a safer way to control the fall.",
  "when you feel the wobble.",
  "you need to squat like that.",
  "the best way to do this is not necessarily hands.",
  "on your knees because it does push your weight too far forward.",
  "so if you think more about going down like that.",
  "i'm actually in a staggered stance when i'm doing this.",
  "so you could try that as well.",
  "because this is a really good position.",
  "to learn to skate in with this staggered stance.",
  "because it gives you more control.",
  "so staggered starts.",
  "arms out i'm wobbling squat.",
  "so practice that and get the muscle memory.",
  "so you don't do this instead.",
  "so this one you don't want to do.",
  "with your skates on.",
  "and you'll see why in a minute.",
  "so back during lockdown.",
  "i was doing my lilly sudbury videos as we do.",
  "and i came across this exercise.",
  "which is fantastic.",
  "and i was like that is a great exercise for skaters.",
  "so it's a side lunge.",
  "but we're going to do it with our arms out.",
  "because that's how we skate.",
  "and what you're going to do is you're going to push from here.",
  "and balance on this foot.",
  "so it's a great weight transfer.",
  "so up and then bounce on this foot.",
  "so this helps you feel.",
  "that you have to be central so you can do this over and over.",
  "and every time you can feel how the weight has to transfer.",
  "so you can feel if your weight's too far to the inside.",
  "it'll pull you back and if it's too far to the outside it'll push you over.",
  "and it really helps you feel that for skating.",
  "and you can obviously do this on both feet.",
  "as much as i love my pink sparkly trainers.",
  "these are my favorite.",
  "so once your skate arrived obviously you.",
  "may only have your skates put them on.",
  "on the grass or the carpet.",
  "is where you want to try these moves.",
  "initially because you don't want to be rolling about too much.",
  "so you can try your posture.",
  "knee over toe arms out.",
  "when you're going to be doing the dynamic like the squats.",
  "so you need to warm up.",
  "but to be honest.",
  "it's a really good idea just to do a bit of warming up.",
  "before you skate every time anyway.",
  "so you don't pull something.",
  "so feel my posture nice and low.",
  "i've got a wobble go down.",
  "there we go.",
  "and we can't do the exact exercise to transfer our weight.",
  "but you can do marching.",
  "to try and get used to the idea of changing feet.",
  "and if you do it slightly to the side.",
  "it means you have to shift your weight more.",
  "so rather than just marching.",
  "you can keep your weight central.",
  "but if you step to the side and lift.",
  "you have to keep that weight over your skate.",
  "and it makes you do it more.",
  "it's a really good idea to practice these moves.",
  "specifically the squat with your safety gear on.",
  "and also all of it.",
  "because it gets you used.",
  "to the feel of your helmet and your wrist guards.",
  "but the squats and things are going to feel different with your knee pads on.",
  "so it's really good to practice it like this.",
  "with them on.",
  "now one really cool thing about knee pads.",
  "especially the bigger ones.",
  "like the 187s that kind of thing the ones.",
  "that are really big.",
  "which really protect you.",
  "which are fantastic.",
  "is they make you bend your knee.",
  "because if you straighten your knee.",
  "they dig in but if you bend your knee.",
  "they're much more comfortable.",
  "so all that's left for you to do now.",
  "is to start moving.",
  "um i've got a video on that which i'll link to.",
  "and it shows you the marching technique to start moving.",
  "and it also covers lacing turning your socks inside out for comfort.",
  "and tightening your wheels to control the roll.",
  "i hope this video has helped you gain lots of confidence.",
  "and control of your skates.",
  "i'm katie you've been watching skatey.",
  "and i'll see you next time bye.",
  "improve your confidence.",
  "and i was good wasn't it.",
  "so one last point.",
  "i keep doing this.",
  "which are in line with your feet.",
  "which is square just about practice these moves.",
  "so you want to keep.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBygMK8jRoI&list=PLPHb4PtMjk0shrC0nwgRMvWwEDESn8KHc&index=2\">so you want to keep</a>",
  "you've waited weeks for your skates to arrive.",
  "your safety gear's here.",
  "all you've got to do now.",
  "escaped.",
  "stick around and i'll show you how.",
  "roller skating for beginners.",
  "before you even put your skates on.",
  "there's a couple of tips i can give you.",
  "that will help with your journey.",
  "my boots are really old and really soft.",
  "so i skate without socks.",
  "but all boots have a break-in period.",
  "during this period they're new.",
  "they're hard and they will hurt and rub your feet.",
  "so obviously you're going to.",
  "want to wear a sock.",
  "you can buy skating socks which have no seams.",
  "but the main seam that most people have a problem with.",
  "is the toe seam.",
  "so a really good trick is to just wear your socks inside out.",
  "because then the seam is on the outside.",
  "and it's not against your foot.",
  "which is great.",
  "another spot that new skates tend to rub.",
  "is round your ankle.",
  "so a really good.",
  "trick for this is to actually fold the sock back down again.",
  "so then you've got two layers at the ankle.",
  "and that really helps as well.",
  "so another really important thing.",
  "is the way you lace your boots.",
  "these laces down here are really baggy.",
  "but as you get to this middle section of your foot.",
  "here this bit needs to be tight to lock your heel in.",
  "now some skaters actually wear a strap.",
  "to really lock that in if you have trouble.",
  "and when you get to your hooks.",
  "there's a trick with these.",
  "you always go from the top down.",
  "and that locks in the lace.",
  "so it doesn't come undone.",
  "it also prevents these from breaking.",
  "because if you wrap it around the other.",
  "way it puts more pressure on them.",
  "it's important to mention.",
  "that very often your skates do need adjusting.",
  "straight out of the box.",
  "and i've done a video on that before.",
  "so i won't cover all of that again.",
  "i'll put a link to it up here.",
  "one thing i will mention.",
  "is if you're having trouble standing.",
  "and you feel your skates are running away with you.",
  "what you can do is intentionally.",
  "over tighten your wheels.",
  "so they don't roll as fast and that will.",
  "help you to get used to the idea of it rolling.",
  "but it will be slower.",
  "so that's a really good trick to help you get going.",
  "so the last thing.",
  "is my safety gear embrace it.",
  "it is part of the look.",
  "it's there to keep you safe.",
  "don't bother if other people at the rink or at the park.",
  "they're not wearing it.",
  "wear it keep yourself safe.",
  "it will help with your confidence if you fall over it.",
  "doesn't hurt you're going to want to do it again.",
  "Standing.",
  "first things first let's stand up.",
  "now with skating you don't want to try.",
  "and get up like this.",
  "because it's not going to happen.",
  "so what you need to do.",
  "is stand up from a kneel.",
  "so if you get into a kneeling position.",
  "and from here.",
  "break the knee pads by the way.",
  "put one foot up.",
  "and then you want a hand either side.",
  "and then you lift get the other foot.",
  "and before you take your hands off.",
  "make sure you've got your balance.",
  "keep your knees bent.",
  "and we're standing.",
  "let's do it from a bench as well.",
  "so the bench is pretty similar.",
  "but often your feet can roll.",
  "i'm actually on an incline here.",
  "it's good to start with your feet in a v position.",
  "so they don't go anywhere.",
  "so put your weight forward.",
  "so the weight is on the balls of your feet.",
  "and then lift so make sure the.",
  "weight's still forward on the balls of your feet.",
  "now this v position will stop your feet from.",
  "rolling off before you're ready and balanced.",
  "Moving.",
  "so we've covered moving in an earlier video.",
  "where i showed you how to do bubbles.",
  "i'm going to show you a different technique.",
  "this technique is like marching.",
  "so you're marching with your feet out.",
  "but you can gather speed quite quickly with this one.",
  "and it feels like you're skating straight away.",
  "which is why it's such a nice one.",
  "if you do feel like you're going too fast.",
  "out of your comfort zone.",
  "you can tighten those wheels up.",
  "so before we move the weight needs to be over the ball of your foot.",
  "it's over the ball of your foot.",
  "that means it's mainly over your front truck.",
  "which is where we want the weight.",
  "because it's much safer to fall forwards.",
  "than it is to fall backwards right let's go.",
  "so all we're going to do is just a marching position with your feet turned out.",
  "and what will happen is your wheels will start to roll.",
  "because that's what they want to do.",
  "knees bent.",
  "put your arms out for safety if you feel more balanced.",
  "if you start to feel a wobble.",
  "grab the ankles.",
  "it's really natural to helicopter try.",
  "not to do that.",
  "try and reach for the ankles.",
  "okay let's try again.",
  "so it's just a marching movement.",
  "and you don't need to push.",
  "because your wheels will start to do that for you anyway.",
  "so whilst you're marching if you feel like you're uncomfortable.",
  "and you're going too fast you can just roll.",
  "so let your feet go parallel.",
  "and you can just roll.",
  "lose some speed and then start marching again.",
  "i've shown you moving and i've shown you.",
  "if you're going too fast you can just roll.",
  "but obviously at some point you're gonna need to stop.",
  "so i have done a dedicated stopping video.",
  "so it's probably best to go and watch.",
  "that but the easiest one for an absolute beginner to try is the plow stop.",
  "you're marching then let your wheels roll.",
  "and at this point you want to push them in towards each other.",
  "but the weight on the outside of the skate.",
  "and that will stop you.",
  "so let me show you one more time nice and quick.",
  "so i'm just rolling.",
  "and then weight goes on the outside of the skates.",
  "so you're leaning on your little toe.",
  "and it should bring you to a stop.",
  "Body Position.",
  "everyone says bend your knee.",
  "but i can guarantee you're not bending your knee.",
  "as much as you think you are.",
  "so a good way to think of it.",
  "is to think of getting your knee.",
  "over your toe.",
  "and that gets your hips down as well.",
  "which is where you need to be.",
  "so that way you're already low to the ground.",
  "so if you're gonna wobble.",
  "you can save it much easier.",
  "hopefully this video has given you a few.",
  "Bye bye.",
  "really good tips to get you on your skating journey.",
  "i'm katie you're watching skatey.",
  "and i'll see you next time.",
  "bye.",
  "Outtakes.",
  "that you're gonna be.",
  "nope i said.",
  "okay the weight in everything of skating.",
  "no.",
  "i'm just just say it don't just go on.",
  "about it just say.",
  "okay.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvhBbson-0A&list=PLPHb4PtMjk0shrC0nwgRMvWwEDESn8KHc&index=3\">okay</a>",
  "hi in this video we're going over the five most important things to get you rolling as quickly as possible.",
  "i'm katie and you're watching skatey.",
  "equipment.",
  "the most important thing you're going to need is obviously a pair of roller skates.",
  "there are so many to choose from.",
  "i would say rio rollers and moxie are very good.",
  "most people say.",
  "size up.",
  "i don't i say.",
  "you need your ball of your foot.",
  "over your wheels.",
  "so if you size up.",
  "it's going to be slightly in front of the ball of your foot.",
  "so but that's my personal preference.",
  "when you're buying skates.",
  "this bit here is a plate now some plates are plastic or nylon.",
  "if they're plastic.",
  "you need to look at the weight limit.",
  "because there will be a weight limit on them.",
  "so they may be child skates.",
  "and they'll fit your foot.",
  "but you need to check the weight limit.",
  "because obviously you don't be skating along and they snap.",
  "because you're going to be in big trouble.",
  "Equipment - Wheels.",
  "so with wheels.",
  "i'm on really soft wheels today.",
  "because i'm outside on the gravel.",
  "so these are a 75.",
  "which are about the softest wheels that you can get.",
  "if i was indoors in a rink.",
  "i'd probably be wearing my 90s or 100s.",
  "so i can spin easily.",
  "so the harder the wheel.",
  "the slippier it is.",
  "and the harder the ride.",
  "so if you're going outside.",
  "you want a nice soft wheel to give you a soft cruise.",
  "so you don't feel like you're being vibrated.",
  "Equipment - Laces.",
  "okay so if you have a boot like this.",
  "you may notice.",
  "that you've got these little hooks on the side.",
  "now when i do mine up.",
  "i hate when my skates get loose when i'm skating.",
  "and i have to stop and tighten them up.",
  "drives me crazy.",
  "all i want to do is skate.",
  "so what i do is.",
  "i go around the top of the hook.",
  "downwards.",
  "and that really locks it in.",
  "and keeps it really really tight.",
  "so you can concentrate on skating.",
  "and not doing your skates up every 10 minutes.",
  "Equipment - Toe Stops.",
  "so this is the toe stop.",
  "you're going to have toe stops.",
  "when you buy your skates.",
  "some skates will have a screw through them.",
  "these have are adjustable.",
  "so i put a little allen key in there.",
  "and i can adjust the toe stops.",
  "they're really good.",
  "but obviously some of the cheaper skates.",
  "you can't adjust the toe stops.",
  "again it's something that you have a personal preference on.",
  "i like my toe stops quite high.",
  "when i'm skating outside.",
  "just so i don't catch on a stone or something like that.",
  "but on my indoor skates.",
  "i had them lower so i can do tricks and stuff like that.",
  "if you're jam skating you might take these out completely.",
  "and put a little rubber bung in or a plug.",
  "and that's great too the plug doesn't really do anything.",
  "it's not functional.",
  "it just protects the rink from the metal.",
  "now i would say the most important thing with toe stops.",
  "is you're going to use them for stopping.",
  "so you don't want them too high.",
  "so you want your skate at about a 45 degree angle when you.",
  "when you put your toe stop down.",
  "any higher you're going to be off balance.",
  "any lower you risk if you're outdoors particularly.",
  "you risk catching a stone or something under there.",
  "when you're skating forwards.",
  "you're going to wipe out.",
  "you really don't want to do that.",
  "Equipment - Safety Gear.",
  "so the last piece of equipment.",
  "that i would highly recommend as a beginner.",
  "you will notice that i am not wearing.",
  "um pads are really important.",
  "as a beginner they will give you confidence.",
  "because falling is inevitable.",
  "we're going to talk about falling in a minute.",
  "um so i'd recommend knee pads elbow pads.",
  "probably wrist pads or as i've got leather gloves.",
  "and if you fall over on this sort of surface fast.",
  "you've got to save yourself somehow.",
  "and chances are you're going to use your hands.",
  "so i recommend leather gloves.",
  "or um you can get some really nice bike gloves.",
  "people wear for cycling they look really good.",
  "and you know what.",
  "if you really are a beginner.",
  "and you've never skated before.",
  "maybe popping a cycle helmet on.",
  "wouldn't be the worst thing that you could do.",
  "just to keep yourself safe until you get your balance.",
  "and then you can be like me and just be stupid.",
  "and take everything off and then when you hit the deck.",
  "it's bad.",
  "but i would personally recommend as a beginner.",
  "definitely kick yourself out with some safety gear.",
  "Falling.",
  "falling.",
  "so falling we've got to talk about it.",
  "it's definitely going to happen especially when you're learning.",
  "so that's why we mentioned about pads.",
  "so you definitely want knee pads elbow pads wrist pads.",
  "and maybe a cycle helmet as well.",
  "it's really important to protect yourself.",
  "when you're skating.",
  "and it will give you confidence as well.",
  "i always say the most important thing.",
  "with falling is if you can try and control the fall.",
  "so bend your knees.",
  "get your hands down.",
  "try and reach the ground as safely as possible.",
  "with as few injuries as you can manage.",
  "and once you've fallen.",
  "you've got to get back up again.",
  "so the easiest way to get back up.",
  "from sitting on the floor on a pair of skates.",
  "so one hand either side get one foot up.",
  "then the other get your balance and up.",
  "you're going to be pros in no time.",
  "Standing.",
  "standing.",
  "okay so this is going to be challenging.",
  "because if you've never stood in a pair of roller skates before.",
  "the wheels are very free-flowing.",
  "and you literally just kind of ah.",
  "so bend your knees keep your knees really really soft.",
  "you want to imagine that there's a line.",
  "that goes right down the center of your body.",
  "and you want to keep your shoulder square.",
  "and your weight right in the middle.",
  "so you're really solid your weight needs to be slightly.",
  "to the front of the skate.",
  "if you keep your weight to the front.",
  "it stops you falling back.",
  "trust me i've done it you do not want to fall backwards.",
  "keep your weight to the front.",
  "even if you're in this sort of position at first.",
  "it doesn't matter.",
  "get confident and then you can straighten up.",
  "when you get better.",
  "but the most important thing at this stage.",
  "is to get confident and safe.",
  "Moving.",
  "moving.",
  "so now you're standing.",
  "we're going to put the same thing.",
  "into practice to get you moving.",
  "so you want a nice soft knees.",
  "and the best way to start.",
  "is with a snake pattern.",
  "Moving - Snake Pattern / Bubbles.",
  "so with the snake pattern.",
  "you have your feet pointing out.",
  "and you're going to lean on your little toe and push.",
  "then when you get to here you're going to lean on your big toe.",
  "and pull back in again.",
  "so the most important thing to remember.",
  "when you're doing a snake pattern is.",
  "you don't want your feet to touch together at the front.",
  "otherwise we'll be practicing falling.",
  "so remember before your feet get too close.",
  "you need to swap the weight.",
  "and take it back onto the little toes.",
  "and take yourself back out again.",
  "like this.",
  "knees soft arms out.",
  "this is the safest way to get started.",
  "because you haven't.",
  "got to lift your feet yet.",
  "Moving - Trucks.",
  "if you're having trouble getting your snake pattern.",
  "it might be.",
  "that your trucks are too tight.",
  "if you look at my skate you see how my wheels can move.",
  "if you haven't got movement in your trucks.",
  "you're going to find this really hard.",
  "so you might need to loosen them off a little bit.",
  "Moving - Marching.",
  "so now you've mastered your snake pattern.",
  "we're going to start lifting our feet.",
  "and transferring the body weight.",
  "so we're going to march.",
  "so the most important thing here is to feel.",
  "that all of your weights going on each foot every time.",
  "now what will happen is you should feel.",
  "that your wheels automatically start to roll.",
  "and this is getting us ready for the next bit.",
  "so keep your arms out.",
  "nice and soft if you turn your feet outwards.",
  "it will help you gain some speed.",
  "we're rolling.",
  "Moving - Stroke Skating.",
  "so let's get you proper skating.",
  "so you're really close.",
  "so all you need to do now is rather than lifting the knee.",
  "is put the knee behind you.",
  "and there you are.",
  "you're skating still keeping those knees really soft.",
  "transfer the weight to each foot.",
  "you'll find if you don't transfer your weight.",
  "you'll be skating like this.",
  "because your weight is central.",
  "so you must transfer the weight to each foot each time.",
  "Stopping.",
  "stopping.",
  "so we've done sanding we've done moving.",
  "i better show you how to stop.",
  "because you're gonna have to do that at some point.",
  "so to stop i'm gonna teach you three basic ways.",
  "one is with your toe stop.",
  "one is called a snow plow.",
  "and one is with your wheels.",
  "because i find.",
  "when i'm outside.",
  "i'd rather use my wheels to stop than my toe stop.",
  "because obviously the asphalt.",
  "is just going to wear your toe stop down really really quickly.",
  "this is the snow plow.",
  "Stopping - Snow Plough.",
  "for the snow plow.",
  "you want to put your weight just like.",
  "when we did the snake pattern.",
  "on the outside on your little toes okay.",
  "and just push outwards.",
  "Stopping - Toe Stop.",
  "so the next way to stop.",
  "i'm going to show you.",
  "is with your toe stop.",
  "so for this one you need to be able to balance.",
  "on one leg to be able to put your toe stop down.",
  "so the third way to stop.",
  "Stopping - Outside alternative.",
  "is that what i use when i'm outside.",
  "because i don't want to wear my toe stop away.",
  "so rather than using my toe stop.",
  "i'm going to use my front two wheels.",
  "well i hope you're now rolling away.",
  "and enjoying your new skates.",
  "now this video has been a very brief overview.",
  "of quite a few important points.",
  "so what we'll be doing in the future.",
  "is bringing out videos.",
  "which explain each point in a lot more detail.",
  "but until then this was skatey.",
  "happy rolling.",
  "Outtakes.",
  "instead of using my toe stop.",
  "i'm going to use my front two wheel.",
  "my front two wheels.",
  "i might just do that again.",
  "i don't know what i thought after that.",
  "i remember sounded good."
