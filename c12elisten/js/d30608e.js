  "i think so.",
  "jim he and i are working on a school project together our grades depend on it.",
  "but jim and he are convinced that other students are also working on the same topic.",
  "they want to work on a new topic.",
  "if your grades depend on it you should listen to what they are saying.",
  "ah but dear i think they are just panicking.",
  "i don't think our grades will get affected much by a common topic.",
  "is there a chance of it happening though.",
  "yes there is.",
  "okay let me tell you the tale of the three fish.",
  "and then you can decide upon what to do.",
  "the tale of three fish.",
  "once upon a time there was a serene lake.",
  "full of different kinds of fish.",

  "brothers look at this lake.",
  "it is so big and clean.",
  "it has so many different kinds of fish too.",
  "yes i agree.",
  "look at those big fish there.",

  "i am sure the fish are healthy too.",
  "we never fish in this lake.",
  "but i think we should begin now.",
  "yes it is late today to throw the net.",
  "let us come back early tomorrow morning and fish here.",
  "when the fishermen were discussing their plan.",
  "there were three fish that were swimming close to the surface of the lake.",
  "they overheard the entire conversation.",
  "they collected all the other fish in the lake and told them what they had heard.",
  "the fishermen are going to come tomorrow and throw the nets to catch us all.",
  "i am going to leave this lake with my family tonight itself.",
  "yes i am also not going to stay here.",
  "i will also leave the lake with my family.",
  "we will find a new safer home.",
  "look at you two.",
  "talking like cowards our forefathers came here to this lake and made it a home.",
  "many generations before us have lived here.",
  "how can you even think of abandoning our home like this.",
  "listen to us brother those fishermen will come tomorrow and kill everyone.",
  "our scriptures say that when it is time for a death there is nothing we can do about it.",
  "we cannot escape it.",
  "so let us stay in our home and face our death bravely.",
  "soon the fish were divided into two groups.",
  "some of them agreed to leave and some decided to continue living in the lake.",
  "the ones who had decided to stay laughed at the ones who were leaving.",
  "but those who had decided to leave paid no heed to their mockery.",
  "and started leaving the lake through a small outlet.",
  "let them go brothers.",
  "soon they will regret leaving their home.",
  "but it was not so.",
  "when morning came the fishermen came back as planned  [Applause].",
  "they cast their net onto the lake.",
  "they caught every single fish that had stayed back.",
  "none was spared and the fishermen went back home happy to have found a lake full of so many fish.",
  "the only thing that the dying fish felt was regret for not having left the lake.",
  "the fish had a warning of danger yet some of them decided to stay back.",
  "that's what got them into trouble.",
  "yes don't you think you too have a warning of danger ahead.",
  "oh you are right tia.",
  "i am going to tell jim and joe that we should change the topic for our project thanks tia."
