  "hercules was about to chase that person when medusa stopped him.",
  "she suddenly fell down in front of hercules which startled him.",
  "it turned out that the arrow had touched her cheek and left a small scratch.",
  "medusa was poisoned.",
  "the poison quickly spread out all over her body.",
  "hades owner of the underworld please come here.",
  "i didn't expect that hercules the hero would call me one day.",
  "hades you are the owner of the underworld can you tell me what is happening to her.",
  "hold on there is something wrong here.",
  "medusa's fate is not today but her name is gradually appearing on the poneglyph of life and death.",
  "this is the first time i have seen this poison it is quite special.",
  "now if you want to save medusa there's only one way the golden apple.",

  "on the peak was a giant tree with golden apples.",
  "while standing beside the tree were two cyclops realizing that what was going to happen may cause danger to his partner.",
  "hercules let pegasus stay in a grassland and he started to approach the tree.",
  "when hercules reached the summit he heard the two cyclops were arguing fiercely.",
  "the most important thing in this world is intelligence.",
  "no it must be strength.",
  "intelligence strength.",
  "hello can you guys stop for a while and hear me say.",
  "i'm in a rush to save a girl.",
  "uh lady and she was poisoned.",
  "can i have one golden apple to bring her back to life.",
  "the two cyclops looked at each other and laughed [Music].",
  "the golden apple is very valuable you cannot have it easily.",
  "if you can beat our intelligence and strength you will receive the apple as a reward.",
  "we will have an intelligence competition.",
  "i'll give you a question you answer and then we switch.",
  "if you can pass it you win.",
  "let's do it.",
  "let me see if you can do it.",
  "if i have it i don't share it.",

  "what is it.",
  "it is secret.",
  "don't tell me that it is wrong.",
  "huh that's right.",
  "the correct answer was given too quickly.",
  "which went beyond her expectation.",
  "now let's answer my question it's simple.",
  "what is the fastest way to pass a huge rock that blocked your road.",
  "i thought it must be difficult.",
  "we just need to make a tunnel through the rock.",
  "then we could have a shortcut that could be used for a long time.",
  "a good idea but it is not the fastest way.",
  "i choose to use my power to move the rock aside there couldn't be any faster way.",
  "surprised at such a simple answer the blue giant couldn't say a word.",
  "i know that intelligence won't work.",
  "my turn.",
  "so what is your challenge.",
  "strength we will fight until you give up.",
  "or me but i've never thought of it.",
  "alright i agree.",
  "then the giant approached the young man but she fell down without a reason.",
  "what about that.",
  "is it enough.",
  "didn't wait for hercules to finish his sentence the giant stood up immediately.",
  "under her feet a stream of power from the earth went inside her body.",
  "she had become stronger.",
  "continue.",
  "on the peak hesperides which is guarded by the cyclops children of the earth there is a tree that produces golden apples.",
  "children of the earth.",
  "so it turned out this giant gained power from the earth.",
  "i just need to prevent her from the ground.",
  "the giant kept coming at her opponent violently.",
  "this time she grew stronger and it troubled hercules so much more.",
  "how was that is it enough to beat you.",
  "just a little bit more.",
  "then the hero used all of his strength to punch the giant's feet which tossed her into the air.",
  "but this time hercules quickly acted to prevent her from touching the ground.",
  "with that distance the giant cannot gain power from the earth she gradually shrunk and lost her power.",
  "oh you look like me now how about a little kiss to the ground and see what will happen.",
  "if i hit the ground with this body i would die.",
  "i surrender.",
  "then hercules finally beat the two cyclops the keepers of golden apple tree.",
  "unbelievable but you won.",
  "here is your reward one stands for wisdom one stands for strength.",
  "you deserve two of them.",
  "thanks a lot but after this maybe you guys can.",
  "see that if you knew how to combine wisdom and strength.",
  "i wouldn't have a chance to win.",
  "wisdom and strength are necessary and they should go together.",
  "pegasus come here.",
  "upon coming back hades was glad to see hercules brought the golden apple.",
  "where is the apple.",
  "what do we do now.",
  "you need to suck the poisoned blood first then let her eat the apple it will work immediately.",
  "hercules stepped next to medusa who lying unconsciously on the bed.",
  "he couldn't stop himself from shedding tears.",
  "can you do it or let me do that.",
  "hercules stood beside medusa trying to suck all the poison from the wound.",
  "when he finished medusa hasn't woken yet.",
  "he had to squeeze the apple and drop the juice into her mouth.",
  "thanks to the magical juice medusa was completely recovered.",
  "but gradually the poison that hercules sucked from medusa's wound started to affect him.",
  "he lost his holy strength and his body became weakened.",
  "seeing hercules fall down hades was satisfied it seemed that this was his plan [Music] [Laughter].",
  "let me tell you this.",
  "that hunter was hired by me to do the assassinate with the target is you but she saved your life.",
  "this golden apple is a holy fruit it can absorb all poison and bring one person to his strongest era.",
  "the poison sucking was aiming on you.",
  "i created this poison just to let you lose all of your power but i didn't expect that she had to bear the pain.",
  "i really didn't mean to do that [Laughter].",
  "now you are no more than immortal there couldn't be a better chance for me to get rid of you.",
  "[Laughter] [Music].",
  "do not try to do evil things on me and my beloved ever again.",
  "i doubted that there was something wrong he couldn't help me easily like that it is lucky that i have two apples.",
  "thank you cyclops sisters [Music] her achilles.",
  "medusa's weak voice woke hercules soul he brought back the reassurance that she always longed for.",
  "once again our hero hercules showed his power and wisdom in the fight against the evil lord of the underworld haiti.",
  "once upon a time at the bottom of the deep ocean there was a magical kingdom which no one had ever heard about.",
  "there were many kinds of inhabitants there such as marine species and also beautiful mermaids.",
  "they all lived together in harmony the kingdom was governed by poseidon the king of the sea and queen mother eliza.",
  "poseidon had three daughters and a deceased wife whom he loved so much.",

  "whenever she wandered around she was often willing to help all creatures in the ocean who were in difficulty.",
  "that's why she won everyone's love.",
  "she had two close friends named molly and dolphin  which were a whale and a dolphin.",
  "also she had a wonderful and captivating voice inherited from her mother.",
  "every time she sang all species listened attentively.",
  "ariel really wanted to know more about the world outside.",
  "but her father and grandmother always forbad her.",
  "they never allowed the three princesses to leave the kingdom.",
  "everything i do is just to protect you.",
  "the human world is very dangerous.",
  "also the rules set on the ground are different from ours.",
  "your father is right.",
  "outside this kingdom there are many lurking dangers which you can never imagine.",
  "but i really want to meet humans.",
  "do they look like us grandma.",
  "humans have feet to walk on land but we don't.",
  "they can only live for about 100 years but our life can last for 300 years.",
  "when mermaids die we will turn into sponges and disappear into the ocean forever [Music].",
  "i really want to meet people and see the scenery on the mainland.",
  "i believe that they are also as kind as us.",
  "since having been told about the outside world by her friends ariel was more curious.",
  "then she decided to make her escape with the help of her friends.",
  "molly had lived in this kingdom for so long.",
  "together with the dolphin they can freely go in and out of the aquatic gate without being prevented by any guards.",
  "going outside the gate molly opened his.",
  "mouth and thus ariel could escape.",
  "by that way for the very first time she had a chance to observe the beautiful world above the water.",
  "so amazing.",
  "huh dolphin there are some sounds there look a boat.",
  "a boat was approaching.",
  "it was prince william's boat and everyone on the boat was celebrating his 20th birthday party.",
  "a prince of the land he looks so handsome and elegant.",
  "ariel we are too close to humans.",
  "people on the boat seem to be very dangerous.",
  "you better go back or they can see us hmm.",
  "no dolphin he doesn't look like a bad guy.",
  "seeing him i just want to sing.",
  "hearing such a beautiful voice william looked around surprisingly.",
  "then he caught a glimpse of a beautiful mermaid singing passionately out there.",
  "realizing that ariel worriedly dived into the deep ocean.",
  "am i dizzy no way it's obviously a pretty red-haired mermaid.",
  "it's definitely her who owns that beautiful voice.",
  "from the bottom of the ocean there was a dark cave which wasn't far from the kingdom.",
  "it's the place where the cruel sea witch named madeleine lived.",
  "she used to live in the palace of poseidon but then was sent away for the evil things she had done.",
  "she had a servant named Brado which is a ferocious shark.",
  "poseidon's youngest daughter has fallen in love with a human.",
  "finally it's time for me to take revenge.",
  "oh great congratulations my master.",
  "but what's your plan.",
  "you fool just wait and see [Music].",
  "thunder lightning come on pour out a great rain and wind on the boat immerse it by the huge tidal waves of the ocean.",
  "after madeleine's incantation a storm immediately destroyed the boat.",
  "right after that it sank like a stone.",
  "oh no the boat is sinking.",
  "dolphin we have to save them.",
  "and dolphins swam quickly but they only managed to save prince william and brought him ashore.",
  "prince please open your eyes.",
  "what a relief you are finally awake now.",
  "william is over there.",
  "ariel people are coming we have to go.",
  "ariel panicked and hurriedly jumped into the ocean with dolphin and hid herself.",
  "just a few moments later a king and a princess arrived there they looked so relieved since william was still fine.",
  "william are you okay i am july your fiancee.",
  "i'm fine july father there's a girl who saved me.",
  "i can't see her face clearly but she has red hair and.",
  "what else well nothing more i've just forgotten.",
  "she is undoubtedly a mermaid who said that beautiful song.",
  "ariel returned to her palace.",
  "but she couldn't help thinking about prince william.",
  "king poseidon had already noticed that.",
  "ariel you didn't listen to me and escaped from the palace without my permission.",
  "from now on i forbid you from going to the ocean's surface one more time.",
  "ariel was very disappointed '.",
  "she still wanted to see the prince again.",
  "while she was sharing this to dolphin the shark brado arrived.",
  "are you sad since you can't see the prince again princess.",
  "how could you know can you help me the only person who can help you become a human and be with the prince is the witch madeline.",
  "you will be happy right after meeting her.",
  "huh because of her desire to see william again ariel agreed immediately.",
  "but dolphin hurriedly dissuaded her from that idea.",
  "you can't do that ariel.",
  "you will be in trouble if your father knows about that.",
  "stop talking don't destroy her happiness [Music].",
  "after that ariel comforted dolphin and followed brado to madeleine's cave.",
  "the witch had seen it all through her magical sphere [Music] [Laughter].",
  "everything happened just as i've expected [Music].",
  "i want to become a human so as to meet the prince again.",
  "could you help me.",
  "how easy i will give you a potion that can turn your tail into a human's feet.",
  "hence you can walk on land with your prince.",
  "in return i want your sweet voice.",
  "but remember if the prince marries another girl you will die and become a sponge forever.",
  "can you do that for the love of your life [Music].",
  "because of her love for william and the desire to be with him.",
  "ariel accepted to drink the potion [Music].",
  "now your sweet voice is mine.",
  "ariel started to swim to the surface of the ocean.",
  "her mermaid tail slowly disappeared replaced by humans legs.",
  "she went ashore and tried to get used to her feet.",
  "william was also there.",
  "he wanted to find the one who saved him the day before.",
  "seeing a beautiful red-haired girl.",
  "he then ran to get acquainted to her.",
  "hello i'm prince william.",
  "you look so familiar as if we had met before right.",
  "but ariel didn't own her voice anymore she couldn't say a single word but just nodding.",
  "it seems like she isn't able to talk.",
  "Poor her so she isn't the girl i'm looking for.",
  "how could i forget that voice.",
  "however it was gracious of him to help ariel and let her come to his palace.",
  "the king was preparing for the wedding of william and princess july there.",
  "he didn't love july but the girl who saved him.",
  "but he didn't dare to disobey his father's order.",
  "ariel was so sad since she couldn't say anything with william.",
  "and the next day when his wedding occurred she would have to turn into sponge forever.",
  "at that time dolphin came back and told the whole story to ariel's two sisters.",
  "they quickly swam to the witch madeleine's cave without letting the king know anything.",
  "madeline please let arielle be.",
  "we will be very grateful to you.",
  "[Laughter] what on earth brings the two princesses here to beg a witch like me.",
  "all right if ariel kills prince william with this knife our covenant will be broken and ariel will be a mermaid again.",
  "while ariel was about to live her last dawn in agony her two sisters arrived with madeleine's night.",
  "ariel you'd better use this knife to kill the prince so that you will be a mermaid again [Music].",
  "no sisters i can't do that.",
  "you should let him go since he will never love you.",
  "just do that and go back with us.",
  "ariel was extremely confused.",
  "bringing the knife she snuck into the prince's room while he was sleeping.",
  "but how could she do such an evil thing to the one she loves no.",
  "dying and turning into sponges are still better than killing him by myself.",
  "ariel returned to the seaside looking at the kn ife her sisters knew that she couldn't do it.",
  "william's marriage was about to take place when the sun rose.",
  "he reluctantly stepped beside the princess july he always thought about the mermaid who saved him.",
  "ariel was so miserable that she jumped into the water and turned into a sparkling sponge which was the embodiment of her soul.",
  "as a result the sponge sank into the ocean.",
  "the sponge then drifted to the ocean.",
  "tidal waves made it crash to the rock many times which had sounded like ariel's last singing before she disappeared.",
  "the sound echoed throughout the ocean and was even transmitted to shore.",
  "while the wedding was happening william suddenly heard the sound of a melodious voice which was nothing different from his beloved mermaid's voice.",
  "it is exactly her voice she is the one i love and i have to be with her at all costs.",
  "this marriage will be cancelled at that time under the ocean aerial sponges shattered and thus the little mermaid was saved from her covenant with madeleine.",
  "thank god ariel welcome back [Music].",
  "the prince has canceled the wedding ariel hasn't been vanished either.",
  "my perfect plan has been scrapped.",
  "all right then i myself will kill her.",
  "how lucky you are.",
  "but it won't make any sense at all since i will make poseidon pay.",
  "he will have to suffer it for the rest of his life.",
  "at that moment the scene was rough.",
  "poseidon gradually emerged from the water.",
  "no madeleine don't dream about it it will never happen.",
  "it turned out that the king was informed by his two daughters and went there to rescue ariel.",
  "poseidon i detest you no way i will let you alive today.",
  "you are not even my opponent bring ariel's voice back so that i can forgive you for our old friendship.",
  "madeline angrily used her magic to attack and poseidon pointed the trident at her.",
  "as she was still weaker she had to do her best to struggle with the sea king.",
  "at that moment miss eliza and ariel's two sisters also arrived and they simultaneously attacked madeleine.",
  "as the witch was distracted she was hit by poseidon.",
  "a miraculous scallop in her body flew out shattered into many pieces.",
  "immediately ariel's voice came back with her.",
  "oh great i got my voice back thank you everyone my family.",
  "everything won't happen like this i will definitely be back.",
  "wait and see william reached the shore right after the battle.",
  "seeing ariel he ran quickly towards her.",
  "finally i can see you the one who saved me that time.",
  "your beautiful voice has always been on my mind.",
  "my name is ariel thank you for recognizing me.",
  "after ariel introduced william to her family so that he could ask them for their wedding.",
  "they wished that the underwater kingdom and the mainland one could live together in harmony.",
  "ariel and william stood on the shore and talked to poseidon standing in the water.",
  "father we really love each other.",
  "wasn't my mother a human too.",
  "all right i agree.",
  "the very first mermaid to be a part of the human world.",
  "everyone had a chance to observe such a phenomenal wedding of a mermaid and a prince on the land.",
  "they lived happily for the rest of their lives.",
  "it was a long time ago in a small village there was a poor old couple.",
  "they hadn't got any children and they were really sad about that.",
  "i'm so sad you know why can't we have a child.",
  "i'm longing for that too even if he was a hedgehog [Music].",
  "they got what they wished for not long later the couple had a very pretty boy but his body was full of spikes.",
  "they were happy and worried at the same time and they named the boy spike.",
  "the father wanted to hug his child but he couldn't because of the spikes.",
  "spike would be in pain if he was put in the cradle.",
  "for that they had to make a strong nest in front of the heating and put spike there.",
  "they raised the boy very carefully despite being hit by the spikes every day.",
  "nevertheless they were very happy.",
  "the gods heard our prayer.",
  "this child must be our lucky star.",
  "it was true that since spike's birth luck kept coming to the old couple.",
  "their harvests were more abundant with barns full of cereals and cats.",
  "and they became richer day by day.",
  "the kid grew up to be a handsome and smart young man but there was still a layer of spikes on his back which hindered his daily activities.",
  "from childhood till now spike still had to sleep on the strong nest in order to avoid being hurt by his spikes.",
  "because of his bizarre appearance no one wanted to do friends spike.",
  "they didn't want to come near him for fear of being hurted by his spikes [Music].",
  "yes no one wants to befriend a person who has spikes in his back.",
  "that's right i'm a hedgehog [Music].",
  "seeing spike like that the father decided to forge him in iron and an iron trumpet.",
  "gods please hear my prayer and make this iron my son's best friend so he can become more confident in life.",
  "the shooting star once again flew through and his wish was fulfilled.",
  "the magic thing happened when the farmer brought the iron to spike it could carry him flexibly like a living creature [Music].",
  "hello master nice to meet you.",
  "unbelievable you're able to talk.",
  "since then the iron cop became spike's good friend and it was very loyal and brave with the iron trumpet spike became much more confident.",
  "mom dad i want to go to the jungle to help you.",
  "though the couple was very worried spike managed to persuade them [Music].",
  "spike led the goats into the jungle he sat on the iron top and blew the trumpet which was very ear catching.",
  "at the end of the day he led the goats back home because of him they had become plumper.",
  "one day the king and his troops suddenly appeared in the forest.",
  "a prosperous king got lost in a jungle.",
  "it's all because of you guys.",
  "your majesty it was you who chose this road.",
  "yes your majesty it was all our fault.",
  "don't you guys look for ways to escape now.",
  "it really drives me up the wall.",
  "there is a trumpet sound.",
  "follow that maybe the man knows how to get out of here.",
  "they were very surprised to see a young man with spikes all over his back riding an iron and blowing the trumpet [Music].",
  "young man i'm the ruler of this kingdom.",
  "i've been lost for a couple of days and i'm very starving.",
  "now help me.",
  "spike gave all of them his meals.",
  "he was very happy and ate all of his portion in a blink of an eye [Music].",
  "thank you young man.",
  "but why are there a lot of spikes on your back.",
  "your majesty i'm spike everyone often calls me hedgehog man.",
  "i had had this appearance since i was born.",
  "hedgehog spike i mean young man.",
  "if you can take me out of this place i will reward you with a lot of treasures.",
  "thank you sir but i don't need that much treasure.",
  "what do you need then.",
  "i just need someone to talk to and live with me for the rest of my life hmm it is no big deal.",
  "i will marry princess mila my daughter off to you provided that you take us out of here.",
  "spike was exuberant he wholeheartedly showed the king the way to get out of the jungle.",
  "they thanked him and said goodbye.",
  "master there's something not good about this king be careful.",
  "don't worry i don't think that he'll fool me.",
  "then spike rode the iron and led the goats back home.",
  "when the king returned to the palace princess mila happily came to welcome him.",
  "he talked about spike to her but didn't say that he promised to marry her off to him.",
  "a hedgehog young man who rode an iron and blue ear catching sounds helped you.",
  "so interesting he must be a good man.",
  "i've returned to the palace safe and sound there is no need to keep that promise.",
  "how can my daughter marry a hedgehog.",
  "no way if he dares to come here.",
  "i will let him know what would happen.",
  "if you guys see that hedgehog man ride the iron here just beat him for me.",
  "talking about spike he was very happy when the king promised to marry his daughter to him.",
  "the next day he said goodbye to his parents and set off.",
  "while riding the iron and blowing the trumpet he got to the palace very quickly.",
  "but the guards immediately stopped him.",
  "i'm spike i came here to meet the princess as promised.",
  "please tell the king for me.",
  "a bizarre hedgehog man like you dares to meet the king.",
  "the king will never meet you go away.",
  "the guard used spears to threaten spike.",
  "they even took arrows and aimed at him.",
  "but when the arrows hit the spikes they fell down and didn't hurt him at all.",
  "turns out the king didn't keep the promise.",
  "he didn't want to marry his daughter to me [Music].",
  "Yes I warned you master.",
  "Spike was very angry he took the iron trumpet and blew it really loud.",
  "Hey you stop right now.",
  "It is so deafening.",
  "inside princess mila heard the loud noise she came to the window and looked down and she saw a hedgehog fan riding an iron and blowing the trumpet in front of the gate.",
  "she was really interested and about to come down there but the king was already able to stop her.",
  "mila you can't go out.",
  "why father then he told her the whole story and how he promised to marry her to spike.",
  "you shouldn't do that a good king should keep his promise.",
  "moreover spike tried his best to help you [Music].",
  "stop talking i've made up my mind.",
  "that ugly hedgehog will get out of here soon.",
  "at the gate there were a lot of troops using spears and arrows to stop spike.",
  "because of his spikes he wasn't hurt at all.",
  "you better back up now [Music].",
  "don't do that father.",
  "it is really bad to break a promise and shoot arrows at the person who saved you.",
  "i'll never let a freak like that become my daughter's husband.",
  "in the jungle spike and iron cock thought of ways to fight back.",
  "oh i know what to do just follow me and we'll teach him a lesson.",
  "just like that like that.",
  "that night when the whole palace was in silence the iron followed spike's plan flew to the king's room and crowded.",
  "what what is that is there an intruder.",
  "you cursed chicken how dare you interrupt my sleep get lost.",
  "you liar king keep your promise to my master.",
  "guards come here and get this chicken away from me.",
  "when the guards arrived the iron flew away.",
  "but when the king was about to sleep it returned and crowded again.",
  "liar king keep your promise.",
  "just like that the iron disturbed the palace the whole night and made the king and the guards couldn't rest.",
  "they were exhausted with swollen eyes.",
  "in the daytime spike used his trumpet to disturb and made everyone go crazy.",
  "the king was furious but the guards couldn't do anything to spike.",
  "because of his spike cover spears and arrows weren't a threat to him.",
  "this kept going on for many days and made the king become weaker significantly.",
  "princess mila couldn't stand seeing her father like that she invited spike to the palace to reconcile.",
  "the iron stood on the wall proudly and crowded.",
  "princess mila i won't force you to marry me.",
  "but your father was too perverse so i had to teach him a lesson about keeping promises.",
  "princess mila really admired spike and she asked him to stay for one night.",
  "seeing that the sky had turned dark spike agreed and went to the room.",
  "at that time the iron also returned.",
  "you have been accompanying him all the time so you must know this.",
  "he always has to wear that spiky cover every day.",
  "actually it is not please do as i'm telling you now.",
  "it was a full moon night and spike removed his spiky cover as usual.",
  "he put it carefully next to his bed and caressed it like it is a part of his body.",
  "waiting for spike had fallen asleep.",
  "mila was waiting inside ran to his bed took the spiky cover and threw it into the burning stove.",
  "princess what are you doing.",
  "that hedgehog skin has always been with me since i was a kid it is a part of my body.",
  "no spike i'm releasing you from that destiny hedgehog skin.",
  "feel it now.",
  "this feeling is so great.",
  "i'm still strong and even more comfortable after it has gone.",
  "thank you princess mila.",
  "just because you helped me to remove the hedgehog skin that you hurt yourself.",
  "it doesn't matter at all at least i can help you now.",
  "mila took care of the king and pointed out what he had done wrong.",
  "she also talked about spike's good personalities that she noticed.",
  "eventually the king came to terms with that truth.",
  "maybe you are right i shouldn't judge spike over his appearance.",
  "he used that hedgehog skin to defeat my army.",
  "nevertheless i have to admit his wisdom and bravery.",
  "and when spike came in his good-looking appearance surprised the king a lot.",
  "father we have fallen in love since the first time we met.",
  "please allow us to become husband and wife.",
  "yes i agree.",
  "now spike didn't have the hedgehog skin anymore he had a happy life with princess mila and other people forever after."
