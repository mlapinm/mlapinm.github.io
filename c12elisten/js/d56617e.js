  "now shall we start with the sightseeing section first.",
  "which places do you guys think they're worth visiting.",
  "how about a lot waterfall guys.",
  "i've never seen a waterfall in my life.",
  "that's true we should put it on the list.",
  "how about the other places.",
  "let's say lavender garden the valley of love.",
  "and other flower gardens.",
  "some people said that when going to dalot.",
  "we should visit a variety of flowers.",
  "that's a good point.",
  "don't you think we should not spend so much time visiting flower gardens.",
  "just write down one garden i'd suggest the lavender one.",
  "then we can have time going to other attractions.",
  "you're absolutely right.",
  "hey you guys may forget the night market.",
  "oh yes and we can move to the next section of what to eat a lot.",
  "the night market would be a perfect place for us to choose what we want to enjoy.",
  "what should we try here.",
  "personally the pizza street here is awesome.",
  "and also the avocado ice cream.",
  "we'd better try them.",
  "yeah the soy milk is delicious too.",
  "wow seems like we have a lot of options.",
  "okay let's talk about the shopping section.",
  "what should we buy in dalot.",
  "i believe that we can buy lots of special souvenirs for our relatives.",
  "in the lot we have lang farm which is really famous for dalots specialties.",
  "yeah and winter clothes end a lot is also another good choice for girls.",
  "i love buying shawls there.",
  "so do i.",
  "well i think it's enough for today's making list.",
  "we can discuss the rest tomorrow.",
  "all right let's start the next lesson then.",
  "it's nearly mom's birthday.",
  "should we do something for her daddy.",
  "of course i haven't had any ideas yet.",
  "do you have anything on your mind at the moment.",
  "i'd say that we should make a birthday cake for her.",
  "it will be more meaningful than buying one in the cake store won't it.",
  "yeah i'm not really keen on cooking in fact i'm kind of bad at it.",
  "also buying ingredients is really expensive.",
  "you're right it is generally accepted that flowers are the best gift for women.",
  "but that's not the same thing at all daddy.",
  "i think after the party the flowers won't be fresh like the first day.",
  "then we have to throw it away after that.",
  "that's true we should cross out the options cake and flowers.",
  "i think so too wait ah i know i know.",
  "what last week when going to the supermarket with mom.",
  "i saw she was being impressed by a red dress in a female mall.",
  "the dress is not expensive but lovely.",
  "would you like to look at it with me again.",
  "yes i agree i think it's a brilliant idea.",
  "maybe your mom will be surprised as we know what she likes at the moment.",
  "should we buy the birthday cake.",
  "i think we should buy the small one.",
  "because i'm not fond of sweet things.",
  "neither is she.",
  "okay so let's go.",
  "as far as i'm concerned the main cause for water pollution is the amount of wastewater.",
  "which is dumped yearly from factories near local lakes and rivers.",
  "thus resulting in the ocean pollution.",
  "what do you guys think.",
  "i agree with you entirely.",
  "and i'd like to point out that the factory in our area.",
  "also dumps a large quantity of chemical wastes into the local lake.",
  "which leads to the stinky smell.",
  "and affects the whole neighborhood including my house.",
  "you guys are right.",
  "it is considered that the local authority is seriously dealing with this problem.",
  "i'm not so sure about that ms kim.",
  "however as a student personally i think we can improve this situation by some practical actions.",
  "that's just what i was thinking.",
  "in my experience we should raise awareness of local residents to reduce the amount of trash thrown into the local lakes and rivers.",
  "on the contrary nobody will know about the current issue that directly harms their environment.",
  "it is thought that we can even make some posters about protecting the environment.",
  "and hang them in public places.",
  "well i must say that hanging posters in public places is not entirely true.",
  "the local authority won't let us hang anything publicly.",
  "we have to think another way.",
  "hey guys.",
  "how about making a small documentary film about this problem.",
  "it's unjustifiable to say.",
  "that we can have enough budget to make a film sarah.",
  "what i mean is.",
  "all we need is just a phone and set up some scenes to show everyone.",
  "which is considered to be bad behaviors toward the local area.",
  "it is said that people usually watch a video.",
  "rather than listening to some speech about the environmental issues.",
  "so speaking for myself i completely agree with that idea.",
  "yeah we should discuss more about the film project after this lesson.",
  "miss kim.",
  "will you join us.",
  "of course i'd love to support you guys.",
  "okay thank you for your listening.",
  "end your discussion with my presentation about water pollution.",
  "what do you think about the japanese food.",
  "marvelous without a doubt.",
  "i love sushi.",
  "but i don't really enjoy the mustard eating with it.",
  "i don't like it either it's hotter than chili's i suppose.",
  "yeah how about the vietnamese food.",
  "i'd say that they are amazing.",
  "enjoying vietnamese street foods is like a new experience to me.",
  "there were a lot of names of dishes that.",
  "i couldn't remember at all.",
  "the recent one i ate would be Banh Xeo.",
  "do you know it.",
  "uh yeah i tried once.",
  "i love the taste of it.",
  "i'm sorry to disagree with you on that.",
  "the taste of bonzio to me is kinda awful.",
  "oh really how about Banh Khot.",
  "Nahh i would rather enjoy the indian curry then.",
  "ah i know that dish but once when i went to a restaurant.",
  "they made the curry so salty that i didn't really enjoy it.",
  "is that the star restaurant that has just opened.",
  "exactly yeah the food there also has different tastes from country to country.",
  "that's different.",
  "i think their menu isn't very various in terms of global cuisine.",
  "all right how about the food in the usa.",
  "well they are famous for fast food right kfc mcdonald's and so on.",
  "i don't really agree.",
  "they also serve other dishes.",
  "and apple pies is a must try.",
  "do you know it.",
  "well that is an interesting fact.",
  "yeah the cuisine around the world is really amazing and different people have different taste.",
