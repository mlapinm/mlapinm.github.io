  "What if you died tomorrow?.",
  "How would the bank get its money back?.",
  "Hear that, Shirley? Your son don't care if I was to drop down dead tomorrow.",
  "I never said that.",
  "All he's concerned about is the bank getting its money back.",
  "Well, he got a point. How would the bank get their money back?.",
  "What? All right, I'll tell you.",

  "You pay off the bank, you get a huge lump sum,.",

  "Listen... I'm sorry.",
  "Sit down.",
  "How did he die?.",
  "With a smile on his face, bless him.",

  "\"As you can see, me dead.",
  "\"When the doctor told me that me heart getting weak,.",

  "\"'or you can carry on the way you've always done and go out with a bang.'.",
  "\"I decided to do both.",
  "\"I'm going to take it lying down with Amy and go out with a bang.",
  "\"I know things between me and you have not been the same.",
  "\"since I borrowed your money.\".",

  "How did you guess? Is nice, eh?.",
  "What you doing here?.",
  "You doing exercise now?.",
  "Who, me? Exercise? You must be mad.",
  "You know, I have a theory about joggers.",
  "The men don't like their wives and the women joggers are secretaries.",
  "They jog to practise, so when the men run off with the secretaries, their wives can't catch them.",
  "Sweetsticks is dead.",
  "Good.",
  "He was a no-good, selfish, womanising, two-timing, money-grabbing...",
  "Did your mother never tell you to speak good about the dead?.",
  "She did. He's dead? Good.",
  "You sure he dead? You know what he's like.",
  "This might be another one of his schemes to get out from paying for his own funeral.",
  "No, he's dead.",
  "He was all right, really.",
  "It was just that he was a liar and a cheat.",
  "- Apart from that, you could trust him.",
  "- Trust him?.",
  "Yeah, you could trust him to lie and trust him to cheat.",
  "Why, the trouble he used to get us into.",
  "Remember that gig in that hotel in '62?.",

  "Well, we still couldn't play them.",
  "- How did he die?.",
  "- Heart attack.",
  "The funeral's tomorrow, St Paul's.",
  "Tell me something. How come you here every morning these days?.",
  "That's why.",
  "- A secretary?.",

  "- You come in too soon!.",
  "\"And so I say to you, brothers and sisters...\".",
  "Amen.",
  "\"...that Sweetsticks did not falter when faced with death.\".",
  "Praise the Lord.",
  "- \"He looked death straight in the eye...\".",
  "- Oh, yeah!.",
  "I like that.",
  "\"He faced death straight in the eye and said, I'm ready, Lord.\".",
  "\"I'm ready to be received into your bosom.\".",
  "No. He see too much bosom on earth to see more bosom when he get to heaven.",
  "Desmond, he getting buried in a Catholic church, not an evangelist, Pentecostal, let-everything-hang-out church.",
  "Say something quiet, something you don't have to shout.",
  "I ain't gonna say nothing at all.",
  "The man used and abused me.",
  "Well, if you can't see it in your heart to forgive a friend who ask for forgiveness on his deathbed, then I feel sorry for you.",
  "Good night.",
  "- Hm!.",
  "- Shirley?.",
  "What you want?.",
  "It's after one o'clock in the morning.",
  "There's no sign of Gloria yet. She should have been in half an hour ago.",
  "She out with Clark again.",
  "He seem sensible.",
  "The man wants to be prime minister. You call that sensible?.",
  "Come in, Gloria.",
  "Your time is up.",
  "Mum, Dad. Still up?.",
  "No. We fast asleep.",
  "- You're late.",
  "- I can explain, Dad.",
  "You know what happens when you're late.",
  "You're grounded. For a week.",
  "- Dad, I can explain...",
  "- Good night, Gloria.",
  "Why you didn't let her explain what happen?.",
  "She's late and rules is rules.",
  "But there could be a hundred different reasons why she late.",
  "The important thing is she safe.",
  "So you better go in her room now and listen to what she got to say.",
  "Desmond.",
  "Go on.",
  "- Who is it?.",
  "- It's me.",
  "Go away, Dad.",
  "I can't go away. I live here.",
  "I want to talk to you.",
  "I'm sorry I didn't let you explain.",
  "- Makes no difference. I'm grounded.",
  "- Well, it might.",
  "- Really?.",
  "- I said it might.",
  "- What happened?.",
  "- Nothing, really.",
  "That's just it. Nothing happened.",
  "Oh, we were supposed to go to this club.",
  "And then we ended up at the town hall at this meeting.",
  "And then everybody back to his place for a meeting about a meeting.",
  "And when I managed to talk to him it was time to come home.",
  "So why were you late?.",
  "I wanted some answers from him.",
  "I wasn't leaving until I got them.",
  "I wasn't gonna stop in the middle of an argument and say, \"Excuse me, I've got to go now.",
  "Same time next week?\".",
  "I'm sorry. You really like that idiot?.",
  "Sometimes you think you know someone, you know nothing about them.",
  "I thought I knew Clark.",
  "I bet you thought you knew Sweetsticks until he ran off with your money.",
  "No. I knew Sweetsticks.",
  "It didn't surprise me when he ran off with my money.",
  "It surprised me when Clark told me he was gay.",
  "Ah.",
  "Well... maybe we can renegotiate your curfew times.",
  "How about, er...",
  "15 minutes for arguments...",
  "30 minutes for break-ups... and an hour for boyfriends who tell you that they're gay?.",
  "Oh, Dad.",
  "Desmond, hurry up or we'll be late.",
  "If you can't finish the speech now, you never will.",
  "Michael, did you write them few words I ask you to?.",
  "- Oh, put it away.",
  "- What's that?.",
  "I asked Michael to write a few nice things about Sweetsticks just in case your father can't manage it.",
  "I'm sure you'll do us proud.",
  "- You finish your speech?.",
  "- Yes.",
  "- I hope you tell the truth about him.",
  "- Yes, I will.",
  "Good. Are you gonna read it at the service?.",
  "I'm going to read a speech at the service.",
  "I don't like the sound of that.",
  "Come on, Mum, cos Lee's been waiting for ages.",
  "Come, Michael, I want a word with you.",
  "What d'you reckon, eh?.",
  "You can't come to the funeral dressed like that.",
  "Look, this is so exclusive.",
  "I've only just got one. Cost me 50 quid.",
  "- It's disrespectful.",
  "- It's dead respectful.",
  "Come on, the motor's running. If you don't hurry up, we'll have to run after it.",
  "Hurry. You know what I mean?.",
  "Hurry, hurry.",
  "Look, about that loan.",
  "Hold on a minute, please, Father.",
  "Hello? Er, yes.",
  "Yeah, look, can you phone me back later?.",
  "Yeah. OK.",
  "Carry on, Father.",
  "I really need it. I mean to build that house back home before I die.",
  "Dad, I don't think I'm the right person to talk to about the loan.",
  "- Why not? You work in a bank.",
  "- Yes, I know, but...",
  "Well, it's just that sometimes people fall out over money, don't they?.",
  "Like you and Sweetsticks.",
  "Oh, come on. I'll drive you to the church.",
  "Desmond?.",
  "Look at all these women.",
  "They should have call him Big Stick instead of Sweetsticks.",
  "He should have left me his address book.",
  "- instead of him sticks.",
  "- Shh!.",
  "Wish I'd met him.",
  "- He could have given me a few tips.",
  "- Shh.",
  "All the tips in the world couldn't help you.",
  "Shh!.",
  "It is our solemn duty... to carry out, in the traditional manner of God's faithful people... the burial of this mortal body.",
  "As we do so, we call trustfully upon God... from whom all creation has life.",
  "May he, in due time, by his power, bring to resurrection with all the saints... the body of this our brother... which, in its frailty... we now bury.",
  "May God unite his soul... with those of all the saints and faithful departed.",
  "May he be given a merciful judgement... so that, redeemed from death... freed from punishment... reconciled to the Father, carried in the arms of the Good Shepherd, he may deserve to enter fully... into everlasting... company of all the saints.",
  "Now... Desmond Ambrose would like to say a few words.",
  "You better not make a fool of yourself or this family.",
  "Tchh!.",
  "Hello?.",
  "What can I say about Sweetsticks that hasn't already been said?.",
  "To many, he was a man of... many talents.",
  "And today I'm standing here on his behalf.",
  "But I'd like to tell you about the real Sweetsticks.",
  "- The man was a cheat.",
  "- Yeah, man.",
  "- He was a liar.",
  "- Yeah!.",
  "And a thief.",
  "I'd like to say that to him but he'd only say to me,.",
  "\"Why tell me something I know already?\".",
  "Sweetsticks was my friend.",
  "I knew him for what he was and I respected him for what he was.",
  "Praise the Lord.",
  "And I only hope somebody up there likes him, too, because they'll be missing out on a damn good steel-pan player.",
  "And to send him on his way,.",
  "I think it only fitting to send him off in the way I know best.",
  "All right, Padre?."
