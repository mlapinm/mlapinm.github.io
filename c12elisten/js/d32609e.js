  "How much longer, Tia?.",
  "Do I have to be here?.",
  "Why can’t I go play with my friends?.",
  "Don’t you want to help me make a delicious cake for mom for Mother’s Day?.",
  "Umm…yes! I do!.",
  "Well, then you must be patient.",
  "We have found almost everything we need.",
  "Okay.",
  "I know that it is tomorrow, Tia.",
  "but why do we celebrate Mother’s Day?.",
  "Mother’s Day has been celebrated for many many centuries and ages.",
  "Ancient Greeks and Romans celebrated it as a festival.",
  "So did the Christian people.",
  "But the Mother’s Day we all have come to know.",
  "and celebrate has a different reason.",
  "Really? There’s another reason for it?.",
  "Yes, and not a very happy story for it.",
  "Why? What happened, Tia?.",
  "First you need to know about Ann Reeves Jarvis.",
  "In the 1900 in the US, before the Civil War.",
  "she started groups like the ‘Mothers’ Day Work Clubs’.",
  "that helped the local women take care of their children.",
  "Later, these clubs came together and did many peace keeping activities.",
  "Wow!.",
  "But the actual Mother’s Day.",
  "did not come about till.",
  "after 1905, when Ann passed away.",
  "Her daughter.",
  "Anna Jarvis decided to celebrate Mother’s Day.",
  "as a way to celebrate the sacrifices moms make for their children.",
  "In May 1908, she had a huge celebration on the day.",
  "with thousands of people joining.",
  "By 1912, everybody was celebrating the Mother’s Day we know today.",
  "I thought you said there was a sad story too behind it?.",
  "Well, as years passed by.",
  "people started celebrating Mother’s Day with a lot of fanfare.",
  "But they forgot that the holiday was not just about gifts and treats.",
  "but about remembering.",
  "and honouring the many sacrifices mom’s make for their children!.",
  "Oh! It just became a holiday...",
  "Yes, exactly.",
  "And Anna Reeves Jarvis spent the rest of her life urging people.",
  "to drop the show and pomp around the festival.",
  "Wow... Her whole life?.",
  "Yes. You know.",
  "she did not even marry.",
  "and dedicated herself to the cause completely.",
  "Just in honour of the lovely mothers all around the world.",
  "You know, Tia.",
  "Tomorrow I will not go anywhere.",
  "Let’s stay at home and plan a great day for mom.",
  "We’ll not let her do any work and will pamper her.",
  "like the way she pamper us every single day.",
  "That’s a brilliant plan Tofu.",
  "Then, let us also buy a few things for breakfast.",
  "and we can make her a delicious breakfast in bed!.",
  "Yes! Let’s do that!."
