  "p05 SPEAK ENGLISH FLUENTLY.",
  "Hey today.",
  "I'm going to teach you five secrets.",
  "That's right.",
  "Five secrets.",
  "You must know in order to speak English fluently like a native English.",
  "Are you ready?.",
  "Well then I'm teacher.",
  "Tiffani let's jump right in.",
  "All right.",
  "Secret number one, the first secret to English fluency is understanding that English fluency is not in your mouth.",
  "That's right.",
  "English fluency actually starts in your head.",
  "Now as an English learner, you probably have studied English for a long time.",
  "Which means you've also experienced frustration.",
  "Why am I not able to speak like a native English speaker?.",
  "You've learned tons of vocabulary, words, tons of expressions and so much more yet, you're still not able to speak it's because of this secret.",
  "You see, it's not the number of words, you know, or the number of grammar rules, you know?.",
  "No, instead it's how you organize your thoughts.",
  "English fluency starts in your head.",
  "Let me explain it to you a little bit more.",
  "The first thing is to speak English like a native.",
  "You need to think.",
  "Like a native, it makes sense.",
  "Right?.",
  "You see, as a native English speaker, I remember when I was in high school college, even when I was in grade school, my English teachers taught me how to think.",
  "They taught me how to organize my ideas properly.",
  "That's why I am able to speak English fluently.",
  "So you as an English learner, need to understand how to think like a native English.",
  "It starts in your mind first, you also need to learn how to organize your thoughts and ideas in your head before you speak.",
  "This is something that is key.",
  "You all know that I talk about the five W's come on.",
  "You know them say them.",
  "What, when, where and why?.",
  "Exactly the reason I teach you the five Ws so many times in my lessons is because using the five W's, you will be able to organize your thoughts before you speak.",
  "This is how native English speakers learn, how to think, and then speak fluently in English.",
  "So you must organize your thoughts.",
  "The third thing is native English speakers.",
  "Are taught this in school.",
  "I mentioned earlier, I learned this in middle school, elementary school, middle school, high school and college.",
  "We are taught how to properly think and organize our ideas.",
  "So I want you to stop being frustrated with yourself because it's not that you are not smart.",
  "It's just simply no one has ever told you this first secret English fluency is not in your mouth.",
  "It's in your brain and your mind secret number one, let's move on to secret.",
  "Number two, this is again, very important for you to understand in order to speak English.",
  "Secret number two is book English will not.",
  "It won't help you speak real English book.",
  "English is actually different from spoken English.",
  "Now, maybe you're like teacher Tiffani.",
  "Oh my goodness.",
  "If I can't speak fluently after studying a book, what can I do?.",
  "Don't worry.",
  "Let me explain what happened to me.",
  "When I was studying Korean.",
  "When I was in Korea, I was learning.",
  "I had tons of books and I was studying hard, but when I would speak to my Korean friends, they said, TIFF, for some reason, you sound awkward.",
  "You don't sound like a native Korean speaker.",
  "Your sentences are not really not.",
  "I was studying tons of Korean books, but I wasn't learning how to speak like a native Korean speaker.",
  "I realized these books, those books at that time were not helping me.",
  "Let me explain how this applies to you as an English learner.",
  "Here's the thing, one reason, many English learners, like you don't become fluent is that.",
  "Only focus on English books like me.",
  "I was only focusing on Korean books, not paying attention to real conversations.",
  "I had my books ready, had them open, and I was memorizing Korean vocabulary words, memorizing expressions, memorizing grammar rules, but I still sounded awkward.",
  "And you again, probably experienced the same frustration.",
  "Only focusing on English books, will make you sound awkward.",
  "Like I sounded when you try to speak English, learning English from real situations will actually make you sound more natural.",
  "Remember I said I was studying tons of Korean books, but when I realized that I sounded awkward and I wasn't speaking Korean fluently, I stopped.",
  "I put the books down and I started paying attention.",
  "When my friends, my Korean friends were speaking with each other.",
  "I paid attention, oh, wait a minute.",
  "They used that expression.",
  "Wait a minute.",
  "They used that word order.",
  "Let me mimic them.",
  "Let me imitate them.",
  "And then all of a sudden, my Korean friend said, Hey, TIFF, you sound more natural.",
  "Your Korean fluency is improving all because I started paying attention to real situations.",
  "That's the second secret book English won't help you speak real English.",
  "If you only focus on the books, you'll never speak English.",
  "So you must pay attention to real situations.",
  "Listen to native English speakers as they speak to each other.",
  "That is secret.",
  "Number two.",
  "Now what about secret number three for English fluency.",
  "This is extremely important.",
  "Secret.",
  "Number three is English conversations have a special flow.",
  "And English conversation is like a tennis match.",
  "I love this secret because I enjoy showing it visually think about a tennis match.",
  "You have a.",
  "And the tennis racket and the person you're playing with your opponent also has a tennis racket.",
  "You throw the ball up and hit the ball to the opponent.",
  "The opponent receives it and then hits it back to you.",
  "And there's this back and forth, back and forth.",
  "Come on, back and forth.",
  "That happens in the tennis match.",
  "That's how a tennis match continues.",
  "Moving back and forth.",
  "English conversations are exactly the same.",
  "There is this back and forth that occurs and I want to explain these points to you really quickly in order going back and forth, which means if you receive a question and you answer it, you must send the question back.",
  "Many times English learners some of my students in the past, I would ask them a question and they've answered.",
  "And then.",
  "They weren't sending it back to me.",
  "This is how a conversation is supposed to flow.",
  "First.",
  "If you understand the proper flow of a conversation, you will be able to go back and forth smoothly.",
  "Remember, we're talking about speaking English.",
  "It's not always about the words and expressions.",
  "If you understand these secrets, you'll be able to speak English fluently, going back and forth next, following the right conversation flow will help you connect with your listener.",
  "You know, one thing that I know you've experienced as an English learner is when a native English speaker.",
  "If you've ever encountered, one comes up to you and asks you a question.",
  "You get a little nervous.",
  "So instead of sending a question back, you simply answer and you get quiet and you feel awkward, right?.",
  "So you're not able to connect to the listener.",
  "So that individual feels like, oh, you don't speak English fluently, simply because you don't understand the third.",
  "The flow back and forth, back and forth of an English conversation.",
  "Understanding and following the flow will also help you sound more like a native English.",

  "But the thing is you speak your own language fluently because you're confident in yourself.",

  "I told you that when I was studying Korean, I was studying so many books, but I still sounded awkward, but eventually I understood the secret and I started paying attention in real situations.",
  "So when I lived in Korea for that 10 year period, I was speaking Korean fluently.",
  "My Korean had really improved.",
  "But now I'm in America, right?.",
  "So I came back to America about.",
  "Uh, it's been a while.",
  "And after being home for a year, one of my closest friends, she was going to get married.",
  "So I had to fly back to Korea.",
  "So there was this one year period where I have not been around any Koreans.",
  "I was not speaking Korean on a regular basis anymore.",
  "So even though I was fluent when I was in South Korea, when I came back to America for that full year, I was speaking in English.",
  "So you, as you naturally think yes, I was probably a little bit nervous and you would be correct.",
  "So I remember getting on the flight to fly back to Korea, excited about my friend's wedding.",
  "I was really excited and on my way to Korea, I realized, Hey, there are certain people that I need to see, not just that friend.",
  "So when I arrived in Korea, I texted some of my other friends saying, Hey, I'll be in Korea.",
  "Let's meet up.",
  "Let's hang out.",
  "Or.",

  "I really care about her and I really wanted to see her.",
  "So I messaged her and said, Hey, I'll be in Korea.",
  "Let's meet up for lunch.",
  "Now we're texting.",
  "You all know, sometimes it's easier to write in English than speak.",
  "Right?.",
  "So up until that point, everything was fine.",
  "I could type, if I forgot a word, I could look it up really quickly.",
  "And I was fine texting her in Korean.",
  "So we met up and we went to a restaurant in Korea and the restaurant had really good food.",
  "So we said, Hey, and again, all in Korean, but again, the introductions and saying the greetings are very simple, right.",
  "Even in English.",
  "Hey, how are you?.",
  "So we sat down to.",
  "And we ordered our food.",
  "And so we started to have a conversation the back and forth.",
  "Now, again, I hadn't spoken Korean in about a year, just simple things, you know, via text and sometimes on the phone periodically.",
  "So my friend was telling me about things that were going on in her life, and my understanding was fine.",
  "Listening skills were good, but again, I had to go back and forth.",
  "I had to respond.",
  "But remember I said, I'm very close to her.",
  "I really care about her and I'm very comfortable around her.",
  "So I feel confident whenever I speak to her in Korean, I'm never shy or nervous.",
  "So the conversation was flowing very well.",
  "I wasn't even noticing it because again, I was so comfortable around her.",
  "I didn't feel insecure at all about my Korean speaking ability.",
  "So we're talking and she stopped and she said, TIFF again, all in Korean.",
  "You're Korean is still good, but you've been gone for a year and I paused and I said, oh, I guess it is.",
  "But then I realized it's because of you.",
  "I said, I'm comfortable around you.",
  "I feel confident around you.",
  "So everything I learned, all the Korean words and expressions came back to my mind and I was able to speak Korean fluently because I.",
  "Confident around her.",
  "She smiled and said, oh, that's good.",
  "And we continued on with our conversation, but I never forgot that situation.",
  "I never forgot what happened because again, I had been gone for a full year, but because I felt confident around her, I was comfortable with her, the Korean naturally flowed.",
  "So I'm telling you this story because I want to encourage you.",
  "Confidence comes before fluency.",
  "When you are comfortable around someone, you'll be able to speak English fluently.",
  "It'll come out more naturally.",
  "I've seen it happen over and over with my personal students, students in the past, even students now they just naturally start speaking English because they're comfortable with me and their confidence improves.",
  "So I want you to think whenever you're speaking in English, if you start feeling a little bit insecure, a little bit nervous, stop I say, wait.",
  "I can do this.",
  "I can do this.",
  "I'm intelligent.",
  "I'm amazing.",
  "I'm learning another language and watch your confidence improve.",
  "And the English will start to flow just a bit.",
