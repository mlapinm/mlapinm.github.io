  "that's 60 seconds.",
  "Miss Abel.",
  "yes Mr fog.",
  "make a note of this unacceptable Behavior.",
  "should I also calculate the time it took for you to fret over it sir.",
  "though Mr Fogg was one of the wealthiest men in London.",
  "no one really knew where his wealth came from.",
  "and this obviously made others gossip about this secretive man.",
  "I heard that he secretly mines gold.",
  "he invites people at home and robs them.",
  "so secretive and quiet was Mr Fogg.",
  "that nobody dared to go talk to him.",
  "uh not that Mr fog ever complained.",
  "he didn't like visitors and other people anyway.",
  "hmm this must be him.",
  "Monsieur apologies I was expecting your help to answer the door.",
  "are you aware that you are a total 65 seconds late.",
  "oh I urgently apologize.",
  "uh again Matthew.",

  "that he was part of the reform Club.",
  "it was coveted by many meaning.",
  "that many people in London desired to be part of this club.",
  "but however it was offered only to the most prestigious and intelligent people.",
  "and everybody at the reform Club was sure.",
  "that Mr Fogg was not a worthy member.",
  "oh it's plain truth.",
  "he is here because of his money.",
  "Philleas is still good to see you lad.",
  "have a seat.",
  "so tell me Mr fog.",
  "what is your take on the current situation on this Suez Canal.",
  "oh let the lad breathe.",
  "he is but the most prestigious and young members of our club.",
  "I am making sure that he is up to date.",
  "so that the name of our club is not pulled down.",
  "because of one wealthy man.",
  "don't pay any attention to him.",
  "he is just bitter because they've decided to up the yearly membership fee of the club.",
  "I am aware that people don't like me here.",
  "but I am worthy of being here Arthur.",
  "you know that.",
  "my ideas and inventions can Usher us into a modern society.",
  "oh really now like your idea of a machine.",

  "can make it possible to go Around the World in 80 Days.",
  "greenwhick enough.",
  "ignore them villius but Mr Fogg wasn't listening.",

  "you will single-handedly bring all of us down.",
  "yeah.",
  "people he is but just a young lad.",
  "he doesn't know what he is talking about.",
  "but I do if one calculates the distance time and the waste of transports.",
  "then with this new route one can travel around the world in 80 Days.",
  "enough.",
  "I've wasted our time and diluted the respect of this prestigious institution.",
  "your membership stands canceled right now.",
  "who's in favor.",
  "Mr Fogg was shocked to see how much he was hated in his own City.",
  "but he refused to give up all right.",
  "let's have a wager then.",
  "a wager.",
  "yes a wager a bet.",
  "to be a part of this prestigious club.",
  "or not should not be decided so easily without any proof.",
  "I will prove that one can second navigate the globe in 80 Days.",
  "that means I Phileas Fogg will travel around the world in 80 Days.",
  "wait it's not over.",

  "Phyllis don't be crazy lad.",
  "oh don't stop him Arthur.",
  "he is a grown-up boy.",
  "he can make his own decisions.",
  "very well Mr Phyllis Fogg.",
  "now that you are so confident about your claim.",
  "I would like to sweeten the deal.",
  "if Mr Fog said seeds in his crazy journey and Returns on the 80th day.",
  "then he shall be named the president of the club for five long years.",
  "now this was interesting.",
  "Mr Fogg very well knew that once he gets to be the president.",
  "that he can finally bring all his inventions out.",
  "the reform Club was run by some strict people.",
  "who surprisingly hated change and reform.",
  "this could change everything.",
  "but remember fog if you fail to go around the world and be back here on the 80th day.",
  "no matter for what reason you lose your house the membership with reform club and half of your wealth.",

  "marzio is that safe i have never traveled into one.",
  "so we will have to find out.",

  "which is why they were rarely spotted.",
  "and mr fogg was not just curious but also a courageous man.",
  "it's either this or them.",
  "there wasn't really a choice.",
  "pacific two hopped in and mr fog cut the anchor rope.",
