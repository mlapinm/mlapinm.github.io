  "Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.",
  "Hector and Annie love each other.",
  "Nick loves babes and motorbikes and Bridget loves make- up, mirrors and chocolate.",
  "Stand by for Extra.",
  "It's time for Can You Live Without...?.",
  "And here's someone you just can't live without.",
  "It's Marty!.",
  "But what Sharon doesn't realise is we've got a camera in the bathroom.",
  "That's disgusting.",
  "She must know that we can see her.",
  "I think it is quite clever.",
  "And what are Paul and Mandy doing in the living room?.",
  "They're kissing. They're kissing.",
  "They're not kissing. They're whispering.",
  "What? Do you call this whispering?.",
  "Let's think of another name for it.",
  "Paul and Mandy said they could live without kissing for 24 hours.",
  "And look, they've failed.",
  "Paul and Mandy lose points for that.",
  "We caught them kissing.",
  "See you after the break.",
  "Can You Live Without...? is sponsored by Clouds Toilet Tissue.",
  "Well, I couldn't live without kissing Hector for 24 hours.",
  "Why don't you try?.",
  "Hector, I wish you'd stop chewing gum.",

  "Well, only when I'm stressed.",
  "-  I've had an idea!.",
  "-  Oh, no!.",
  "We could be contestants on Can You Live Without...?.",
  "We could do it. It's just 24 hours of giving up our favourite things.",
  "It would be easy.",
  "Think of the prize money.",
  "And Marty Ross presents it.",
  "He would come to my apartment again.",
  "-  Oh, no!.",
  "-  Oh, Marty.",
  "He's got such good taste.",
  "And this is fantastic. Original.",
  "What happened to Marty?.",
  "He said he needed time away from me to really appreciate me.",
  "-  So he dumped you, then.",
  "-  He did not!.",
  "Anyway, Bridget, are you feeling persuasive?.",
  "Of course.",
  "I'm always feeling persuasive.",
  "Well, it's time to persuade Marty that we want to go on.",

  "Don't you remember?.",
  "I'm Eunice's researcher.",
  "I research.",
  "I wish I could help you, but it's not my decision, it's the newspapers'.",
