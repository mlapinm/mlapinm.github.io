  "Use a Notebook to Learn More English Vocabulary - Increase English Vocabulary.",
  "Hi I'm Sam.",
  "Welcome to Oxford Online English!.",
  "In this lesson, you can learn what a vocabulary notebook is, why it's useful for learning vocabulary more quickly, and how to use it.",
  "Part one: why should you use a vocabulary notebook.",
  "A vocabulary notebook is a small book where you can record new words.",
  "The best vocabulary notebook is small enough to put in your pocket, so you can carry it everywhere with you, like this.",
  "Remembering new vocabulary is something that many students find difficult.",
  "To really know a word means that you're able not just to recognize it, but to use it correctly.",
  "But how can you go from recognizing and understanding a word to using it well in your English speaking and writing?.",
  "You need to form a long-term memory of the word or phrase you're trying to remember.",
  "When you learn new words in class, or during self study, it's in your short-term memory.",
  "You're able to recognize and even use the word during your studies, and maybe even for a short time afterwards, but then you may forget it.",
  "You need to move the word into your long-term memory.",
  "The only way to do this is to see, hear, and use the word many times.",
  "So then, why is a vocabulary notebook helpful for expanding your vocabulary more quickly?.",
  "A vocabulary notebook is an excellent tool to help you move new words from your short-term to your long-term memory.",
  "You can use it to record and review the vocabulary, enabling you to see, hear and use the vocabulary many times, which will help you to remember it.",
  "But how do you use avocabulary notebook?.",
  "There are lots of different ways to use a vocabulary network but two things are important: record and review.",
  "Part two: how to record the meaning of new vocabulary.",
  "Let's look at recording vocabulary.",
  "When you learn new vocabulary, record it instantly.",
  "That means write it down at that moment.",
  "The physical act of writing it down can help you to remember it later.",
  "So, whether you're in class, studying at home, or out and about, the best thing to do is to record the word when you learn it; don't wait until later!.",
  "There are four easy steps.",
  "The first step is recording words clearly and correctly.",
  "This may sound obvious but many students find they're unable to read their own notes, or they record and then learn words with incorrect spelling.",
  "So, always check how words are spelt.",
  "So, what else do you need to record?.",
  "The second step is to record the meaning of the vocabulary.",
  "There are a number of ways to do this depending on the word or phrase that you want to learn.",
  "Let's use our example, 'soup'. Do you think writing 'pea or chicken' will help you to remember the meaning of this word?.",
  "It's true that pea and chicken are examples of soup, but writing down the meaning like this might not help you to remember what 'soup' means.",
  "However, I'm quite sure most countries have soup, so translation is a quick and clear way to show the meaning of 'soup'. I speak a little Turkish, so I'll use that.",
  "In Turkish, 'soup' is 'çorba' Many students also find that drawing pictures helps them to remember words.",
  "Put the picture on the right-hand page for meaning.",
  "For simple words like 'soup', recording the translation your own language is okay.",
  "However, many words don't have a direct translation.",
  "For this reason it's usually better to record the meaning in English.",
  "But, use your own words; don't just copy the meaning from the dictionary.",
  "This will make it easier for you to understand and remember the meaning.",
  "Let's do an example.",
  "Do you know the word 'tasty'? It describes food that has a strong taste or flavour.",
  "We can also say that this is a positive objective, similar to 'delicious', so we can write a positive symbol next to the meaning.",
  "With adjectives, it's also a good idea to record the opposite.",
  "We can use this sign for opposite.",
  "The opposite of 'tasty' is 'tasteless'. It describes food that has no flavour.",
  "This is a negative adjective, so we can write a negative symbol next to the meaning.",
  "Hopefully, now you have a good idea of how to record meaning in your notebook.",
  "Using a vocabulary notebook is a learning process, and should be personal to you, so experiment with different ways of recording meaning.",
  "But, however you decide to record meaning, one thing is important: it must be clear to you when you come back to it.",
  "So, there are four steps to recording vocabulary: first, record the word clearly and correctly; second: record the meaning.",
  "What's next?.",
  "Part three: how to record the form of new vocabulary.",
  "Ask yourself or your teacher: is your new vocabulary a noun, a verb, an adjective, an idiom?.",
  "Remember that phrases can be nouns or verbs too, so this is true for both words and phrases.",
  "If it's a noun, is it countable or uncountable?.",
  "Make a note so that you understand how to use it.",
  "You can record the form in brackets next to the word.",
  "Here, 'soup' is a noun, so you can write 'n' after it.",
  "'Soup' can be countable or uncountable.",
  "You can show this by writing C/U.",
  "You can put adj.",
  "to show that 'tasty' and 'tasteless' are adjectives.",
  "It's helpful to use abbreviations to record form.",
  "Here are some examples.",
  "n.",
  "is for noun.",
  "v.",
  "is for verb.",
  "C is for countable.",
  "U is for uncountable.",
  "adj.",
  "is for adjective adv.",
  "is for adverb.",
  "Capital 'I' capital 'D' is for idiom.",
  "mwv means multi-word verb.",
  "Abbreviations help you to record form quickly and use less space in your notebook.",
  "So, when recording vocabulary, you should: record it clearly and correctly, record the meaning, record the form.",
  "There's one more thing you should record.",
  "Part four: how to record the pronunciation of new vocabulary.",
  "You're learning English.",
  "That means you know how confusing and irregular English pronunciation can be.",
  "That's why you should record some details about the pronunciation of words.",
  "You could: write the sounds in phonetics, mark stressed syllables, mark any silent syllables or letters, and record any difficult or irregular sounds.",
  "For example, students sometimes confuse the pronunciation of 'soup' with 'soap'. So, the vowel sound here is important.",
  "This is the symbol for the 'oo' sound.",
  "You don't have to use phonetic symbols, but they can help you to remember the correct pronunciation of words.",
  "Vowel sounds are a good place to start.",
  "You can write the 'oo' sound under the letters that make that sound.",
  "The word 'tasty' has more than one syllable, so you should record the stress in the word.",
  "You can do this by underlining the vowel where the stress is.",
  "In 'tasty', the stress is on 'a' Some students may also find it helpful here to record the vowel sound; the vowel sound is 'ay': tasty.",
  "In speech, the second t in 'tasteless' is silent.",
  "You can show this by writing a small cross under the second 't': tasteless.",
  "So, now we have the basic information we need to record.",
  "We've written the word clearly and correctly, and we've checked the spelling.",
  "We've also recorded the meaning, the form and the pronunciation of the words.",
  "You may notice that I've used different colours.",
  "It's helpful to use colour in your notes, and to be consistent.",
  "That means always using the same colour for the same thing.",
  "You could use different colours for different parts of speech, as I've done here: my nouns are black and my adjectives are red.",
  "You could use different colours for verbs and adverbs, too.",
  "This helps you understand and remember the form of the word quickly.",
  "Also, using a different colour for your pronunciation notes helps them stand out.",
  "I always use green.",
  "Finally, you might want to add some information to your notes later, do leave some space.",
  "What else might you want to add?.",
  "You'll see some ideas later.",
  "Part five: remember vocabulary by reviewing and developing your notes.",
  "So, now you know how to record new vocabulary in your notebook, but that's not enough.",
  "You also need to be able to remember the vocabulary.",
  "When you're learning English, you can forget around eighty percent of your vocabulary if you don't review it.",
  "Reviewing vocabulary means seeing it again and using it.",
  "You don't need to spend a long time each time you review.",
  "The most important thing is that you review it many times over time.",
  "Carrying a vocabulary notebook with you everywhere helps you to do this.",
  "Let's make a review plan: imagine you recorded some vocabulary in the notebook today.",
  "How should you review it?.",
  "Research shows that students forget 80% of what they've learned within 24 hours of a lesson.",
  "So, a short time after you've written some new vocabulary down, take five minutes to look at it again.",
  "The very best time to do this is 10 minutes after, when you still remember most of the lesson.",
  "Maybe you're waiting for the bus, or having a coffee.",
  "You can take your notebook out and review the vocabulary quickly.",
  "Read through what you've written.",
  "Remember the meaning, the form and the pronunciation.",
  "Say the words in your head: 'soup' is 'çorba'. Then, test yourself.",
  "You can cover the meaning site of the notebook, look at the words, and see if you can remember the meaning.",
  "Then you can cover the words on the left side, and see if you can remember how to say them by looking at the meaning: 'çorba' is 'soup'. Focus on the pronunciation: 'soup'. Then, uncover the left side and check the pronunciation and the word.",
  "Later that day, when you have a bit more time, you can sit down and add some information to your notes.",
  "Firstly, you should add collocations if you can find them.",
  "A good dictionary will give you collocations.",
  "Use an English learner's dictionary such as Oxford, Cambridge, or Macmillan to find the vocabulary.",
  "What about collocations with 'soup'? We often use words the different types of soup.",
  "For example, 'chicken soup', 'potato soup', 'tomato soup'. We can also say, 'a bowl of soup' or 'a tin of soup'. Write the collocation in the space you left under the vocabulary.",
  "This will help you to remember the word or phrase in the way that it's actually used.",
  "Another good tip is to write sentences using your new words.",
  "The best way to do this to help you remember your new vocabulary is to personalize them.",
  "For example, 'My mum loves tomato soup, but I hate it.' So, at the end of day one, you've found some new vocabulary, you've recorded the meaning, the form and the pronunciation.",
  "You've reviewed it by looking at it again as soon as possible after you first saw it.",
  "Then, you've reviewed it again by looking it up in a dictionary and adding collocations and a personalized sentence.",
  "Congratulations!.",
  "You now have enough information in your notebook to start using it to really expand your vocabulary.",
  "I hope this lesson has helped you.",

  "Balanced English Learning - Improve the Way You Study English.",
  "Hi, I’m Oli.",
  "Welcome to Oxford Online English!.",
  "Many English learners have similar problems, and say the same things: “I’ve been studying for years, but I still can’t speak fluently!” “How can I remember vocabulary?” “How do I stop translating in my head?” In this video, we’ll talk about what it means to learn English, why so many learners have these problems, and what you can do to learn more effectively.",
  "First, have you seen our website?.",
  "Go check it out!.",
  "Oxford Online English dot com.",
  "You can find videos, listening lessons, quizzes and professional teachers who you can study with if you need classes.",
  "Also, one more thing.",
  "Don't forget to turn on the captions if you need them!.",
  "All our videos have captions in English, some have captions in other languages too.",
  "Click the 'CC' button in the bottom right to turn on captions now.",
  "Let’s start with a question: what does it mean to learn something?.",
  "No, really, think about it.",
  "When you say, “I learned this,” what do you mean?.",
  "Actually, it can mean different things.",
  "All learning depends on three things: theory, memory and practice.",
  "You need to understand ideas and concepts—theory.",
  "You need to remember ideas and how to do things—memory.",
  "And, you need to use things in real life—practice.",
  "When you learn something, you need a balance between these three things, and you need the right balance.",
  "If you don’t get the balance right, you’ll find it difficult to learn.",
  "You’ll waste time and energy, and you'll probably get worse results than you could have.",
  "Let’s talk about this balance in more detail.",
  "When you learn different things, you need different amounts of theory, memorisation, and practice.",
  "For example, think about learning to ride a bike.",
  "Do you need theory, or memorisation?.",
  "Not really!.",
  "No one learns to ride a bike by reading books.",
  "You get on a bike, and you try.",
  "You fall off; you try again.",
  "It’s almost 100 per cent practice.",
  "Let’s take a very different example: aeronautical engineering, meaning designing aeroplanes and rockets.",
  "OK, I’ll be honest: I don’t know, because I’m not an aeronautical engineer, but I’m guessing that it’s a lot of theory and memorisation, and less practice, because when you’re designing a plane or a rocket, you should get it right first time.",
  "So, what’s the point?.",
  "When you learn different things, you need a different balance of these three areas—theory, memorisation and practice.",
  "What about learning English?.",
  "Here’s my suggestion.",
  "It’s not meant to be something precise.",
  "This isn’t statistics.",
  "What does this mean for you?.",
  "Many English learners have problems because they get this balance wrong, and they get it wrong in similar ways.",
  "What are the biggest problems English learners have here?.",
  "One: they focus too much on theory.",
  "Two: they try to use theory and memorisation to replace practice.",
  "Three: they leave memorisation to luck.",
  "And Four: they don’t practice enough, or effectively.",
  "These mistakes lead to all the common English-learner complaints: “I’ve been studying for years but I can’t speak fluently!”, “I learn vocabulary, but I can’t remember it!”, and so on.",
  "Let’s see what you can do about these problems, and how you can make your English learning more effective.",
  "In this section, we’re going to talk about the first two problems: focusing too much on theory, and using theory and memorisation to replace practice.",
  "Actually, this isn’t English learners’ fault.",
  "Many people learn English—and other languages—in a theory-heavy way at school or university.",
  "Then, they think this is what language learning means: sitting in a classroom, doing grammar exercises, and so on.",
  "Theory is part of English learning.",
  "Going to a language class might be useful.",
  "Doing grammar exercises can be helpful in the right situation.",
  "But, here’s the key point: practice comes first.",
  "Practice should come before theory.",
  "Using a language is a practical skill.",
  "It’s more like riding a bike than designing an airplane or a rocket.",
  "You can’t replace practice by studying theory.",
  "You can’t learn to speak by doing exercises from a book.",
  "You can’t learn to write essays by reading other people’s essays.",
  "Here’s a question: do you have problems speaking fluently, because you’re translating whole sentences in your head?.",
  "Yes?.",
  "If you do, that’s a sign that you’ve studied English in a way which depends too much on theory and not enough on practice.",
  "If you do this, you end up trying to ‘calculate’ sentences in your head.",
  "That’s really hard!.",
  "It’s like doing complex maths at high speed.",
  "Of course you can’t speak fluently if you’re doing this.",
  "Again, theory is not useless!.",
  "Studying theory is not useless.",
  "But, you have to put practice first.",
  "If you want to learn to speak, you have to speak.",
  "If you want to learn to write, you have to write.",
  "Theoretical study should support your practice.",
  "What does that mean?.",
  "Let’s take something which for many people is the biggest symbol of boring English lessons—grammar exercises.",
  "Grammar exercises can be extremely useful!.",
  "But, you should only do them only when you really need them.",
  "For example, imagine you’re speaking English regularly, but you’re not good at using the present perfect.",
  "You know something about it, and you hear other people use it, and you know that you can’t use it well when you speak.",
  "That’s the right moment to take your grammar book and read about the present perfect and do some exercises.",
  "More generally, you should only study theory—like grammar rules or vocabulary exercises—when you already know what you need.",
  "Don’t take your grammar book, or your vocabulary book, and start at unit one and say, “I’m going to study this whole book!” Have you ever done that?.",
  "I have.",
  "It doesn’t work.",
  "You won’t finish the book.",
  "You probably won’t even finish the first three units.",
  "It’s boring and it doesn’t help you.",
  "Get a good grammar book.",
  "Get a good vocabulary book.",
  "Get books on writing, or IELTS, or whatever you need.",
  "Then, take what you need when you need it.",
  "If you don’t know what something is, then you don’t need it yet.",
  "If you aren’t sure whether you need something or not, then you don’t need it yet.",
  "By the way, I’m not making this stuff up.",
  "It comes directly from my own language-learning experiences.",
  "As you might know, I live in Greece.",
  "My Greek is not that good.",
  "[speak some Greek] I haven’t really studied formally.",
  "At one point, I realised that I didn’t know how to form the past tense.",
  "I knew *some* past verbs, but I couldn’t make past forms which I hadn’t seen before.",
  "Obviously, using past forms is very helpful.",
  "In any conversation, you’ll probably need a past verb at some point.",
  "So, I found some grammar notes, did some exercises, and I learned how to make past forms.",
  "It wasn’t boring or difficult, because I felt I needed it.",
  "And, it helped me immediately, so I remembered most of what I studied.",
  "Here’s a summary: put practice first.",
  "When you feel you need something theoretical, like a grammar point or vocabulary on a certain topic, then go and study it.",
  "You need to feel that you need it, because otherwise it probably won’t stay in your head.",
  "The same is true with memorising things.",
  "There’s no point memorising something unless you know you need it.",
  "Don’t learn a big list of vocabulary which you’ll probably never use.",
  "Go out and practise, talk to people, write something, find out what you can’t say and which ideas you can’t express, and then learn those words.",
  "Let’s move on and talk more about memorisation.",
  "Remember the problem that we said many English learners have with memorisation?.",
  "Too many English learners leave memorisation to luck.",
  "Memorisation isn’t enough by itself to learn a language.",
  "But, it is an important point.",
  "For example, take a topic which many English learners find difficult: preposition use.",
  "Should I use ‘at’ or ‘on’? What’s the difference between ‘to’ and ‘for’? Why do I need to use ‘on’ here?.",
  "Often, leaners approach this like other grammar topics, where you start by learning rules.",
  "But, there aren’t really rules, or at least, not so many useful ones.",
  "Learning to use prepositions is more about memorising lots and lots and lots of information.",
  "You have to memorise specific word combinations and phrases.",
  "Why do you say ‘it depends on’ and not ‘it depends of’? There’s no good reason.",
  "You just need to remember: ‘depend’ plus ‘on’. Many other topics are like this.",
  "They depend more on memory than theory.",
  "If you can’t remember the information, then you can’t use the language correctly.",
  "At this point, you’ll start thinking in your language.",
  "Then you’re translating, which means you’re calculating sentences again, which doesn’t give you good results.",
  "So, memorisation is necessary.",
  "Here’s another point about memorisation: it’s measurable.",
  "A question: imagine you try to learn ten new words.",
  "How many will you remember next week?.",
  "How many will you remember next month?.",
  "How many will you remember in a year?.",
  "What do you think?.",
  "Say a number.",
  "When I ask most students these questions, they almost all say that they’ll remember zero words in a year.",
  "If that’s true for you, then why learn these new words?.",
  "There’s no point learning something if you’re just going to forget it again.",
  "Also, that’s not really learning!.",
  "So, what’s the solution?.",
  "The first part you already know: put practice first.",
  "You won't remember things if you're not using them.",
  "Practice needs to come first.",
  "Don't try to memorise things you don't need.",
  "Just like you shouldn't study theory unless you need it right now.",
  "Secondly: make a system for memorisation.",
  "If you’ve watched our other videos, you might already know what I’m going to talk about.",
  "“Is he going to tell us to use Anki again?” Yes, yes I am.",
  "If you don’t know, Anki is a very powerful digital flashcard app.",
  "It lets you practice with questions and answers on your laptop or phone or tablet, and it’s designed to help you memorise large amounts of information.",
  "I’m not getting paid by Anki or anything like that.",
  "I’m telling you this because I know it works from my experience.",
  "I’ll tell you: I lived in China and I studied Chinese, including writing.",
  "Learning to write in Chinese involves a huge amount of memorisation.",
  "To write at a basic level, you need to know around one to two thousand characters.",
  "I spent three years in China, and at the end I took a C1-level exam, which is equivalent to around band 7 or 7.5 in IELTS.",
  "That meant I had to write essays and other things in Chinese.",
  "So, I went from basically zero to C1 level in three years, and Anki helped a lot.",
  "You don’t have to use Anki.",
  "There are other flashcard apps.",
  "You don’t have to use a flashcard app.",
  "There are other ways to memorise things.",
  "But, you should have a system, and you should ask yourself how well that system works.",
  "Think about the question you saw before: if you try to memorise ten things today, how many will you remember in a year?.",
  "It won’t be ten.",
  "Nothing’s perfect!.",
  "And, that’s fine.",
  "But, it shouldn’t be zero either.",
  "Whatever you do to memorise things, it should work.",
  "The information should stay in your head.",
  "If it doesn’t work, then try something different!.",
  "Or, don't do it at all!.",
  "There's no point in memorising something if you're going to forget it again.",
  "Spend your time on something better.",
  "Don’t leave memorisation to luck.",
  "You don’t have to!.",
  "There are tools you can use.",
  "Also, even if you’re lazy, you should do this.",
  "In fact, especially if you’re lazy, you should do this.",
  "Why?.",
  "Because being systematic about memorisation will save you so much time, effort and stress in the long term.",
  "Many English learners get demotivated because they go in circles, studying the same things over and over and over again; learning and forgetting and learning and forgetting and learning and forgetting… Everyone’s motivation is limited.",
  "If this is you, you’ll give up eventually.",
  "You’ll waste a lot of time and money and energy.",
  "So, be systematic about memorisation.",
  "Measure your results!.",
  "Be a scientist.",
  "Save your time, save your money, and save your energy.",
  "But, remember: memorisation isn’t everything.",
  "The most important thing is practice.",
  "Let’s talk about that!.",
  "You know this already: practice is the most important part of learning English.",
  "Here are some questions many English learners have about practicing: “How do I find someone to practice with?” “Can I practice by myself?” In this section, we’ll talk about effective practice.",
  "I’ll start by answering these questions.",
  "You might not like my answers!.",
  "First: how do you find someone to practice with?.",
  "I don’t know.",
  "You have to solve that problem.",
  "You can make friends with English speakers, do a language exchange, join a conversation group, pay for a language school, or pay for a private teacher.",
  "I don’t know what’s possible for you.",
  "You have to find your own solution here.",
  "I’m not trying to be unkind; it’s just reality.",
  "But, I’ll say this: learning to do anything will cost you time or money or both.",
  "If you have more time than money, then use your time.",
  "Look for English speakers or English-speaking groups online or near where you live.",
  "Or, start your own!.",
  "If you have more money than time, then pay for a teacher or a class.",
  "What about the second question: can you practice effectively by yourself?.",
  "No, not really.",
  "Why not?.",
  "Because effective practice needs feedback.",
  "To be clear, practising by yourself can be useful, but only if you’re also practising with other people and getting feedback regularly.",
  "If you’re *only* practising by yourself, it won’t work.",
  "So, what *should* you do to practice effectively?.",
  "One: practice as much as possible.",
  "Two: practise as widely as possible.",
  "Talk to many people, about many different things.",
  "Write different kinds of texts, on as many different topics as you can.",
  "Three: make sure you have feedback.",
  "Feedback doesn’t have to be formal.",
  "It doesn’t have to come from a teacher, although sometimes that might be necessary.",
  "Feedback can be simple.",
  "For example, if you say something to someone, and they go like this [confused face], that’s feedback!.",
  "It tells you that what you said wasn’t clear.",
  "Four: practice accurately.",
  "Accept that you will make mistakes, but don’t be happy about it.",
  "Try to speak and write as accurately as you can.",
  "Work on your mistakes and your weaknesses continually.",
  "Five: practice repetitively.",
  "Practice repetitively?.",
  "Why?.",
  "Repetition is boring.",
  "OK, I know.",
  "But, it’s effective!.",
  "Many English learners ask “How can I stop translating in my head?” Well, I’ll tell you the answer right now!.",
  "It’s not complicated.",
  "When people ask me this question, I ask them a question back.",
  "Actually, I have a simple conversation with them: “Hello!.",
  "How are you?.",
  "Where are you from?” Let’s try it now together: hello!.",
  "How are you?.",
  "Where are you from?.",
  "Do you have to translate in your head to answer those questions?.",
  "Most people say that they don’t.",
  "Why not?.",
  "It’s because you’ve answered these questions hundreds of times.",
  "You can answer automatically.",
  "You don’t have to think, and you don’t have to translate from your language.",
  "That’s the solution right there.",
  "If you don’t want to translate in your head, then you have to respond automatically.",
  "To do that, you have to practice and repeat the same things many, many times.",
  "So, when you practice, don’t talk about a topic once, talk about it many times.",
  "Don’t practice answering a question once; repeat your answer over and over again.",
  "Don’t write an essay once.",
  "Get feedback, and then write an improved version.",
  "Build repetition into your practice, and you’ll get better results.",
  "I hope this lesson was useful for you.",
  "Thanks very much for watching!."
