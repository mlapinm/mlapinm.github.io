  "How to Understand Fast Speech in English - Improve English Comprehension.",
  "Hi, I’m Oli.",
  "Welcome to Oxford Online English!.",
  "In this lesson, you can learn how to understand fast speech.",
  "You’ll see how to understand fast English speakers more easily.",
  "You’ll also get a simple, step-by-step plan to improve your ability to understand fast speech in English.",
  "Before we start, you should take a look at our website: Oxford Online English dot com.",
  "You can use our free English lessons to practise, including many listening lessons.",
  "You can also take online classes to improve your English with our professional teachers.",
  "But now, let’s see one of the most useful things you can do if you want to understand fast speech better in English.",
  "Imagine a situation: you’re going to the airport to meet someone who’s arriving.",
  "You’ve never met this person before, but you have a photo.",
  "The photo does not look *anything* like the person you’re supposed to meet.",
  "What do you think?.",
  "Will you be able to recognise this person?.",
  "Obviously not.",
  "There’s a similar connection between understanding spoken language and pronunciation.",
  "If you don’t know how to pronounce words and sentences correctly, then you won’t recognise them when you hear them.",
  "More specifically, if you don’t know about the features of native English pronunciation, then you’ll find it difficult to understand any natural speech.",
  "So, what are these ‘features’ of native English pronunciation?.",
  "What should you work on?.",
  "Let’s look at an example: ‘That house looks smaller from the outside.’ ‘That house looks smaller from the outside.’ Even in this short sentence, a lot is happening.",
  "First, the ‘t’ at the end of ‘that’ is generally not fully pronounced.",
  "In British English, it would be reduced to a glottal ‘t’, which means that you start pronouncing a /t/ sound, but you never fully release it.",
  "In American English, the /t/ might also be softened to a /d/ sound.",
  "Next, the words are all joined together.",
  "‘House looks’ sounds like ‘how slooks’. In fact, all of the words are linked, so that the whole sentence is pronounced as one sound.",
  "‘From’ is pronounced weakly, so you say /frəm/ and not /frɒm/. The last two words—‘the outside’—are linked by adding a /j/ sound in the middle: ‘the_/j/_outside’. There are many pronunciation points to be aware of here.",
  "We won’t go into more detail, because we’ve covered many of these points in other videos.",
  "However, here’s the main point: if you don’t know about these pronunciation features, you’ll struggle to understand *any* English speech.",
  "You might feel like all speech is “too fast”. Actually, the speed might not be the problem.",
  "Connected, fluent speech can sound much faster if you’re not aware of these pronunciation features.",
  "You don’t need to be able to use these pronunciation features perfectly, but you should know about them and be able to use them at least sometimes.",
  "Then, you’ll find it much easier to understand native English at any speed.",
  "So, what should you focus on?.",
  "The most important points are weak forms, linking, stress, and schwa sounds.",
  "There are others, but if you have a good understanding of these four pronunciation topics, your listening ability will improve.",
  "Check out our pronunciation videos for more details on these points.",
  "If you want to go into more depth, we can recommend the Pronunciation in Use series of books.",
  "You can find links in the video description.",
  "Working on your pronunciation is the most useful way to improve your ability to understand fast English speech, but what else should you think about?.",
  "There’s a proverb in English: you have to learn to walk before you can learn to run.",
  "In the same way, many English learners who say they can’t understand fast speech also have problems understanding slower speech.",
  "We hope it’s obvious that if you can’t understand slower speech well, then you’ll struggle with faster speakers.",
  "This might sound too obvious.",
  "However, many English learners realise that they have difficulties understanding fast speech, but don’t realise that they also have problems with slower speech.",
  "First, you need to test your ability to understand slower speech.",
  "To do this, you’ll need four things.",
  "One: you need a video or audio file which is not too easy and not too difficult.",
  "English textbooks often have listening exercises which are carefully designed for a specific level.",
  "If you don’t know where to find good listening materials, then use English textbooks as a starting point.",
  "We also have many listening lessons on our website: Oxford Online English dot com.",
  "Two: you need a way to control the playback speed.",
  "You can use a YouTube video, where you can use the speed controls to set the playback speed to point seven-five or point five.",
  "Or, you can use VLC media player, which has speed controls, so you can play something at 90 per cent speed, 80 per cent, and so on.",
  "VLC is probably better, because you can control the playback speed more precisely.",
  "By the way, if you have other suggestions for tools to listen at variable speeds, let us know in the comments!.",
  "Three: you need an accurate transcript of the audio or video.",
  "For example, you could use a YouTube video which has subtitles, or a song where you have the lyrics.",
  "Be careful with YouTube subtitles, as many of them are automatically generated, and these are not generally accurate.",
  "Four: you need a pen and paper.",
  "Your goal is to test how well you understand slow speech.",
  "So, take your video or audio.",
  "Adjust the playback speed until it feels easy to you.",
  "Listen to a few sentences to get warmed up.",
  "Next, pause the playback at the end of a sentence.",
  "Listen to the next sentence, pause the playback, then write the sentence down.",
  "Check against the written transcript.",
  "If you’re using a song, then work in lines instead of sentences.",
  "At this stage, you need to be really strict with yourself.",
  "Double check what you’ve written against the transcript.",
  "Count your mistakes: every missing word is one mistake, every wrong word is one mistake, and every extra word is one mistake.",
  "If you want, try it right now!.",
  "It’s a good experiment.",
  "How many mistakes did you make?.",
  "If you made more than one mistake, then adjust the playback speed down, so that the audio is slower.",
  "Listen to the next sentence and do the same.",
  "Repeat until you find a speed where you can write down the sentence you heard without making more than one mistake.",
  "This is an important step, because you need to build a base for your listening skills.",
  "That means you need to be able to hear every word, and you need to be able to hold a sentence in your head after you’ve heard it.",
  "Again, it’s essential to be strict with yourself and pay attention to small details.",
  "Actually, even making one or two mistakes is a problem.",
  "Your aim is to write down the sentences without making any mistakes.",
  "If you can’t do this even at slow playback speeds, then you need to find something easier to listen to.",
  "Find something which you can understand at 70 per cent or 80 per cent of full speed.",
  "Remember that ‘understand’ means that you hear every word.",
  "It’s not enough for this to understand the general meaning.",
  "You need to hear every single word perfectly.",
  "Take your time on this practice, and get it right.",
  "Once you’re comfortable with this, you’re ready for the next step.",
  "Actually, if you’ve done the exercise from part two, then you’ve already done the most important work.",
  "To understand faster speech, you do the same things, but increase the playback speed gradually.",
  "Listen to one sentence, write it down, and check it carefully against the written transcript.",
  "If you can get three sentences in a row 100 per cent right, then adjust the playback speed up and continue.",
  "On the other hand, if you make more than one mistake in a sentence, then adjust the playback speed down.",
  "You have the same goal: you need to hear every single word.",
  "Try to get to a playback speed of 120% or 130%. If you can hear every word even at these speeds, then find something more challenging to practise with and start again.",
  "For this, you need to be patient.",
  "If you do this regularly, you *will* make good progress, but your progress will not be a straight line.",
  "There will be days and weeks where you don’t feel like you’re getting anywhere.",
  "Don’t give up!.",
  "With any work like this, it’s better to do it little and often.",
  "Start by doing ten to fifteen minutes of practice every day.",
  "Do this for a week or so.",
  "If you’re feeling motivated, go up to half an hour a day.",
  "Don’t try to do too much; doing it regularly is the most important thing.",
  "As with all listening practice, you should try to use a variety of listening sources.",
  "Listen to different sources, on different topics, and with different speakers and accents.",
  "This is the core of your training.",
  "If you do this regularly, your ability to understand fast speech will improve quickly.",
  "However, you have to be consistent, and you have to be strict with yourself regarding mistakes.",
  "Otherwise, you won’t get such good results.",
  "There’s one more point you should think about to understand fast speech better.",
  "There’s a feeling you get sometimes when you’re listening to a foreign language.",
  "It’s that feeling when everything is coming too fast, there are too many words you don’t know, and you’re fighting to keep up.",
  "But, at some point things break down, and what you’re hearing turns into soup.",
  "You know the feeling?.",
  "It’s common.",
  "It’s what happens when there is too much for your brain to process.",
  "There are no quick fixes; there aren’t any magic solutions, and you’ve already seen the most important points you can use to deal with this.",
  "But, there’s one more thing you can do.",
  "Vocabulary is a big part of understanding.",
  "In particular, when you hear a word you don’t know, it often takes your attention.",
  "You start wondering what it was and what it means.",
  "While you’re paying attention to that unfamiliar word, you can’t pay attention to what you’re hearing, so you miss more things.",
  "This makes it more difficult to tune back in.",
  "At some point, you get the ‘soup effect’, and you can’t understand most of what you’re hearing.",
  "This isn’t just about vocabulary.",
  "It also depends on pronunciation and speed, which we’ve already talked about.",
  "It sometimes depends on grammar, too.",
  "So, your listening practice should be supported by language work, especially vocabulary work, but also grammar work if your grammar is weak.",
  "If you hear a word which you don’t know or don’t understand, that will always be a problem.",
  "You can find many other videos on our channel to help you learn vocabulary, as well as grammar if you need it.",
  "Let’s finish with a challenge.",
  "Can you use the training techniques you saw in this lesson every day for one month?.",
  "Try to do at least ten minutes a day, every day for one month.",
  "If you make it, tell us in the comments, and let us know if you feel a difference or not.",
  "Thanks for watching!.",
  "See you next time!.",

  "4 Tips to Help You Learn English - How to Learn English.",
  "Hi, I'm Oli.",
  "Welcome to Oxford Online English.",
  "In this video I'm going to tell you a little about my language learning experiences and I'm going to share with you some things I wish I'd known before I started studying languages.",
  "I really hope you'll find these ideas interesting and useful and you can use them to help you learn English or even maybe another language!.",
  "First, let me tell you a little about myself and why I do what I do, and why I’m making this video.",
  "I was always fascinated by foreign languages.",
  "I remember the first time I went to a foreign country.",
  "I was nine, and I went to Holland.",
  "The thing that I liked best was hearing all of these foreign sounds.",
  "I’d never really heard people speaking other languages before.",
  "Even then, I thought that speaking another language would be a really cool thing to be able to do.",
  "Being able to open your mouth and produce all of these foreign words and actually be understood… That seemed almost like magic to me as a child!.",
  "My Mum bought me a ‘How to learn Dutch’ book.",
  "It didn’t work!.",
  "I didn’t learn any Dutch.",
  "But, I did study French and German at school for many years.",
  "They were always my favourite subjects.",
  "When I was around 20, I set myself a goal.",
  "I would travel the world, and by the time I was 30, I would speak four foreign languages fluently.",
  "I don’t know why.",
  "There wasn’t much logic to it.",
  "It doesn’t seem like the most coherent life plan, even now.",
  "But, that’s what I’d decided to do, so that’s what I did.",
  "I lived in Russia, and studied Russian to quite a high level.",
  "Then, I moved to China.",
  "I studied Chinese, including written Chinese.",
  "By the time I was 30, had I reached my goal?.",
  "Kind of.",
  "I could speak Russian, French and Chinese well, and I could still speak some German, though not so well.",
  "Close enough—I don’t have any regrets.",
  "Anyway, I made so many mistakes along the way.",
  "I got so many things wrong.",
  "I wasted lots of time and energy on things that didn’t work.",
  "There are so many lessons I had to learn the hard way.",
  "So, what were they?.",
  "I remember my first few Russian lessons.",
  "They were bad.",
  "I couldn’t do anything.",
  "I didn’t learn anything.",
  "Why?.",
  "Because I had just graduated from university, and in my head, I was still at school.",
  "When the teacher asked me a question and I got it right, I thought: “Great!.",
  "I achieved something!” I thought this even if I just guessed the answer.",
  "If I got a question wrong, I thought, “I feel bad!” I felt embarrassed.",
  "If we did an exercise or a test, I thought, “If I get a high score, I’ve succeeded!” Worst of all, I thought that just turning up to class was enough.",
  "After all, I wasn’t responsible for my learning.",
  "The teacher was responsible.",
  "That’s the teacher’s job.",
  "I hope, I really hope, that you realise that I’m saying these things because they’re totally wrong, not because they’re how you should think.",
  "Getting a question right or wrong in class means nothing by itself.",
  "Getting a high score in a test means nothing by itself.",
  "Going to five classes, ten classes, or 500 classes means nothing by itself.",
  "There’s only one thing that matters: what have you learned?.",
  "What can you do that you couldn’t do before?.",
  "Teachers can make a big difference, sure.",
  "One of the best teachers I’ve had (Hi Lola!), helped me to change how I think.",
  "Instead of feeling embarrassed about making a mistake, I realised that mistakes are a chance to understand something new.",
  "Instead of worrying about getting things wrong, I started to experiment and play with language.",
  "Instead of seeing tests and exercises as targets for someone else, I saw them as opportunities to express myself and explore my own strengths and weaknesses.",
  "I put this at number one because it’s the most important thing to learn.",
  "It’s the biggest mistake I see English learners making.",
  "I see adults, many of whom are older than me, very professionally successful, acting like they’re still at school, just because they’re in a lesson with a teacher.",
  "I’ve seen people copying their homework from the answer key.",
  "I see people—full-grown, successful adults—really caring about whether they get a question right or wrong in class.",
  "None of this matters by itself.",
  "All of this—questions in class, exercises in your textbook, tests and exams, English courses, certificates—they’re just steps; they’re tools.",
  "What’s your goal?.",
  "To get a piece of paper that says you speak English, or to actually speak English?.",
  "If you start at lesson one and finish lesson 100, is that enough?.",
  "Have you finished?.",
  "Do you want to get a high score in an English exam, or do you want to speak such good English that you never need to take an English exam?.",
  "So, get these old ideas from school out of your head.",
  "Classes, exercises, tests and certificates… All of these things can help you; these things can give you structure and motivation, and that can be important, but they aren’t the end goal.",
  "These things aren’t important in themselves; they’re important for what they can help you achieve.",
  "Focus on what you can actually do.",
  "Because that’s all that matters.",
  "When I first moved to Russia, I was planning to stay for six months.",
  "After six months, I thought my Russian was okay.",
  "But it certainly wasn’t good enough.",
  "I decided to stay longer.",
  "I thought that with six months more study, my Russian would be where I wanted it to be.",
  "After six months, I thought, “My Russian’s alright, but if I just studied for another six months, it would be good.” I studied for another six months.",
  "I thought, “Yeah, my Russian’s not bad.",
  "You know what I need?.",
  "Six months’ more study.",
  "It’ll be really good with another six months.” There were a few more like this, but you can see where this is going, I think.",
  "Even when I left Russia, and I could speak to a high level, I didn’t feel completely satisfied.",
  "It’s not just me.",
  "You never feel like you’ve finished.",
  "You always feel like there’s more to do, and more to learn.",
  "I promise you, this will be the same for you with English.",
  "You’ll never feel like, “I’m done now.” Often, students ask me things like, “How long will it take to get fluent?” “How long will it take to learn English?” No one wants to hear, “Forever!” It’s not a popular answer!.",
  "But, it’s true.",
  "Why is this?.",
  "I think there are two reasons.",
  "The first is that there is always more to learn.",
  "I’m still learning things about English, by teaching, writing and editing other people’s work.",
  "I haven’t finished learning English, just like you haven’t finished learning English, because you never do.",
  "What about the second reason?.",
  "Partly, it’s just human nature.",
  "We focus on what we can’t do, just like we focus on what we don’t have.",
  "What you don’t have is much more interesting than what you already have, right?.",
  "In the same way, what you can’t do seems more important than what you can do.",
  "When you learn something new, it’s satisfying for a very short time.",
  "Then you forget about it.",
  "You focus on what you don’t know; you focus on what you can’t do.",
  "This is natural.",
  "We all do it.",
  "All the time I was studying Russian, I was getting better.",
  "I was learning lots of new things.",
  "But, it didn’t feel that way.",
  "I’m sure many of you who’ve been learning English for a long time can relate to this!.",
  "You study and study.",
  "You learn new things, but you always feel like there’s something you can’t do.",
  "This is how it is.",
  "That feeling never totally goes away.",
  "So, what can you do about it?.",
  "Accept it.",
  "It’s not going to change!.",
  "Also, remember that how you feel isn’t always the best guide to how things really are.",
  "Just because you feel you aren’t getting better, it doesn’t mean you’re not getting better.",
  "It doesn’t mean you aren’t learning anything new.",
  "It’s just how you feel, and how you will feel.",
  "It’s not a reason to stop or get discouraged.",
  "Keep studying; keep working and you will improve, even if it doesn’t always feel that way.",
  "I don’t know exactly when I first got the idea of moving to China.",
  "But, I know when I made up my mind: I read a book called “River Town.” It’s about an American guy who spent two years living in Sichuan, in southern China.",
  "He went there to teach English and study Chinese.",
  "He lived in a small town where there were two non-Chinese people, including him.",
  "I loved the book, and at that moment, I knew: I was going to China.",
  "But, I wasn’t as brave as him.",
  "I couldn’t imagine living in a small town with no other English speakers.",
  "It sounded lonely.",
  "I moved to Shanghai, where there are about half a million foreigners.",
  "I could meet people from many different countries, and mostly my social life was English-speaking.",
  "I wasn’t lazy, though.",
  "I studied hard.",
  "I really wanted to get better.",
  "After three years, my Chinese was quite good.",
  "But, it wasn’t perfect.",
  "There was a lot I couldn’t do.",
  "There was a lot I didn’t know.",
  "Why am I telling you this?.",
  "It’s because my Chinese was a reflection of my life: I chose to move to a big, international city, and I chose to hang out in mixed groups where the common language was English.",
  "So of course my Chinese wasn’t as good as it could have been.",
  "I had a couple of friends who did things differently.",
  "One guy in particular did almost everything in Chinese.",
  "He had Chinese roommates, most of his friends were Chinese, and he worked for a Chinese company.",
  "His Chinese was perfect.",
  "Not just good, perfect.",
  "It wasn’t because he studied harder than me (although maybe he did). It was because he lived his life in Chinese and I didn’t.",
  "I see this a lot with English learners, particularly in English-speaking countries.",
  "Many of the students I meet live in the UK, but don’t speak much English.",
  "They have a community of people who speak their language, and they don’t go outside that much.",
  "I also see this a lot with people saying, “I want to learn English, but I don’t have chances to speak!” To be clear, I know that big life changes, like moving to another country, aren’t realistic for everyone.",
  "I get that.",
  "But here’s the thing.",
  "You can’t separate language learning from the rest of your life.",
  "If you go to class twice a week, and don’t use English or think about English the rest of the time, your progress will always be limited.",
  "Do you want to speak perfect English?.",
  "Do you want to master the English language?.",
  "Yes?.",
  "Then you need to live your whole life in English.",
  "That might not be practical, but even so, improving your English (or any language) means changing your life.",
  "It might mean moving to another country, working in another company, changing your social circle, or other large changes.",
  "And yes, that can be very difficult!.",
  "It can involve making big sacrifices.",
  "I understand that, but that’s how it is.",
  "Language is a part of your life.",
  "The way you live influences what you can learn.",
  "How dare you, Oli!.",
  "I am special!.",
  "I’m not saying you’re not special.",
  "I’m not special.",
  "No one’s special when it comes to learning a language.",
  "Learning English, or any language, is very democratic.",
  "Everyone’s in the same position.",
  "It doesn’t matter how smart you are, how rich you are, how professionally successful you are… None of that really matters.",
  "Let me tell you the last part of my story.",
  "Now, I live in Greece.",
  "I’ve been here for around three years.",
  "If people ask me if I speak Greek, my answer is “Not really.” I can communicate in a basic way, and I understand a lot, but I don’t claim to speak it.",
  "After three years in Russia, I could speak good Russian.",
  "After three years in China, I could speak good Chinese.",
  "So, what went wrong?.",
  "I should speak good Greek by now, right?.",
  "Remember: I’m not special; none of us are special.",
  "I don’t speak good Greek because I haven’t done enough work.",
  "Partly, that’s because I’m busier.",
  "If I’m honest, I’ve also been a little lazy sometimes.",
  "Okay, at this point, I want to say thanks for listening to me.",
  "This is a more personal video, and I appreciate that you’re still watching.",
  "So, let me finish by giving you the secret to learning a language.",
  "That’s right: I’ll give you the secret to learning English, or any language!.",
  "Don’t get too excited—it’s really boring.",
  "YouTube and the Internet are full of people saying they have “the secret to learning fluent English,” or “a way to learn English in ten days.” Normally, the secret is “buy my book – 99 dollars!” I don’t have a book, because I’m too busy to write one, so I’ll just tell you the secret.",
  "You can have it for free.",
  "It’s consistency.",
  "I’ve taught thousands of students at this point in my career, and the picture is very clear.",
  "People who study and work consistently, over time, get the best results.",
  "It’s not necessarily the smartest students who do best.",
  "It’s not necessarily the natural language learners who do best.",
  "It’s not necessarily the most enthusiastic learners who do best, because enthusiasm tends to burn out.",
  "It’s the people who just keep going, who don’t give up, who work and work and don’t stop, who keep going even when it’s hard and boring and they’re not enjoying it: they do best.",
  "They get what they want.",
  "Boring, I know, but it’s true.",
  "So, thanks again for watching and listening to me!.",
  "See you next time!.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7mc1_7E3gY&list=PLD6t6ckHsrubBcsZpswXuda0Hi2m_GJ8U&index=8\">See you next time!</a>",
  "Which English Dictionary is Best for You?.",
  "- We Reviewed 9 Popular Online Dictionaries.",
  "Hi, I’m Oli.",
  "Welcome to Oxford Online English!.",
  "In this video, you’ll see reviews of several online dictionaries.",
  "Which dictionary is the best for English learners?.",
  "Which should – or shouldn’t – you use?.",
  "You’ll find out!.",
  "In this video, you’ll see the pros and cons of nine popular online dictionaries.",
  "We tested the following: Cambridge, Longman, dictionary.com, Collins, Lexico, Macmillan, wordreference.com, Chambers and Merriam-Webster.",
  "If you want the short version here it is.",
  "Are you an upper-intermediate or advanced English learner who wants the most complete, full-featured online dictionary?.",
  "Use Longman.",
  "Are you at intermediate level or below?.",
  "Use Lexico.",
  "Maybe use Lexico even if you’re at a higher level.",
  "You want to know why, or how we tested, or why you perhaps shouldn’t use some of these other dictionaries?.",
  "Keep watching!.",
  "We created six tests for each online dictionary, based around looking up common verbs like ‘talk’, ‘go’, ‘pick’ and so on.",
  "We chose these verbs because they have many different meanings, as well as many phrasal verbs and idioms based on them.",
  "In this video, we’ll focus on the verb ‘talk’. So, what were the six tests?.",
  "The first test was for completeness: does the dictionary give you every definition of a word?.",
  "The second test: does the dictionary give you definitions of phrasal verbs, collocations and idioms related to the word you look up?.",
  "Test three: does the dictionary explain the difference between UK and US pronunciation and usage?.",
  "Test four: does the dictionary explain verb structures and complements?.",
  "For example, you can ‘talk to someone’, ‘talk with someone’, ‘talk about something’, and ‘talk of something’. Test five: can you look up phrasal verbs and idioms directly?.",
  "With some dictionaries, if you try to look up a phrasal verb like ‘put down’, it will redirect you to the root verb, ‘put’. This makes it harder to find the information you need.",
  "Good online dictionaries let you look up phrasal verbs and idioms directly.",
  "Test six: is the information presented in a clear, organised way, and is the dictionary website easy to use?.",
  "This test is more subjective, of course.",
  "Finally, we looked for any other features which might be useful for English learners.",
  "Remember: if you want to see the full test results, check out the page on our website.",
  "If you’re watching on YouTube, you can find a link in the video description.",
  "So, how did our online dictionaries do?.",
  "Cambridge didn’t do very well, which is a shame, because it had been my go-to online dictionary before I started making this video.",
  "Firstly, it is not complete.",
  "It doesn’t contain all the possible definitions of a word.",
  "Plus, it doesn’t have a complete list of related phrasal verbs, idioms and collocations.",
  "On the other hand, for beginners or intermediate learners, there are some good example sentences.",
  "The definitions are well-written and clear.",
  "It does also show the UK and US pronunciation of a word, with audio, so that’s a positive.",
  "It doesn’t clearly show verb complements and structures.",
  "Overall, I can’t recommend it.",
  "One of the biggest problems is that three different dictionaries are combined on one page; there’s a British English dictionary, an American dictionary, and a business English dictionary.",
  "This makes it confusing to use, because different information is in different places, and not always where you might expect it.",
  "I won’t spend more time on it, because there are much better dictionaries you can use.",
  "Longman was number one in our tests.",
  "It’s by far the most complete dictionary I found.",
  "It contained all the information you might need: every definition of the word, possible verb complements, phrasal verbs, idioms… Everything you might need is there.",
  "Not only that, but they have example sentences and many example sentences have audio, at least for some words.",
  "That makes it a great resource for practising pronunciation.",
  "At the bottom of the page, they also have a large number of examples taken from natural English texts.",
  "You can look up phrasal verbs and other word combinations directly.",
  "Even the longer phrase ‘know what you’re talking about’ has its own entry, with dedicated examples.",
  "That’s impressive!.",
  "When you’re learning English, you’ll often hear that you need to learn language in chunks.",
  "This is good advice, so it’s great that there are dictionaries which can help you to do this.",
  "There’s one minor criticism: it gives you the UK and US pronunciations of a word, but it doesn’t clearly show which is which.",
  "For reference, the UK pronunciation is given first, and the US pronunciation second.",
  "Longman also has a number of useful features for English learners.",
  "If you look up a verb, you can find a verb tense table which lists all the forms and tenses.",
  "Finally, it has a good thesaurus, which gives you alternative words and also explains what they mean, and how they’re different from the base word.",
  "Generally, I found Longman one of the easiest dictionaries to use.",
  "Information is organised and presented nicely, and the page is relatively clean, without unnecessary clutter.",
  "Dictionary dot com isn’t really a dictionary in its own right.",
  "Instead, it collects information from many dictionaries.",
  "In summary, I don’t recommend it for English learners.",
  "It’s reasonably complete, although you won’t find much information on idioms and collocations.",
  "More importantly, the information is not well-organised.",
  "A lot of info is hidden behind ‘see more’ links, but there doesn’t seem to be any logic to what’s hidden and what’s displayed immediately.",
  "Plus, because it collects information from different dictionaries on a single page, the information is divided into different sections, but not in a logical way.",
  "This makes it harder to find what you need.",
  "It doesn’t do a good job of showing related phrasal verbs, idioms and collocations.",
  "You also can’t look up phrasal verbs directly, which is a big disadvantage.",
  "Collins has some positive features.",
  "It scored four out of five for completeness.",
  "It has clear explanations with examples for each definition.",
  "However, a couple of things could be better.",
  "Our test word – ‘talk’ – can be both a noun and a verb.",
  "Most dictionaries will separate the verb and noun definitions, which makes sense.",
  "Collins mixes them together in a list.",
  "It’s not bad, but it seems strange, and I think it could be confusing for some users.",
  "Also, it gives some information about complements and structures, but it’s not so clear.",
  "They highlight the structures used in their example sentences, but there’s no dedicated information on what structures are possible and what they mean.",
  "Finally, like some other dictionaries in our list, Collins tries to combine results from different dictionaries on one page.",
  "I think this is terrible design, because you might not even realise there are more parts to the page.",
  "You see the definitions and explanations, you get down to here, and… that looks like the end, right?.",
  "But, then there’s more: a British dictionary, an American dictionary, and more examples and idioms.",
  "Overall, not bad, but it's not the best.",
  "Lexico is one of the best dictionaries we tested.",
  "I highly recommend it, especially for learners at an intermediate or lower level.",
  "Even if you’re a higher-level learner, give Lexico a try.",
  "Why?.",
  "Because it’s so clear and well-organised.",
  "For example, it gives you one example sentence for each definition, but you can also click to see more if you want.",
  "That’s a really nice feature.",
  "You just need a simple example?.",
  "You can have it.",
  "You want more?.",
  "You can have that, too.",
  "In general, Lexico does the best job of presenting a large amount of information in a logical way.",
  "However, it’s also fully complete.",
  "Only two dictionaries scored 100% in our completeness tests: Longman and Lexico.",
  "Plus, information on phrasal verbs, collocations and idioms is nicely separated, and you can look up longer phrases directly; for example, if you look up an idiom like ‘talk the talk’ directly, you’ll find a dedicated page.",
  "The only negative is that it doesn’t explain the difference between UK and US pronunciation or usage.",
  "Overall, I also found Lexico to be the cleanest dictionary in terms of design.",
  "It’s a great choice for English learners.",
  "Macmillan is slightly different, because it puts different parts of speech on different pages.",
  "So, if you look up ‘talk’, you’ll see definitions for the verb only.",
  "The noun definitions are on a separate page, which might not be easy to find if you’re using a mobile or a smaller screen, because they’re hidden in this ‘other entries’ box.",
  "I don’t think that’s a good point.",
  "Macmillan has some positives: it has good information on verb complements, which is also nicely presented, and you can look up phrasal verbs and idioms directly.",
  "However, it’s not complete, and it doesn’t give any information on UK versus US pronunciation or usage.",
  "So, it’s in the middle.",
  "There are better options.",
  "I knew about Wordreference as a bilingual dictionary.",
  "They have many bilingual versions, aimed at speakers or learners of European languages.",
  "However, they also include a monolingual English dictionary.",
  "Is it any good?.",
  "It has some advantages, but overall, not recommended.",
  "Like dictionary dot com, Wordreference collects information from multiple dictionaries, but this means you have too much information on one page, some of which is repeated, and it’s hard to find what you need.",
  "You also can’t look up phrasal verbs or idioms directly.",
  "If you try to look up a phrasal verb like ‘pick up’, you’ll be redirected to the root verb – ‘pick’. Then, you’ll have to find the definition on the page.",
  "Wordreference does have one excellent and – at least in our tests – unique feature.",
  "For pronunciation, it has audio not just for UK and US English, but also for other regions, such as Ireland or Jamaica.",
  "It also includes some regional UK and US accents.",
  "This is really useful, because actually there isn’t just one UK pronunciation and one US pronunciation of a word.",
  "There are many English accents, in the UK, US and in other English-speaking countries, and it’s good to understand how pronunciation is different in different parts of the world.",
  "So, maybe use Wordreference for the pronunciation audio, but I don’t recommend it as a dictionary.",
  "I’ll keep this short: don’t use Chambers.",
  "Two points: first, they print information in a big block, like you’d find in a paper dictionary.",
  "That makes sense on paper, because you need to save money and space.",
  "On the web, there’s no reason to do this, and it makes it harder to find what you’re looking for.",
  "Secondly, Chambers doesn’t seem to be aimed at learners of English as a second language.",
  "It doesn’t give many examples, nor does it give information about verb complements, phrasal verbs, and so on.",
  "You can’t look up phrasal verbs or other longer chunks directly.",
  "It’s not terrible; it does the basic job of a dictionary, but I can’t see any reason to use it.",
  "Merriam-Webster also doesn’t have much to recommend it.",
  "One major disadvantage: it doesn’t give complete lists of phrasal verbs, idioms or collocations when you look up a word.",
  "For 'talk', it includes four phrases here, but why these four?.",
  "Why not others?.",
  "This seems strange; if you’re going to include some phrasal verbs or idioms, you should include all of them.",
  "There’s no information on UK versus US pronunciation or usage.",
  "There’s also no information on verb complements.",
  "They give examples, but the examples aren’t full sentences, making them less useful.",
  "Finally, the design is weird.",
  "There are all these colons and slashes in odd places.",
  "Maybe that doesn’t bother you, but I found it unnecessary and a little confusing.",
  "On the other hand, you can look up phrasal verbs and idioms directly.",
  "Also, it has real-life examples which are pulled from the internet, although they aren’t always accurately classified.",
  "For example, some of the examples for ‘talk’ as a verb are actually the noun form.",
  "Having reviewed these dictionaries, I’ve switched my go-to online dictionary from Cambridge to Longman and Lexico.",
  "Honestly, I was surprised at how badly Cambridge came out of these tests.",
  "Although I think Longman is the best, I would actually recommend Lexico for most purposes.",
  "It gives you complete information, and it’s so easy to use.",
  "What about you?.",
  "Which dictionary do you use?.",
  "Are you planning to switch to a new one?.",
  "Do you have anything to add to our reviews?.",
  "Let us know in the comments!.",
  "Thanks for watching!.",

  "How to Improve Your English Reading Skills - 4 Steps to Improve Now!. Hi, I’m Stephanie.",
  "Welcome to Oxford Online English!.",
  "In this lesson, you can learn how to improve your reading skills in English.",
  "We’ll show you the number one mistake English learners make when they try to practice their reading in English, and how to avoid it.",
  "You’ll see a step-by-step plan that you can use to improve your English reading skills, and we’ll give you several suggestions to improve your English reading level more quickly and efficiently.",
  "You heard just now that there’s one big mistake that many English learners make when trying to practice reading.",
  "So, what is it, and how can you avoid it?.",
  "Here’s a situation.",
  "Think about whether you’ve been here before.",
  "You start reading something in English.",
  "You can’t understand a lot of it, and there are many unknown words.",
  "You start looking up every word you don’t know in a dictionary.",
  "Thirty minutes later, you’re either asleep, or you’ve read about two paragraphs.",
  "Of course, this makes you feel bad, and you start feeling that you can’t read in English, that it’s too difficult, and so on.",
  "But, this isn’t true!.",
  "You can read in English and you can improve, whatever your English level now.",
  "What’s the key?.",
  "You need to select materials at the right level.",
  "Often, people try to read the same things they would read in their native language.",
  "But, if your English level is intermediate, like many of the learners we meet, then you need to accept that you can’t read all the same things in English that you would read in your own language.",
  "If you try, you’ll probably feel frustrated, and maybe give up.",
  "So, it’s essential to select reading materials that are the right level for your English abilities now.",
  "But, how can you do that?.",
  "Here are some tests you can use: One: can you understand the general meaning of the text without using a dictionary?.",
  "Two: can you understand the general meaning of most sentences without using a dictionary?.",
  "Three: can you read the text at a reasonable speed?.",
  "This is subjective, but it shouldn’t take an hour to read a few paragraphs.",
  "If you can’t answer ‘yes’ to these questions, then the text is probably too hard.",
  "Of course, you don’t want it to be too easy, either!.",
  "If you can understand everything first time, it’s probably too easy.",
  "There should be some words and ideas which aren’t easy to understand.",
  "You’re probably thinking: so where can I find suitable reading materials?.",
  "That’s a hard question to answer, because this depends on your level, your study goals, and your personal tastes.",
  "Here’s one suggestion: look for Graded readers.",
  "Graded readers are books adapted specially for English learners.",
  "They take famous stories, or even things like Shakespeare plays, and adapt them for different levels.",
  "Naturally, there are many other sources of English reading materials: news websites, magazines, blogs, forums, books, journals, and so on.",
  "However, whatever you read, it should pass these tests.",
  "You should be able to read and understand most of the general ideas without using a dictionary or spending hours reading a short text.",
  "If you can get this right, then you’ve done the most important work.",
  "Remember that you don’t have to finish reading everything you start.",
  "For this lesson, we’re talking about reading in order to improve your English level.",
  "To do this, you need to find the right materials at the right level.",
  "Don’t waste your time trying to read things which are much too difficult.",
  "So, what’s the next step?.",
  "Let’s get one thing clear: improving your reading skills in English is going to take a lot of time.",
  "It’s not something you can do in days or weeks.",
  "There aren’t any tricks which can help you to improve faster.",
  "So, the best thing you can do is very simple: read as much as possible.",
  "Spend as much time reading in English as you can.",
  "Also, variety is important in your reading practice.",
  "If you read the same kind of texts again and again, you’ll get good at reading that kind of text.",
  "For example, if you only ever read news articles about economics, you’ll get very good at reading news articles about economics, but you might find it difficult to read other styles of text on other topics.",
  "If you’ve seen our video about how to improve your listening, then you might recognise these ideas.",
  "That’s because improving your reading and improving your listening need a similar approach.",
  "Let’s make an example reading study plan together, but first, we want you to think about something: how many different things could you read in English?.",
  "Pause the video, and try to think of five different things you could read.",
  "Make them as different as possible.",
  "Ready?.",
  "Let’s make a reading study plan together.",
  "There are two rules: 1.",
  "Do something every day.",
  "If you’re very busy, try to do five minutes a day.",
  "Five minutes is better than nothing.",
  "If you can do ten minutes a day, do ten minutes.",
  "If you can do more, do more.",
  "But, do something, even if it’s just a little bit!.",
  "2.",
  "Do something different every day.",
  "If you read part of a novel one day, read something different the next day.",
  "Also, try to find things you’re interested in, and that you really want to read.",
  "That way, it won’t feel so much like studying, which will make it easier to do regularly.",
  "Anyway, here’s a possible plan for one week: Monday: read 1-2 pages of a short story Tuesday: read a blog post Wednesday: read a BBC news article Thursday: do a reading exercise from an English textbook Friday: read a film review online Saturday: read the comments on an online news article Sunday: read the lyrics to a song Of course, you should make your own plan to suit your own interests and level.",
  "When you’ve made your plan, write it down and stick it on a wall, or on your bathroom mirror, or somewhere where you’ll see it every day.",
  "When you finish each thing, cross it off your plan.",
  "That way, you can track what you’ve done, and feel good about finishing your plan.",
  "On the one hand, it’s good to challenge yourself, so give yourself one or two harder days, where you’re reading more, or reading something more difficult.",
  "On the other hand, be realistic and don’t try to do too much.",
  "It’s more important to make reading in English a long-term habit, so make a plan which you can stick to regularly!.",
  "Next, keep doing this, every day, every week, every month.",
  "You might not feel that you’re getting better, but over time, you will improve.",
  "Now, you’ve seen the most important ideas you need to improve your English reading.",
  "There are a couple more points to think about.",
  "Let’s look.",
  "Here’s a situation: you’re taking an English exam, maybe an IELTS exam.",
  "You have a reading text which is difficult for you.",
  "There are many words you haven’t seen before, and many sentences which you don’t understand clearly.",
  "The clock is ticking.",
  "What can you do?.",
  "Are there any tricks to make it easier to understand the text in this situation?.",
  "Surely there must be some special techniques which make it easier, right?.",
  "Not really.",
  "If you’re reading a text and you don’t know many of the words, that’s a bad situation.",
  "If your grammar knowledge isn’t enough to understand complex sentence structures, then that’s a bad situation.",
  "At that moment, when you’re in your exam and you’re faced with this difficult text, there’s really no good solution.",
  "There are many videos and lessons giving you ‘reading tips and tricks’, including some of our own!.",
  "However, these are only necessary if your reading level isn’t high enough for a specific task, like an IELTS reading exam.",
  "These tips and tricks are ways to deal with having a lower reading level than you need.",
  "Like everything in this lesson, there’s no quick fix here.",
  "To improve your English reading level, you also need to improve your vocabulary and grammar knowledge, and that’s a long, slow process.",
  "But, it’s necessary.",
  "Remember in part one, we said that you should choose reading materials which you could understand most of without a dictionary?.",
  "Now, we need to look at this from the other side.",
  "Often in life, you can’t choose the things you need to read.",
  "If you’re at work, or taking an English exam, you’ll be given a text.",
  "You can’t choose to read something easier.",
  "In that situation, you need to know most of the words in the text already.",
  "If you don’t, it will take you a long time and a lot of work to read and understand the text, and there’s a high chance that you’ll misunderstand parts of it.",
  "So, what should you do?.",
  "Firstly, your reading practice needs to be supported by regular grammar and vocabulary work.",
  "We won’t go into details about this here, because it’s too big as a topic, but if you need advice, there are many free materials and videos on our channel and our website to help you learn vocabulary and grammar effectively.",
  "Secondly, when you read something in English, don’t just read it once.",
  "Read it two, three, four or more times, especially if it’s difficult to understand the first time.",
  "Vocabulary learning depends on repetition, so by reading a text many times, you give yourself more chances to see new words and phrases in context, which makes it easier to remember them.",
  "Thirdly, as you practice and as your reading level improves, increase the difficulty of your reading materials.",
  "This way, you’ll continuously see new words, new phrases, new sentence structures, and so on.",
  "Okay, let’s look at one more useful point you can use to practice your English reading.",
  "Okay, you’re probably bored of hearing that improving your English reading is a long, slow, pro… Okay, okay, you get it.",
  "We’ve told you many times.",
  "The problem with long, slow processes is that they’re often boring.",
  "And, when something’s boring, it can be hard to motivate yourself to do it.",
  "So, how can you deal with this?.",
  "The most important point is something you’ve already heard: read things you’re interested in.",
  "However, there are a few other things you can do.",
  "One idea is to set yourself challenges.",
  "For example, use a timer when reading something and set yourself a time limit.",
  "Try to read the whole text within that time.",
  "Or, get a speed reading app.",
  "There are many available in the Apple Store or Play Store, including many free apps.",
  "These apps display text at a specific speed, so you have to read at the same speed.",
  "As you get better, you can challenge yourself by increasing the speed.",
  "Another good challenge is to read texts without a dictionary or any help.",
  "You shouldn’t do this all the time, because it’s useful to learn new vocabulary when you read, and you need a dictionary for this.",
  "However, sometimes it’s good to practice without any help.",
  "It’s also useful because this is often closer to real-life situations, where you might be under pressure and unable to look up every word you don’t know.",
  "Follow these tips and your English reading level will improve.",
  "Remember that you need to be patient!.",
  "Do you have any good tips to help others improve their English reading level?.",
  "Please share your ideas in the comments!.",
  "Thanks for watching!.",
  "See you next time!.",

  "SMART Goals to Improve Your English Learning.",
  "Hi, I’m Oli.",
  "Welcome to Oxford Online English!.",
  "In this lesson, you’re going to learn about setting goals for yourself in your English studies, and how it can help you to learn English faster.",
  "Setting goals?.",
  "What’s that got to do with English?.",
  "Actually, it’s incredibly important.",
  "Mistakes with goal setting are a big reason why English learners don’t reach their goals.",
  "When we meet new students at OOE, the first thing we do is talk about goals and help students set clear study targets.",
  "We often hear students say things like: “I want to be fluent in English.” “I want to speak English like a native speaker.” “I want to speak without making pronunciation or grammar mistakes.” Here’s the thing: these goals are no good.",
  "If you say things like this, you’ll create problems for yourself.",
  "Let’s think about why that is.",
  "Firstly, these goals are too big, and too unclear.",
  "What does ‘fluent’ mean?.",
  "How will you know when you’re fluent in English?.",
  "Ask ten different people what ‘fluent’ means, and you’ll get ten different answers.",
  "Because you have this goal which is huge and unclear, you don’t know where to start.",
  "You know you want to do something, but you don’t know what.",
  "Even if you do make some progress, you don’t feel like you’re getting closer to what you want.",
  "Then, you feel discouraged.",
  "“Why can’t I learn English?” “Why is my English still so bad?” “Why am I spending all this time studying if my English isn’t getting better?” At this point, many people give up.",
  "But, it doesn’t have to be like this.",
  "There’s a better way: SMART goal setting.",
  "SMART is an acronym; it stands for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, timebound.",
  "To make progress in English, you need to think about your goals.",
  "In this lesson, you’ll learn how to set SMART goals, and how this can help you to learn English faster.",
  "First, let’s look at SMART goals in more detail.",
  "The ‘s’ in SMART stands for ‘specific’. Your goals need to be specific.",
  "“I want to speak English like a native” is not specific; “I want to be able to talk about everyday topics without hesitating”, is better.",
  "“I want to improve my English grammar”—not specific enough.",
  "“I want to learn how to use past verb forms accurately” is better.",
  "Sometimes, you might need to talk to a teacher or an expert to help you make your goals specific.",
  "Alternatively, you might need to do some research to set specific goals.",
  "‘M’ stands for ‘measurable’. There needs to be a way you can check your progress.",
  "So, here’s a better goal: “I want to be able to talk about five everyday topics for one minute without hesitating.” ‘A’ stands for ‘achievable’. Your goal shouldn’t be too easy, but it also shouldn’t be too hard.",
  "If you say something like, “I want to speak perfect English,” that isn’t achievable.",
  "That doesn’t mean you can never do it, but it’s a goal which will take years—or decades—to reach.",
  "You need a goal you can achieve in a relatively short time period.",
  "So, if you have a bigger goal, like “I want to speak English fluently,” you need to break that goal into smaller, more achievable steps, like, “I want to be able to talk about five everyday topics for one minute without hesitating.” Next is ‘R’, which stands for ‘relevant’. This means that your English-learning goals need to connect with other parts of your life.",
  "If you want to improve your pronunciation, think about why you need this.",
  "What will it help you to do?.",
  "What will change in other areas of your life if your English pronunciation is better?.",
  "You need an answer to this, because it’s almost impossible to stay motivated if your studies don’t make a difference in other parts of your life.",
  "Finally, the ‘T’ stands for ‘timebound’. This means you need a time limit on your goal.",
  "You need to set a date where you can say, “I did this!” or “I didn’t do this…” Hopefully, because your goals are specific, achievable and relevant, you’ll be able to say, “I did this!” more often than not!.",
  "So, let’s add a time limit to our goal: Now you know what SMART goals are.",
  "Let’s look at how you can set yourself SMART goals to improve different areas of your English.",
  "Do you want to improve your English speaking?.",
  "Of course you do!.",
  "Everyone we meet wants to speak English better.",
  "Here’s something we often hear from students: “I want to express myself better.",
  "I feel like I don’t have enough vocabulary when I speak English.” Let’s make some SMART goals from this idea.",
  "First of all, what do you want to talk about?.",
  "Everyday topics, like your home, your family, or your hobbies?.",
  "Or, do you want to talk about more abstract or poetic, like history, psychology, or love?.",
  "Choose something.",
  "Everyone’s different, so we can’t choose a topic for you, but choose one for yourself.",
  "Next, make your goal measurable.",
  "Adding a time element is a good way to do this; for example: “I want to be able to talk about Van Gogh’s life and paintings in detail for three minutes without running out of words.” Next, you need to ask yourself: is this achievable and relevant?.",
  "Is this realistic for you, and does it connect to other areas of your life?.",
  "Looking at our example goal—talking about Van Gogh’s life and paintings—the answers will probably be ‘no’! That’s because it’s an example which we gave you.",
  "But, when you make your own goals, you should ask yourself the same questions: is it realistic, and does it connect to other areas of your life?.",
  "If you don’t do this, you’ll waste time working towards goals which are unrealistic or irrelevant.",
  "This will hurt your motivation.",
  "Finally, you need to make your goal timebound; for example: “By the end of this month, I want to be able to talk about Van Gogh’s life and paintings in detail for three minutes without running out of words.” To reach your goal, you may need to set yourself additional, minor goals, such as: “By the end of this week, I will learn the English names of ten of Van Gogh’s paintings.” “By the end of next week, I will be able to describe ‘Sunflowers’ in detail, without forgetting any words.” “By tomorrow, I will have read this English article about Van Gogh’s life, and I‘ll underline twenty words and phrases to learn.” In this way, a big, vague goal becomes specific, and you have clear steps which you can follow to make progress and improve.",
  "Let’s do another example to see how you can use SMART goals to improve your English pronunciation.",
  "Here’s something we often hear from students: “I want to sound more natural when I speak English.” Let’s see how you can take this goal and make it SMART.",
  "Especially with pronunciation and other linguistic knowledge, you might need some help to make your goal specific.",
  "Often, when we teach people pronunciation, they need our help because they don’t really know where to start.",
  "If this is your situation, then you either need help from a teacher, or you need to do your own research.",
  "You need to do something, because a goal like, “I want to sound more natural when I speak English,” isn’t enough.",
  "Let’s see how you could make this more specific: “I want to improve my intonation and stress in English, so that I sound more natural.” Maybe, for you, this will be different.",
  "Maybe you need to learn more about consonant sounds, or long versus short vowels, or syllable stress, or something else.",
  "Whatever your goal, you still need to make it measurable.",
  "This is more difficult with pronunciation goals, but you still need to try.",
  "You could add something like: “I want to study these five units from this pronunciation book on intonation and stress, and practice with the audio until it feels easy.” Then, you need to ask yourself if your goal is achievable and relevant, like you do with every goal.",
  "Finally, set a time limit: “Within two weeks, I want to study these five units from this pronunciation book on intonation and stress, and practice with the audio until it feels easy.” Your time limits should always be as short as possible.",
  "Can you see why?.",
  "You know what happens if you have a deadline far in the future?.",
  "You won’t do anything until the deadline is close.",
  "You need to feel that you don’t have enough time, so that you start working towards your goal sooner.",
  "Let’s do one more example together, to see how SMART goals can help you to improve your English grammar.",
  "Again, let’s start with something we often hear from students: “I want to be more accurate in English, and make fewer mistakes when I speak or write.” What should I do first?.",
  "We hope you know the answer by now.",
  "Hopefully, you’re thinking, “That goal needs to be more specific!” So, you need to know: what mistakes do you make now?.",
  "And, what exactly do you want to learn to improve your grammar?.",
  "Again, maybe you need some help at this point; you might need to find a teacher to show you where you make mistakes, and what you need to study.",
  "Or, you can do your own research to find exactly what to focus on.",
  "However you do it, you need to set a specific goal, like this: “I want to understand the difference between the present perfect and the past simple.” “I want to learn how to write complex sentences, using relative clauses, conjunctions, and adverbials.” “I want to make fewer mistakes with grammar I’ve known for years, like forgetting to add ‘s’ to a verb in the 3rd person present simple.” Next, you need to make your goals measurable.",
  "The best way to do this is in writing.",
  "For example, if you write something for your teacher, and your teacher shows you ten mistakes with the present perfect and past simple, your goal could be: “I want to write a 300-word essay with fewer than three mistakes involving the present perfect and past simple verb tenses.” What’s next?.",
  "You should know the answer to this question, too!.",
  "Hopefully, you remember that you need to ask yourself if your goal is achievable and relevant.",
  "These are questions that only you can answer!.",
  "Finally, set a time limit: “By the end of next week, I want to write a 300-word essay with fewer than three mistakes involving the present perfect and past simple verb tenses.” Again, you might need to set minor goals to help you reach your major goal; for example: “Today, I will study this unit on the present perfect tense, and repeat the exercises until I can get every answer correct.” “Tomorrow, I’ll review the mistakes I made in the last three things I wrote, and make the mistakes into Quizlet cards, so that I can remember them.” This might seem like a lot of effort at the beginning, but it’s worth it.",
  "Once you get used to setting SMART goals, it’ll become more instinctive.",
  "The clearer your goals, the more chance you’ll have to reach them and get what you want.",
  "If you get better at setting goals, you’ll feel a sense of progress.",
  "This will give you motivation and confidence, which will make it easier to continue learning and improving.",
  "Now, we have a question for you: what’s your first SMART goal?.",
  "Share it in the comments, and tell us if you made it or not!.",
