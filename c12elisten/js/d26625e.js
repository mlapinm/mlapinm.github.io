  "once upon a time in this beautiful green jungle.",
  "there lived a couple of close friends named oliver the fox and lucas the wolf.",
  "oliver was a clever fox he was always enthusiastic with his friends in contrast.",
  "lucas was a lazy and greedy wolf.",
  "every day oliver worked really hard in the deep jungle to find food and stored it for a rainy day.",
  "however lucas was so lazy that he didn't want to do anything.",
  "he always stayed in his home and slept all day long.",
  "therefore lucas often starved himself at meals.",
  "feeling bad for his friend oliver immediately gave the wolf a good share of the food.",
  "oliver said.",
  "lucas don't be shy my dear friend you can eat my food whenever you want.",
  "over the past few years i have stored lots of food.",
  "there is also a lot more inside my house.",

  "oh oliver my best friend thank you so much.",
  "then lucas put the apple into his mouth and happily took a big bite.",
  "get used to it lucas continued to be lazy.",
  "he slept all the day.",
  "and just went to oliver's house to ask for the food when the meal time came.",
  "at that time their jungle was ruled by a ferocious lion named ethan.",
  "every animal in the jungle had to obey the orders the lion king.",
  "they were all all afraid of his strength and prestige.",
  "in a beautiful sunny day ethan went hunting outside his kingdom.",
  "suddenly he felt really tired.",
  "then he growled annoyingly.",
  "this weather makes me so uncomfortable.",
  "that's ridiculous i'm the king of the jungle.",
  "why do i have to go out every day to find the food.",
  "why don't i let my subjects show their respect by bringing food to me.",
  "thought so ethan made a new law for all of the animals.",
  "ethan the lion stood on two legs proudly commanded.",
  "from now on each day all of you will take a turn to bring me a delicious meal.",
  "if anyone doesn't comply i will punish him severely.",
  "fox wolf bear squirrel monkey bowed together and said.",
  "yes your majesty.",
  "from that moment the lion king had only to wait for his subjects to bring him the delicious meals.",
  "ethan the lion bited a piece of delicious meat.",
  "he happily exclaimed.",
  "wonderful i don't have to do anything but still have so much delicious food.",
  "however without moving for a long time the lion's body became more and more scraggly and he was much weaker than before.",
  "the lion pondered then angrily said.",
  "so hungry today is lucas the wolf's turn to give me a meal.",
  "and until now i haven't seen him anywhere.",
  "ha that's so insolent.",
  "ethan made an angry roar that was founded throughout the forest.",
  "oliver the fox stood outside the door he surprisingly whispered.",
  "is that the roar of king ethan who has to bring him the meal for today.",
  "lucas was sleeping in his bed the lion's roar resounded lucas the wolf suddenly opened his eyes.",
  "he exclaimed in panic.",
  "oh my god today's my turn to bring a meal to serve the king.",
  "and yet i forgot to do it what can i do now.",
  "lucas was panicked and ran to oliver.",
  "oliver looked at lucas in surprise and asked.",
  "what's the matter lucas why do you look so panicked.",
  "the wolf lucas fearfully pleaded.",
  "oliver please help me or i'll die.",
  "i forgot to bring the meal to serve the king.",
  "the fox oliver thought then comforted him.",
  "do not worry i will give you some food to tribute to the king.",
  "is that okay.",
  "lucas said happily.",
  "oh i'm really lucky to have you my best friend.",
  "without you i would definitely be punished by ethan the lion today.",
  "oliver said with a smile.",
  "you're always welcome lucas.",
  "we are friends we should help each other.",
  "then oliver invited lucas to his house to visit the food storage.",
  "seeing the storage with full of delicious food.",
  "lucas was really covetous he planned to take it for his own.",
  "then oliver the fox gave.",
  "lucas small basket he said.",
  "hurry up and bring it to ethan the lion immediately.",
  "otherwise you will be punished.",
  "lucas startled nodding hastily and picked up the basket.",
  "yeah i'm going now.",
  "so lucas the wolf hurriedly brought food to the cave of ethan the lion with an apology.",
  "lucas stood next to the table with many delicious dishes which were arranged neatly introducing.",
  "your majesty please forgive me.",
  "i was worried about choosing the best food to serve you.",

  "very good you are really devoted to me.",
  "all right i forgive you but there will be no next time.",
  "lucas wolf laughed and flattered.",
  "yes thank you your majesty.",
  "in the future i will definitely bring you many more delicious dishes.",
  "on that very day the chance for lucas to take over the food storage of oliver had come.",
  "when lucas came back oliver was preparing for a long hunting trip.",
  "oliver the fox wrapped a bag crossing his shoulder and a basket behind his back he happily said to lucas.",
  "my best friend please help me to take care of the house while i'm away.",
  "lucas chuckled patting his chest and replied.",
  "don't worry once i'm here no one will be able to enter your house.",
  "oliver the fox happily thanked lucas and started his hunting.",

  "stealing the best food and brought it to the lion king.",
  "ethan just had to sprawl in the cave waiting for lucas to offer delicious food to his mouth.",
  "the lion king was very pleased with lucas.",
  "but because of being in activity for a long time.",
  "ethan becomes weaker and weaker day by day.",
  "until one day he became seriously ill and was bedridden.",
  "the parrot slowly swooped down and perched on a large branch.",
  "he said aloud.",
  "i hereby announce that our king is seriously ill.",
  "he can now only lie on his bed no longer wanting to eat or drink.",
  "anyone who can cure him will be greatly rewarded.",
  "the animals worriedly gossip to each other about this news.",
  "the bear sighed and said.",
  "the lion king always holds a grudge if we do not visit him.",
  "our life will be much more difficult in the future.",
  "the monkey added.",
  "yes if the king is cured he will definitely punish us if we don't visit him.",
  "the squirrel nodded.",
  "in my opinion we should visit the king together what do you think.",
  "the animals all agreed to visit the lion.",
  "then they went to the lion's cave together.",
  "the brave bear was the first one who entered the cave.",
  "meanwhile oliver the fox was still engrossed in hunting somewhere far away he knew nothing about this news.",
  "the bear sadly steps out of the cave.",
  "the monkey squirrel and wolf looked worried.",
  "the bear said.",

  "thank you all for visiting me everyone is here right.",
  "lately i feel really weak does anyone know why.",
  "wolf smirked and said to himself.",
  "if i am able to incite the lion king to punish oliver.",
  "not only will i be rewarded.",
  "but also all of oliver's delicious food will be mine two birds with one stone.",
  "lucas wolf walked up in front of ethan the lion.",
  "he cowered.",
  "your majesty oliver the fox is still missing.",
  "i have not seen him anywhere.",
  "ethan was surprised then he looked around and shouted angrily.",
  "that's right where is oliver the fox.",
  "all species have come and i have still not seen him anywhere.",
  "how dare he not visit me.",
  "the animals all wanted to make an excuse for oliver the fox.",
  "the bear monkey and squirrel looked at each other awkwardly.",
  "then the bear said.",
  "your majesty oliver must have been busy going somewhere.",
  "so he cannot be present yet.",
  "the wolf lucas rolled his eyes cunningly.",
  "then he said.",
  "my lord in fact oliver did not bother to come here.",
  "he said that you were about to die visiting you would only take time.",
  "ethan lyon roared angrily.",
  "call that sassy fox right here for me.",
  "i will let him know who the king of this jungle is.",
  "the bear said angrily.",
  "that wolf is so cunning and malicious he even sold out his best friend.",
  "lucas's wolf grinned evilly licked his lips rubbed his hands and thought.",
  "it is done i am so  clever.",
  "that is also the day oliver returned home after a long hunting trip.",
  "he came to check his storage and found that the food inside had half lost.",
  "the fox oliver exclaimed in surprise.",
  "what happened who has come here to steal all my food.",
  "just as the squirrel passed by he told oliver what had happened when fox was not at home.",
  "the squirrel seriously warned oliver.",
  "the lion is recovering and going out of the cave.",
  "the cunning wolf sold you out.",
  "he told the king that you didn't even want to visit him.",
  "now that ethan the lion is extremely angry.",
  "hurry up and escape immediately.",
  "the fox was amazed.",
  "what lucas sold me out.",
  "no way he is my best friend.",
  "but when bear and monkey both recounted the same story.",
  "oliver was forced to believe it was the truth.",
  "oliver angrily whispered.",
  "yes only lucas knew about my food storage.",
  "he was the one who stole my food not anyone else.",
  "how can he be so cunning and betray me like that.",
  "and for such a long time i still considered him a friend.",
  "and even enthusiastically helped him.",
  "alright i will definitely teach him a lesson.",
  "then oliver the fox calmly went to the lion's cave.",
  "he saw lucas the wolf flattering beside ethan.",
  "then he fully believed that he had been betrayed.",
  "ethan roared in anger.",
  "oliver the sly fox you despised my majesty.",
  "how dare you.",
  "lucas the wolf stood beside delightedly added.",

  "sounds good so what is your remedy.",
  "the wolf lucas hastily discouraged.",
  "sir the remedy is just an excuse for his guilt.",
  "ethan lyon dismissed.",
  "shut up let him tell it all.",
  "lucas wolf nodded quickly.",
  "oliver said.",
  "for a long time you just lay there without moving or doing anything.",
  "so despite being invincible you will still be weaker and sick.",
  "the lion ethan listened and thought and then nodded.",
  "it makes sense for the past few days i've just been lying in a cave and eating the food lucas brought here.",
  "oliver the fox continued quickly.",
  "that's right lucas the wolf flattered you every day.",
  "and brought food to you because he wanted you to be weaker.",
  "so he could overthrow you your majesty.",
  "lucas the wolf looked scared he hastily exclaimed.",

  "no your majesty it's not right.",
  "please don't believe him.",
  "i've always been loyal to you.",
  "the angry lion shouted loudly.",
  "no lucas i won't trust you anymore.",
