  "dialog one.",
  "who will you vote for.",
  "that's a secret I don't have to tell you.",

  "Hollins but he's such an idiot.",
  "I guess you voted for Roberts.",
  "you bet I did.",
  "he's got some plans for real change.",
  "and how do you think he's going to pay for those plans.",
  "there's a budget surplus the government has extra money.",
  "not enough for all his plans.",
  "he's going to raise taxes.",
  "I can pay a little extra if it improves our lives overall.",
  "we'll be paying more than a little.",
  "so what Holland's promised not to raise taxes.",
  "but that doesn't make him a good president.",
  "it makes him an inexpensive president.",
  "he would let me spend my money the way I want to.",
  "on other people.",
  "of course not.",
  "I earned it they didn't.",
  "some people aren't as lucky as you.",
  "so you'll take care of them.",

  "do you think you have all the answers.",
  "at least I'm thinking about the questions.",
  "dialog two.",
  "I bet you're glad your City Council days are over.",
  "you can say that again.",
  "what a headache that was sometimes.",
  "why do you say that.",
  "like Abraham Lincoln said you can please some of the people.",
  "all the time all the people some of the time.",
  "but you can't please all the people all the time.",
  "I think you've got that.",
  "quote wrong.",
  "I think it was full the people instead of please the people.",
  "well if he didn't say it he should have.",
  "there was no way you could satisfy all the people all the time.",
  "that's quite normal.",
  "no matter what you say or do.",
  "someone will always object to something.",
  "I don't.",
  "know why people enjoy political life so much.",
  "it sure must be stressful.",
  "believe me it is.",
  "and I was just on the City Council.",

  "media.",
  "dialog 1.",
  "what are you reading.",
  "oh there's this article in the paper.",
  "I'm not sure if I agree with the writer.",
  "why is that.",
  "I think his opinions about politics are a little biased.",
  "everyone's biased.",
  "a newspaper shouldn't be except for an editorial story.",
  "be realistic some newspapers are liberal some are conservative.",
  "yes well this writer seems to be biased against the President.",
  "and you disagree.",
  "well I would.",

  "well just think about what he says.",
  "keep it in mind.",
  "that's what I'm trying to do.",
  "it's good to read things that you don't agree with.",

  "well just wait until I read another story.",
  "one that supports the president.",
  "dialogue 2.",
  "I don't think this station does such a good job of reporting the news.",
  "I disagree being a news director must be a very stressful job.",
  "what's so difficult about it.",
  "they have to decide which news is the most important in other words what to lead with.",
  "that's what gets the viewers tuned in.",
  "that shouldn't be so hard.",
  "it's what's going on in the words.",
  "not necessarily maybe they want to lead with a less important story that hasn't been reported yet.",
  "and then they have to decide if they're going to do a live interview a still shot or video footage.",
  "there's so much news.",
  "it shouldn't be a problem.",
  "but everything has to be timed down to the second.",
  "the newscasters have to practice their pronunciation of names of international cities and leaders.",

  "their news really doesn't cover my area.",
  "I don't know any people or news items.",
  "I like the editorials in the Star Tribune especially by the guest editor realists.",
  "I've thought of submitting one to them myself.",
  "what on.",
  "my feeling about the zoning laws and regulations.",
  "I don't think the city is doing enough to control urban sprawl.",
  "I agree that would be a good topic.",
  "I think everyone would agree with you on that matter.",
  "not so fast.",
  "have you forgotten about the real estate developers.",
  "they would be as mad as warming if I took some shots at them.",
