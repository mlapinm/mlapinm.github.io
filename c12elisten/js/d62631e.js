  "p05 REAL LIFE ENGLISH SERIES.",
  "Hey today, I'm going to teach you real life English.",
  "That's right.",
  "The English that native English speakers actually use in real life, not just book English.",
  "This lesson is going to help you so much.",
  "Now this is episode five of our real life English series.",
  "Are you ready?.",
  "Well, then I am teacher.",
  "Tiffani, let's jump right in.",
  "Now what I'm going to show you right now is a very beautiful image, but I want to show you the right portion of this image.",
  "Look up top in the right when I see this, I immediately think magnificent, magnificent.",
  "Now I want you to repeat after me magnificent.",
  "Excellent last time after me magnificent.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Now this word magnificent just means very good, beautiful, or deserving to be admired.",
  "Something that is extremely beautiful.",
  "Like the image I just showed you now let's see an example sentence using this word.",
  "Here we go.",
  "They live in an absolutely magnificent home.",
  "One more time.",
  "They live in an absolutely magnificent home.",
  "What are we saying?.",
  "We're saying that their home is extremely beautiful.",
  "So whenever you want to say something is beautiful or worthy of being admired, you can now say magnificent.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Now, let me give you a sentence pattern for this word.",
  "Here's the pattern you can use.",
  "The view from.dot.dot.dot is magnificent.",
  "Again, the view from.dot.dot.dot is magnificent.",
  "Now here's an example sentence using this pattern, the view from my new apartment.",
  "Is magnificent.",
  "Again, the view from my new apartment is magnificent.",
  "Now I want to show you the view from my new office.",
  "It is also magnificent.",
  "That is the view I see every day.",
  "So I can say, Whoo!.",
  "The view from my new office is magnificent.",
  "Now I want you to try to use this pattern, make your own sentence, put it in the comments section.",
  "All right.",
  "So again, we have magnificent.",
  "Now I want us to jump back to this image because we see the magnificent sky, but what about the other portion?.",
  "The larger portion.",
  "In English, I would say expansive, expansive again after me expansive.",
  "There you go again.",
  "One last time.",
  "Expansive.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Very good.",
  "Now this word expansive just means covering a large area, covering a large area, just like we saw in the image.",
  "A large area, a large portion of the sky.",
  "Right?.",
  "So here's an example sentence.",
  "I want you to look at.",
  "We saw the expensive view from the window.",
  "Wow.",
  "We saw the expansive view from the window.",
  "Makes sense right now, let me show you a sentence pattern you can use with this word.",
  "Here we go.",
  "The sentence pattern you can use is the.dot.dot.dot is or was expansive.",
  "Again, we're using a simple pattern so that you can get used to using this word again, the.dot.dot.dot is or was expensive.",
  "Now here's a sentence using this pattern.",
  "The grand canyon is expansive, right?.",
  "The grand canyon is huge.",
  "It's very big.",
  "It is expansive.",
  "Makes sense.",
  "Right.",
  "So one more time after me expansive.",
  "Good job.",
  "Very good.",
  "Now, before we go to the next word, I want to.",
  "I want to see if you're ready for this quiz.",
  "So we have our first quiz.",
  "All right.",
  "Here's the first question.",
  "All right.",
  "Now you are going to have five seconds for this quiz.",
  "So I want you to look at this first question.",
  "Here's the question I want you to fill in the blank.",
  "The woman likes.dot dot houses instead of tiny houses, five seconds.",
  "To one time.",
  "What's the answer?.",
  "Yes, you got it.",
  "Excellent.",
  "The woman likes expansive, very large houses instead of tiny houses.",
  "Very, very good.",
  "All right.",
  "Let me reset the timer and I'm going to ask you question number two.",
  "The food she made was absolutely dot, dot, dot 5 seconds two one time.",
  "What's the answer.",
  "Very good.",
  "The food she made was absolutely magnificent.",
  "It was really good.",
  "This is a really good compliment.",
  "So if you have some good food from a native English, Tell them your food was magnificent.",
  "They'll really be pleased.",
  "All right.",
  "So very good.",
  "Those two we've learned so far magnificent and expansive.",
  "Now I want us to go back to the image.",
  "I want us to look at a different portion of the image.",
  "Let's move closer to where the rocks are.",
  "This looks very serene, serene.",
  "Again, look at me.",
  "Serene.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Last time after me.",
  "Serene.",
  "Good.",
  "Now the word serene just means peaceful and calm marked by utter calm or quietness.",
  "Very peaceful.",
  "Think about walking through the woods and there's a very quiet stream.",
  "You can hear the leaves rustling.",
  "That is a very serene environment.",
  "All right, now let's look at an example sentence.",
  "Here we go.",
  "We enjoyed the serene landscape at the top of the mountain.",
  "We enjoyed the calm and the peacefulness at the top of the mountain.",
  "So one more time we enjoyed the serene landscape at the top of the mountain.",
  "Now, let me give you a pattern, a sentence pattern you can use.",
  "Here's the pattern, the dot.dot looked so serene.",
  "It looked so calm again.",
  "The dot.dot looked so serene.",
  "Now here's a sentence using this.",
  "Man, the sleeping baby looked so serene.",
  "You know what it feels like to look at a baby sleeping, just peaceful and calm.",
  "It makes us feel good.",
  "The sleeping baby looked so serene.",
  "So again, last time after me serene.",
  "Excellent.",
  "All right, now let's look at another part of this image.",
  "If we move our eyes to the right a bit, we see this a reflection.",
  "Reflection again after me reflection.",
  "Good.",
  "Last time reflection.",
  "Good.",
  "Now this word reflection just means the image of something in a mirror or any reflective surface.",
  "Now let me show you the image one more time.",
  "What is being reflected?.",
  "The sun, you can see the sun's rays on the water.",
  "So again, we have the word reflection.",
  "Good.",
  "Now let me give you an example sentence.",
  "Here we go.",
  "They were looking at their reflection in the mirror.",
  "One more time.",
  "They were looking at their reflection in the mirror.",
  "Makes sense, looking at themselves, making sure everything was okay, checking their hair, their makeup, making sure everything was okay.",
  "They were looking at their reflection.",
  "Now, what if you want to use this real life English vocabulary word, here's a pattern for you.",
  "He could see his reflection in the.dot dot dot.",
  "Remember, it's not just.",
  "He could see his reflection in the.dot dot.",
  "This is a pattern you can use so we could say, he could see his reflection or she could see her reflection in the mirror at the end of the hall.",
  "Now we're saying where it's located.",
  "So we made the sentence longer.",
  "Right?.",
  "So again, he could see his reflection in the mirror at the end of the hall, we use this word reflection.",
  "So last time after.",
  "Reflection.",
  "Excellent.",
  "All right.",
  "Now what about this next word?.",
  "So again, we have reflection, but our eyes kind of zoom out and we see the man looking and we have in, or into the distance again in or into the distance.",
  "One more time after me for pronunciation practice, I'll do both.",
  "In the distance.",
  "Good second into the distance.",
  "Excellent.",
  "We use both of these patterns, these expressions.",
  "So this just means to look at, or to look to a place that is very, very far from where you are, although you can still see or hear things.",
  "We can see the sun, but it's very far away, right?.",
  "Just like the man was looking very far into the distance.",
  "So let's look at an example sentence using this.",
  "This man, excuse me, the man, was looking off into the distance again.",
  "The man was looking off into the distance.",
  "Now, what, if you want to use this in a sentence?.",
  "Let me give you this.",
  "The dot.dot could be seen in the distance.",
  "The dot.dot could be seen in the distance.",
  "A very simple pattern.",
  "Now using this pattern, here's an example sentence.",
  "The large boat could be seen in the distance right now.",
  "We could also say again, looking at the image, we could also say.",
  "The sun could be seen in the distance the clouds could be seen in the distance, a very simple pattern for you to use.",
  "Now we have our second quiz.",
  "I need to make sure you understood all of the words and expressions.",

  "He didn't do anything of course, but that fear that someone may have been walking up on me, that fear went away.",
