  "online shopping.",
  "online shopping is getting more popular due to its convenience and the variety of choices.",
  "watch the video and see how different people buy essential things on the internet.",
  "dialogue one.",
  "hello taylor.",
  "oh hi veronica.",
  "what are you doing.",
  "nothing just enjoying the fresh.",
  "air great well i have a favor to ask you.",
  "what is it.",
  "i'm going to a wedding this weekend and i'm thinking of buying this dress online.",
  "really.",
  "yes so i need your opinion because you shop online a lot and you're a fashion expert.",
  "thank you for the compliment uh show me the dress then.",
  "here it's on amazon.",
  "oh it's very cheap that's why i chose it.",
  "you can never get a dress like this at a store with such little money.",
  "but it seems like it doesn't fit your body type.",
  "well i thought that the details are beautiful.",
  "you have a small and nice waist.",
  "meanwhile this dress doesn't even have a waistline.",
  "but i can always use a belt to fix that.",
  "no a belt doesn't go well with a dress like this.",
  "i like it but it's not the perfect one for you.",
  "what a pity i thought i would look nice in it.",
  "a lot of people think that when they buy something online.",
  "and then they get disappointed that's the disadvantage you can't try it on first.",
  "right but online shopping is more convenient.",
  "when you go to into the stores if one shop doesn't have what you need then you'll have to go to another.",
  "you're right but let's find another one scroll down.",
  "what about this one.",
  "it can fit you well but check the review first.",
  "okay.",
  "the comments aren't so positive.",
  "they say that delivery is slow and the fabric is too thin.",
  "understandable the price is way too low.",
  "does this red one look pretty to you.",
  "no it's too sparkly it's going to make you look ridiculous.",
  "well check this blue one.",
  "seems good it's quite simple but formal enough for a wedding.",
  "people love this one too although it's a little more expensive.",
  "quality clothes online are usually expensive.",
  "but it's okay i can afford it.",
  "thank you for your help taylor.",
  "you're welcome have fun at the wedding.",
  "dialogue two.",
  "mark have you heard the news.",
  "i haven't had time.",
  "why they said that all stores will be closed from tuesday.",
  "that's the day after tomorrow right.",
  "yes oh boy i bet it's because of the pandemic.",
  "indeed that's the only reason.",
  "what do we do now.",
  "we don't have that much food left in the fridge.",
  "the worst thing is that we don't know when they will open again.",
  "our dorm should have had a canteen.",
  "well the pandemic was unexpected after all.",
  "but i heard that we can buy groceries online.",
  "are you serious.",
  "of course since the pandemic a lot of people have opened grocery stores online.",
  "i don't know the idea of buying meat or vegetables on the internet seems weird to me.",
  "but that's the only way.",
  "mark is right.",
  "we don't have another choice.",
  "besides usually we still buy frozen meat and packaged vegetables at the supermarket.",
  "yes there's not much difference.",
  "fine but we have to find a reliable shop.",
  "true that's the most difficult part.",
  "also known as the number one drawback of online shopping.",
  "does anyone have experience.",
  "britney might.",
  "she's the one who suggested the idea.",
  "actually no i just saw some people talk about it on twitter.",
  "can you call your mom or dad to ask.",
  "right they probably know.",
  "in my home country there are very few cases.",
  "the shops are still running.",
  "let me call arizona might be in lockdown.",
  "well then you do it.",
  "it's true my mom said that the shops there have been clothes for almost a week.",
  "oh that's really bad it is but the fridge at my home was quite full.",
  "of course it is.",
  "however my mom prepared for everything.",
  "she already had some shops that we can buy from.",
  "that's great well she told me that she's going to send them to me later.",
  "so problem solved.",
  "dialogue three.",
  "mom i want to buy a pair of shoes.",
  "shoes why so sudden.",
  "well i'm about to go back to school and my converse are too old already.",
  "oh yes they are.",
  "but i want to try and buy them online.",
  "really i'm not so sure about that.",
  "why it's more convenient and there are a lot more options.",
  "what if you buy a pair and they don't fit that would be a waste of money.",
  "then we can just return it back to the shop.",
  "how do you know that they will let you do that.",
  "i'll just ask them through messages.",
  "alright that's fine enough.",
  "great can you help me look.",
  "sure.",
  "so i've been liking this pair of boots for a while.",
  "so long they nearly reach your knees.",
  "i know but it looks really cool don't you think so.",
  "yes but they're super inconvenient.",
  "they might take you five minutes to put them on.",
  "wait five minutes.",
  "yes putting your feet into them properly can already be a struggle.",
  "plus i don't think it's appropriate for school.",
  "then what do you think is appropriate.",
  "sneakers perhaps.",
  "i've always worn them.",
  "i need a change.",
  "well you can find a pair of simpler boots.",
  "ankle boots.",
  "yes with a zipper so that it's easy to put on.",
  "then have a look at this white pair.",
  "so expensive that's over ninety dollars.",
  "but they're german if the quality is good i can wear them for a long time.",
  "there are quality boots at a cheaper price you know.",
  "let me look a little more how about this.",
  "fifty dollars not much cheaper but acceptable.",
  "people's reviews say that it's worth the money.",
  "okay but ask the shop if you can return it if it doesn't fit.",
  "we can after that they will deliver a similar pair in different sizes.",
  "good then order it.",
  "finished.",
  "when will they be delivered.",
  "well maybe in five days or sooner i hope.",
