  "and there was only one apple on that tree.",
  "the god really loved his apple tree.",
  "he usually visited the garden to take a look at that tree.",
  "it's so beautiful so wonderful.",
  "it is the tree that you planted and took care of.",

  "be the best and get the sacred apple of the god how great this honor is.",
  "the best in this garden no one is stronger than me.",
  "this is a leopard named maximus.",
  "he was really famous for his strength throughout all the gardens.",
  "maximus used to show his strength by bullying the animals who were smaller and weaker than him.",
  "therefore when hearing the leopard said so the animals quickly and silently left.",
  "that's right in this garden i'm the best.",
  "we don't need to compete anymore.",
  "not likely maximus you can be the strongest but i'm the quicker and the most flexible one.",
  "who who dared to challenge my strength.",
  "that was you sally.",
  "sally was an agile and mischievous monkey.",
  "he jumped from branch to branch all the day.",
  "then threw little seeds at other animals to bully and disturb them.",
  "he even threw the seeds of maximus many times.",
  "at those times maximus had to neglect it.",
  "because he knew that he could do nothing to teach that monkey a lesson.",
  "sally you want to provoke me again.",
  "all right try to register then let's see how i will defeat you.",
  "of course i will let's see bianca i want to register.",
  "okay maximo's the leopard then sally the monkey anyone else.",
  "here pluto the raccoon i also want to register.",
  "maybe my physical strength is not as good as maximus or sally.",
  "but i'm confident with my mental strength and my skills.",
  "pluto the raccoon was really famous for his intelligence.",
  "he was the most clever and skillful animal in this garden.",
  "maximus and sally were both worried looking at pluto.",
  "they all used to be tricked by pluto.",
  "so they had to respect and be afraid of him.",
  "the raccoon made it three there is no one else right.",
  "me here i also want to register.",
  "this was ryan the goldfish who lived in the lake.",
  "maximus sally and pluto were all surprisingly looked at the goldfish.",
  "then they burst into laughs.",
  "a little goldfish without hands and legs also wants to register [Laughter].",
  "who told you he still has little fins and tail.",
  "you cannot stand on the ground.",
  "how can you win this competition.",
  "they're all right you should know who you are ryan.",

  "then the competition will officially begin by tomorrow.",
  "then soon afterwards the competition started.",
  "it was held right before the sacred apple tree in the garden.",
  "the only apple for the winner had been well decorated in the highest branch of the tree.",
  "the god himself hosted the competition.",
  "he was really satisfied when he saw the competitors there under the sacred apple tree.",
  "they were maximus the leopard sally the monkey pluto the raccoon and a really special competitor ryan the goldfish.",
  "today i will hold the competition among all of you.",
  "my favorite apple will be the prize for the winner.",
  "hooray the apple will absolutely be mine.",
  "my god how can i win this competition.",
  "it's easy the first one who can take all the apple tight will be the winner.",
  "right after the rules was announced by the god.",
  "maximus sally and pluto all burst into laugh to ridicule ryan.",
  "have you opened up your eyes ryan.",
  "how can a goldfish climb up the tree and be a winner.",
  "then we have one less competitor.",
  "a goldfish who always lives deep down the water also wants to be the best.",

  "my god i still want to compete.",
  "it's okay ryan.",
  "you have a really strong will let's start.",
  "the competition officially started.",
  "getting the signal leopard monkey and raccoon hurriedly started together they climbed up the tree trying to express themselves in front of the god.",
  "no one wanted to be the loser.",
  "they fiercely pushed and bumped against each other.",
  "pluto the raccoon seemed to be the weakest among them.",
  "he was quickly pushed out of the physical competition by maximus and sally.",
  "the weak raccoon you also want to compete with us.",
  "yes they're too strong.",
  "however after being pushed out pluto had been able to take a palm full of chestnuts.",
  "he quickly threw them up above.",
  "i will let you know my mental power.",
  "maximus and sally were competing fiercely.",
  "then they were hit by the chestnuts.",
  "it hurts that damn raccoon you are annoying too.",
  "maximus was a little bit stronger than sally.",
  "he could reach the highest branch first.",
  "finally i am the winner.",
  "the sacred apple belongs to me.",
  "when maximus thought he could take the apple.",
  "then the arm of sally also quickly reached right behind him.",
  "they fought against each other to get the apple.",
  "the apple is mine i touched it first.",
  "don't even think about it.",
  "at that very moment pluto the raccoon tried to throw a big chestnut at them.",
  "the chestnut hit the apple making it slipped out of maximuses and sally's hand.",
  "then it dropped to the lake below.",
  "leopard monkey and raccoon watched helplessly as the apple was floating in the water.",
  "why did you make it drop to the lake.",
  "what can we do now no one among us can swim.",
  "i don't care i will jump out there to take it.",
  "maximus eagerly jumped to the water.",
  "sally and pluto also jumped after him to scramble however the water quickly sank them down.",
  "help me please i can't swim.",
  "please i can't swim.",
  "please i can't swim.",
  "ryan the goldfish immediately realized the emergency case which needed his help.",
  "he hurriedly jumped down the water.",
  "with his skills on the water.",
  "ryan tried his best to save maximus sally and pluto.",
  "luckily he finally could bring them to the bank safely.",
  "after that the goldfish swam to the middle of the lake.",
  "he could easily take the sacred apple.",
  "and held it up by his fins.",
  "sacred apple my sacred apple.",
  "did we just lose to the goldfish.",
  "my god ryan was just so lucky.",
  "please reconsider.",
  "the god witnessed the story from the beginning to the end.",
