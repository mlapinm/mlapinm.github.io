  "The power of data in business.",
  "As a data analyst, you'll be tackling business tasks that help companies use data.",
  "Coming up, we'll talk more about what a business task actually is, and some examples of what they might look like in real data analyst jobs.",
  "Let's take a second and think back on the real examples of businesses using data analytics and their operation we've seen before.",
  "You might have noticed a common theme across every example.",
  "They all have issues to explore, questions to answer, or problems to solve.",
  "It's easy for these things to get mixed up.",
  "Here's a way to keep them straight when we talk about them in data analytics.",
  "An issue is a topic or subject to investigate.",
  "A question is designed to discover information and a problem is an obstacle or complication that needs to be worked out.",
  "Coca-Cola had a question about new products.",
  "Data analysis gave them insights into new flavors customers already like.",
  "The City Zoo and Aquarium had a problem with staffing.",
  "Data, helped them figure out the best staffing strategy.",
  "These questions and problems become the foundation for all kinds of business tasks, that you'll help solve as a data analyst.",
  "A business task is the question or problem data analysis answers for business.",
  "This is where you focus a lot of your efforts in the work you'll do for future employers.",
  "Let's stick with our zoo example and see if we can imagine what a business task for a zoo might look like.",
  "We know the problem, unpredictable weather was making it hard for the zoo to anticipate staffing needs.",
  "Maybe the business task could be something like, analyze weather data from the last decade to identify predictable patterns.",
  "The data analysts could then plan out the best way to gather, analyze, and present the data needed to solve this task and meet the zoos goals.",
  "Then, using data, the zoo would be able to make informed decisions about their daily staffing.",
  "We talked a little about data-driven decision making in previous videos.",
  "But just in case you need a refresher, here it is.",
  "Data-driven decision-making is when facts that have been discovered through data analysis are used to guide business strategy.",
  "The simplest way to think about decision-making is that it's a choice between consequences, good, bad, or a combination of both.",
  "In our zoo example, the zoo had the data they needed to make an informed decision that solved their problem.",
  "But what if they had made this decision without data?.",
  "Let's say they just relied on observation and memory to track the weather and make staffing schedules.",
  "Well, we already know that wouldn't have solve their problem long-term.",
  "Data analytics gave them the information they needed to find the best possible solution to their problem.",
  "That's the power of data.",
  "Observation and intuition are powerful tools in decision-making, but they can only take us so far when we make decisions based on just observation and gut feelings, we're only seeing part of the picture.",
  "Data helps us see the whole thing.",
  "With data, we have a complete picture of the problem and its causes, which lets us find new and surprising solutions we never would've been able to see before.",
  "Data analytics helps businesses make better decisions.",
  "It all starts with a business task and the question it's trying to answer.",
  "With the skills you'll learn throughout this program, you'll be able to ask the right questions, plan out the best way to gather and analyze data, and then present it visually to arm your team so they can make an informed, data-driven decision.",
  "That makes you critical to the success of any business you work for.",
  "Data is a powerful tool.",
  "With great power comes, well, you know the rest.",
  "And you're doing a super job taking in all of this information.",
  "Up next, we'll talk about your responsibility as a data analyst to make sure you're gathering, analyzing, and presenting data in a way that's fair to the people being represented by that data.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/lecture/lYG5Y/rachel-data-detectives\">Up next, we'll talk about your responsibility as a data analyst to make sure you're gathering, analyzing, and presenting data in a way that's fair to the people being represented by that data.</a>",
  "Rachel: Data detectives.",
  "Hi, my name is Rachel, and I'm the Business systems and analytics lead at Verily.",
  "There are a lot of different types of problems that a data analyst can solve.",
  "I've been lucky enough over my career to have seen a lot of them and to take in a lot of very different types of data and help turn that into meaningful answers.",
  "I think one of the most important things to remember about data analytics is that data is data.",
  "I'm a finance data analyst and so my role at Verily is to take all of our financial information, all of the information of the money we're spending and the money we're making, and turn that into reports and insights so that our business leads can understand what we're doing.",
  "One of the most important things I've done at Verily recently was help create what's called a profit and loss statement for each of our business units.",
  "That means that in real time, our teams can see what their budget is and how they're spending against that budget.",
  "What that does is that helps our teams keep to that budget by either increasing their revenue streams so that they have more money to play with or pulling back their spending so that they can keep themselves within that budget.",
  "All of that really helps keep us on track as a company in making sure that we're hitting our goals.",
  "I found that data acts like a living and breathing thing.",
  "When you have a ton of data points, it can be overwhelming when you first sit down to make sense of it.",
  "You have tons of columns, tons of records, tons of different types of data, and finding a way to make sense of that is really hard and that's where the expertise of a data analyst comes in.",
  "It has been some of the most frustrating moments of my career, but also some of the most rewarding work I've ever done when it finally comes together.",
  "The best advice I have for any data analyst starting out is keep at it.",
  "If the angle you're taking doesn't work, try to find another one.",
  "Try to come at it in a different way, try to ask a different question, and eventually the data will yield and you'll get the insights you're looking for.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/lecture/EU7EG/understanding-data-and-fairness\">Try to come at it in a different way, try to ask a different question, and eventually the data will yield and you'll get the insights you're looking for.</a>",
  "Understanding data and fairness.",
  "So far, we've covered the different roles data analysts play in business environments and the kinds of tasks that come with those roles.",
  "But data analysts have another important responsibility: making sure that their analyses are fair.",
  "Now, I know what you're probably thinking, data is based on collected facts, how can it be unfair?.",
  "Well, that's a good question.",
  "Let's learn what fairness means when we talk about data analysis and why it's important for you as an analyst to keep in mind.",
  "Fairness means ensuring that your analysis doesn't create or reinforce bias.",
  "In other words, as a data analyst, you want to help create systems that are fair and inclusive to everyone.",
  "Sounds simple enough?.",
  "Well, here's the tough part about fairness in data analytics.",
  "There isn't one standard definition of it, but hopefully the way we've just described it can give you one way to think about fairness for right now, but it's about to get a bit trickier.",
  "Sometimes conclusions based on data can be true and unfair.",
  "What can you do then?.",
  "Well, let's find out with an example.",
  "Let's say we have a company that's kind of notorious for being a boys club.",
  "There isn't much representation of other genders.",
  "This company wants to see which employees are doing well, so they start gathering data on employee performance and their own company culture.",
  "The data shows that men are the only people succeeding at this company.",
  "Their conclusion?.",
  "That they should hire more men.",
  "After all, they're doing really well here, right?.",
  "But that's not a fair conclusion for a couple of reasons.",
  "First, it doesn't even consider all of the available data on company culture, so it paints an incomplete picture.",
  "Second, it doesn't think about the other surrounding factors that impact the data, or in other words, the conclusion doesn't consider the difficulties that people of different gender identities have trying to navigate a toxic work environment.",
  "If the company only looks at this conclusion, they won't acknowledge and address how harmful their culture is and they won't understand why certain people are set up to fail within it.",
  "That's why it's important to keep fairness in mind when analyzing data.",
  "The conclusion that only men are succeeding at this company is true, but it ignores other systematic factors that are contributing to this problem.",
  "But don't worry, there's a way to make a fair conclusion here.",
  "An ethical data analyst can look at the data gathered and conclude that the company culture is preventing some employees from succeeding, and the company needs to address those problems to boost performance.",
  "See how this conclusion paints a much more complete and fair picture.",
  "It recognizes the fact that some people aren't doing as well in this company and factors in why that could be instead of discriminating against a huge number of applicants in the future.",
  "As a data analyst it's your responsibility to make sure your analysis is fair and factors in the complicated social context that could create bias in your conclusions.",
  "It's important to think about fairness from the moment you start collecting data for a business task to the time you present your conclusions to your stakeholders.",
  "We'll learn more about bias in the data analysis process later on in another course.",
  "For now, let's check out an example of a data analysis that does a good job of considering fairness in its conclusion.",
  "A team of Harvard data scientists were developing a mobile platform to track patients at risk of cardiovascular disease in an area of the United States called the Stroke Belt.",
  "It's important to call out that there were a variety of reasons people living in this area might be more at risk.",
  "With that in mind, these data scientists recognized that fairness needed to be a priority for this project, so they built fairness into their models.",
  "The team took several fairness measures to make sure they were being as fair as possible when examining sensitive and potentially biased data.",
  "First, they teamed analysts with social scientists who could provide insights on human bias and the social context that created them.",
  "They also collected self reported data in a separate system to avoid the potential for racial bias, which might skew the results of their study and unfairly represent patients.",
  "To make sure this sample population was representative, they oversampled non-dominant groups to ensure the model was including them.",
  "It's clear that the team made fairness a top priority every step of the way.",
  "This helped them collect data and create conclusions that didn't negatively impact the communities they were studying.",
  "Hopefully these examples have given you a better idea of what fairness means in data analysis.",
  "But we're going to keep building on our understanding of fairness throughout this program and you'll get to practice with some activities.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/lecture/OEY5B/alex-fair-and-ethical-data-decisions\">But we're going to keep building on our understanding of fairness throughout this program and you'll get to practice with some activities.</a>",
  "Alex: Fair and ethical data decisions.",
  "Hi, I'm Alex.",
  "I'm a research scientist at Google.",
  "My team is called the ethical AI team, we're a group of folks that really are concerned not only about how AI the technology operates, but how it interacts with society and how it might help or harm marginalized communities.",
  "When we talk about data ethics, we think about what is the good and right way of using data?.",
  "What are going to be ways that uses of data are going to be beneficial to people?.",
  "When it comes to data ethics, it's not just about minimizing harm but it's actually this concept of beneficence.",
  "How do we actually improve the lives of people by using data?.",
  "When we think about data ethics we're thinking about, who's collecting the data?.",
  "Why are they collecting it?.",
  "How are they collecting it and for what purpose?.",
  "Because of the way that organizations have imperatives to make money or to report to somebody or provide some analysis, we also have to keep strongly in mind how this is actually going to benefit people at the end of the day.",
  "Are the people represented in this data going to be benefited by this?.",
  "I think that's the thing you never want to lose sight of as a data scientist or a data analyst.",
  "I think aspiring data analysts need to keep in mind that a lot of the data that you're going to encounter is data that comes from people so at the end of the day, data are people.",
  "You want to have a responsibility to those people that are represented in those data.",
  "Second, is thinking about how to keep aspects of their data protected and private.",
  "We don't want to go through our practice thinking about data instances as something we can just throw on the web.",
  "No, there needs to be considerations about how to keep that information, and likenesses like their images, or their voices, or their text.",
  "How do we keep that private?.",
  "We also need to think about how we can have mechanisms of giving users and giving consumers more control over their data.",
  "It's not going to be sufficient just to say, we collect all this data and trust us with all these data.",
  "But we need to ensure that there's actionable ways in which people can consent to giving those data, and ways that they can ask for it to be revoked or removed.",
  "Data's growing and at the same time, we need to empower people to have control over their own data.",
  "The future is that data is always growing, we haven't seen any evidence that data is actually shrinking.",
  "With the knowledge that data's growing, these issues become more and more piqued, and more and more important to think about.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/lecture/GuO5O/data-analysts-in-different-industries\">With the knowledge that data's growing, these issues become more and more piqued, and more and more important to think about.</a>",
  "Data analysts in different industries.",
  "By now, we know that there are all kinds of jobs in different industries available for data analysts.",
  "But now it's time to think about something just as important, how can you tell if a job is a good fit for you and your career goals?.",
  "Tough one.",
  "Don't worry, that's exactly what we'll cover in this video.",
  "There's a lot of important factors to think about when searching for your dream job.",
  "Let's talk about some of the most common factors first, industry, tools, location, travel, and culture.",
  "Data is already being used by countless industries in all kinds of different ways, tech, marketing, finance, health care, the list goes on.",
  "But one thing that's important to keep in mind, every industry has specific data needs that have to be addressed differently by their data analysts.",
  "The same revenue data can be used in three different ways by data analysts in three different industries, financial services, Telecom, and tech.",
  "For example, a finance analyst at a bank post public revenue data of Telecom company X to create a forecast that predicts where revenues will be in the future to recommend the stock price.",
  "The business analyst at Telecom company X uses that same data to advise the sales team.",
  "Then a data analyst at the company who created a customer management tool for Telecom company X will use that revenue data to determine how efficiently the software is performing.",
  "Finance, telecom, and tech, all use data differently, so they need analysts who have different skills.",
  "It all comes down to what the needs of the industry are.",
  "Those needs will determine what task you'll be given, the questions you'll be answering and even how you'll approach job searching.",
  "If you're just starting out, a great way to guide your search is to think first about what you're interested in.",
  "Does helping people get healthier sound meaningful to you?.",
  "Maybe you want to focus on using data to improve hospital admissions.",
  "What about helping people save for a happy retirement?.",
  "You might want a job that uses data to determine risk factors in financial investments.",
  "Or maybe you're interested in helping journalism grow in your city.",
  "A job using data to help find your local news website find more subscribers could be the perfect role for you.",
  "The key is to think about your interests early in your job search.",
  "That'll lead you in the right direction, and it will help you in interviews too.",
  "Potential employers will want to know why you're interested in their company, and how you can address their needs, so if you can speak about your motivation to work in data analytics during interviews, you'll make yourself stand out in a great way.",
  "You'll have options when it comes to where you work and who you work for.",
  "But remember, you want to enjoy what you do, so it's a good idea to think about how you want to use your skills.",
  "Then search for jobs that allow you to do that.",
  "Next on the list of things to think about, location and travel.",
  "When you start your job search, you need to make some decisions about where you want to live, so it helps to ask yourself some questions, does your preferred industry have opportunities in your area?.",
  "Are you trying to stay local or would you be happy relocating?.",
  "How long are you willing to commute to work every day?.",
  "Will you drive to work, walk, take public transport?.",
  "Is that possible year-round?.",
  "How do you feel about working remotely?.",
  "Does working from home excite you or bore you?.",
  "Of course, you'll want to consider cost of living, and whether or not you want the convenience of city living or a quiet suburban home, and it's not just about where you'll be based, some jobs may ask you to travel, which could be an exciting chance to see the world or a deal-breaker.",
  "It's all about what you want out of this job, so start asking yourself some of these questions.",
  "Figuring out the answers can help you narrow down your search even further, so you're only looking at jobs you'd actually accept.",
  "Once you've answered enough questions, you'll be able to identify some specific companies that fit your needs.",
  "At this point, it's a good time to think about your values and what company culture is a good fit for you.",
  "Ready, here comes some more questions, do you work best in a team or by yourself?.",
  "Do you like to have a set routine or do you enjoy taking a new project and trying new things?.",
  "Do your values match the company's values?.",
  "You'll want to pay attention to these things during your job search and interview process, so you can be sure you fully invested in the company you work for.",
  "That's the best way to start building an exciting and fulfilling career.",
  "This program will help you learn the core skills for data analytics in any setting, it's up to you where you want to take them, whether that means starting in a completely new industry, or moving into an analyst position in an industry you already have experience in.",
  "Hopefully what we've covered here has helped you get on track for your future job search.",
  "After this, you have a few activities to do, and then you'll be able to move on to the next part of this course.",
  "We learned a lot so far, like what opportunities are out there for data analysts in different industries.",
  "How data analysts help businesses make better decisions.",
  "The importance of fairness and data analytics, and the potential questions you can start asking yourself before your future job search, and you can always look back at these lessons if you want to review.",
  "In an upcoming course, we'll look at the skills all successful data analysts have and you'll learn how you can start practicing them too.",
  "But before that, you'll have an assessment.",
  "Good luck, and I'll see you later.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/lecture/LsOFS/samah-interview-best-practices\">Good luck, and I'll see you later.</a>",
  "Samah: Interview best practices.",
  "My name is Samah Moid, and I'm a recruiter here at Google for the large customer sales team.",
  "Basically, I hire talent for the sales team here.",
  "Even within the sales recruiting space, I recruit specifically for the analytical lead roles here at Google.",
  "I want the candidate to be as comfortable as possible.",
  "As a recruiter I'm also their advocate.",
  "If they're a good fit for the team, I'd like to present them in the best light.",
  "As a recruiter some advice I would give for a data analyst that's starting to look for a job.",
  "Think about a time where you've used data to solve a problem, whether it's in your professional or personal projects.",
  "Another tip, I would say for a data analyst that's looking for a new job is to increase your professional network.",
  "There are many ways to increase your professional network.",
  "One of them is to increase your online footprint, reach out to other analysts on LinkedIn, join local meet-ups with other data scientists.",
  "Sometimes when we're looking for a unique skill set, recruiters are going on websites like LinkedIn, and GitHub, and trying to find that talent themselves.",
  "It's really important to have your LinkedIn updated along with websites like GitHub, where you can showcase a lot of the data analysts projects you've done.",
  "Another tip I would say for an in-person interview is to prepare questions for the interviewer.",
  "Make sure they're not broad questions.",
  "They should be questions that will help you understand the team and the job better.",
  "If you're given a case study in an interview, you should expect to be given a business problem along with the sample data set.",
  "Then you'd be asked to take that sample data set, analyze it, and come up with a solution.",
  "One of the things you can do to help prepare yourself for this is to ensure you are analyzing the data and coming up with a solution that relates back to that data.",
  "Sometimes there is no right answer, and a lot of times interviewers are looking to see your thought process and the way you get to your solution.",
  "I highly encourage that if you find a role that you're interested in, not only apply to it, but go the next step.",
  "Look for the recruiter.",
  "Look for the hiring manager online.",
  "See if you can reach out to them and set up a coffee chat or send them your resume directly.",
  "Online applications could be a really big black hole where you never hear back from the recruiter or the team.",
  "When you reach out directly to a hiring manager or recruiter, it really shows your eagerness for the role and your interests for the role.",
  "Even if sometimes you don't get a response from reaching out, you never know, you try multiple different times.",
  "That one time you get a response back from a recruiter or hiring manager, could be the time you get the job that you really wanted.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/lecture/fSnS4/weekly-wrap-up\">That one time you get a response back from a recruiter or hiring manager, could be the time you get the job that you really wanted.</a>",
  "Weekly wrap-up.",
  "We're at the end of this course, which means it's time to show off what you've learned.",
  "We've covered the different kinds of industries using data to drive decisions and how you can help them.",
  "How to promote fairness in your data work, and opportunities that are out there in the world of data analytics.",
  "I know you've got this.",
  "Once you finish the course challenge, I'll be right here to introduce you to the next course.",
  "<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/lecture/ROvqq/congrats-course-wrap-up\">Once you finish the course challenge, I'll be right here to introduce you to the next course.</a>",
  "Congrats Course wrap-up.",
  "Congratulations on finishing this first course.",
  "You've already learned a lot and you're ready to take what you've learned and move forward and if you ever need a refresher, just remember that these videos will still be here whenever you need them.",
  "You might remember your next instructor from our introduction at the beginning of the intro course.",
  "Get ready to meet my fellow Googler and your instructor for the next course, Ximena.",
  "She's ready to help you get started on your next step towards finishing this program and becoming a data analyst.",
  "This next course will build directly on some of the topics you've learned so far and give you insight into the things we've already talked about.",
  "Like any good detective, you learn how to ask the right questions and use data to find answers.",
  "Employees in every industry needs to become comfortable asking questions, but this can especially be true for data analysts.",
  "A lot of data analysts try to make their work perfect the first time even though they might not have all the information.",
  "Instead of asking questions, they make assumptions that can lead to mistakes.",
  "It's so much better to be humble and inquisitive and to ask questions.",
  "I'll show you what I mean.",
  "One of the analysts I supervise came into Google with no coding experience.",
  "He was nervous about leaving a great first impression, so he tried to study up on multiple languages by himself before he started.",
  "When the work actually began, he didn't ask us his team questions or ask us for help when he ran into roadblocks.",
  "There are a lot of great places to find answers, especially online, and his initiative helped them find some of those places.",
  "But at the end of the day, he forgot to tap into his best resource, us, his team, because he was nervous about how he would be perceived if he asked us for help.",
  "He almost missed out on some great insights from his team members.",
  "As roadblocks persisted, he realized he needed to make a change.",
  "He stopped trying to guess expectations, processes, and more all on his own and started asking us more questions.",
  "As soon as he embraced this new approach, he skyrocketed on our team.",
  "His learning went straight up the curve like a hockey stick.",
  "His impact on the organization, the number of people who reached out to him and his career path going for it all did the same.",
  "The bottom line is, you don't need to know it all.",
  "The saying is true, there are no bad questions.",
  "Being open to learning is one of the most important qualities for a data analyst.",
  "Speaking of learning, in the next course, we'll go into more depth learning about basic spreadsheet skills and when you need to use them, you'll discover how to apply structured thinking to data work, and your focus on how to best meet stakeholder needs and expectations by gathering all the clues.",
  "Great work, and good luck on the next course."
