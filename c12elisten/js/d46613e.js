  "Tips for enhancing your online presence.",
  "Hello.",
  "Let's talk about social media.",
  "Today, there's 3.8 billion people using social media around the world.",
  "There's a good chance you probably already have an online presence.",
  "That's great.",
  "It means you're already connecting with people online, maybe even professionally on websites like LinkedIn.",
  "If you aren't, getting started is as easy as signing up today.",
  "But there's some really easy ways you can enhance your online presence even more and use your existing profiles to build your professional identity.",
  "One of the first things you should ask yourself when looking at your new or existing online presence is this: would you be okay with potential employers and colleagues seeing your social media profiles?.",
  "Try putting yourself in their shoes.",
  "When a potential employer is looking at your public profiles, they're asking themselves if you're the right person to represent their company and values.",
  "Is there anything on your current accounts that could make them think otherwise?.",
  "If you want to limit what you share, be sure to check the privacy settings on your accounts.",
  "If they're set to public, anyone can see everything you post.",
  "You can also make specific photos or albums private, but remember this doesn't erase them from the internet.",
  "Keep in mind, changing your privacy settings doesn't necessarily keep all of your posts secure, so you should always think carefully before you post.",
  "Now the best way to make sure that your posts and photos are appropriate and professional is to delete any that you wouldn't want your future boss to see.",
  "If you're getting ready to upload photos for the first time, think about how those pictures represent you before posting them.",
  "Feel free to back up these photos for your personal files, but maybe don't put them on Facebook or Instagram.",
  "Speaking of Facebook and Instagram, there are some easy options for deleting posts on these platforms.",
  "Both Facebook and Instagram have an archive function that allows you to remove posts from your profile.",
  "You can even mass delete posts on Facebook.",
  "While you're at it, check your Twitter.",
  "Your social media profiles are probably connected, so it's important to make sure that they're all representing you the way you want to be seen professionally.",
  "A good rule of thumb: your posts should be family-friendly.",
  "This goes for photos and text posts.",
  "Check to make sure your content and language is appropriate for the whole family.",
  "While you're working on enhancing your online persona, a professional profile picture is a great touch.",
  "Even if your account is set to private, recruiters will likely still be able to see your profile picture.",
  "Having a photo for your LinkedIn profile is important because it significantly increases your chances of being contacted.",
  "Make your profile picture one that represents your professional side in the best way possible.",
  "Once you've gotten your profiles up and running, post mindfully.",
  "Think about the professional image you are trying to create and stick to it.",
  "This means curating posts for different platforms.",
  "Decide which platform you want to use for family and friends, like Facebook and Instagram, and keep updates about your personal life on those platforms.",
  "Use professional platforms, like LinkedIn, for posts related to your work life and building professional relationships.",
  "A huge number of companies and hiring managers use online sources to identify and pick candidates.",
  "So it's important to make sure that your online presence has a positive impact on your real life.",
  "Make sure your online presence is job appropriate by making your accounts private, deleting posts you wouldn't want your boss or colleagues to see, and posting mindfully.",
  "Don't be afraid to ask someone you respect professionally to take a look and give you some feedback.",

  "But in all seriousness, the work we do has everything to do with people.",
  "Once you've learned the skills and developed a strong portfolio, the next step is to connect with people in your profession or industry who can help you use those strengths to build a career.",
  "In this video, we're going to talk about networking.",
  "Networking can be called professional relationship building.",
  "It's all about meeting people both on and offline and building relationships with them.",
  "Networking will help you meet people who are similar and different from you and also stay current with what's going on in your fields.",
  "Even within the organization you're in, you want to network with other teams to better understand the projects you're working on.",
  "Here's the truth, lots of the best opportunities aren't posted on job boards.",
  "They're out there in the real world.",
  "Problems waiting to be solved, innovations just waiting for inspiration.",
  "Building your network with other data analysts could really increase your odds of breaking into the field.",
  "Actually, networking with any industry professionals can help you do that.",
  "Here's a few things you can start with, search for public meetups in your area.",
  "There's usually at least one in every major city.",
  "Just google data analytics meetups near you or search on meetup.com.",
  "Then you can learn more about different types of data analytics or share your interest with other people in the field.",
  "It's also good to remember that we live in a digital world, so don't feel confined to in-person networking.",
  "Some of the best data analysis influencers are on social media.",
  "Follow interesting companies or thought leaders on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, interact with them, and share their content.",
  "If there's a post you like, maybe leave a comment explaining why.",
  "Digital networking can take you anywhere these days.",
  "On top of that, there's also plenty of great data podcasts to follow, like Partially Derivative and the O'Reilly Data Show.",
  "Not only can they help you stay up to date with how the industry is evolving, but hearing the concepts repeated over time, can help build your confidence in your own knowledge.",
  "There's also a ton of blogs and online communities like O'Reilly, Kaggle, KDnuggets, GitHub and Medium, that can help you connect with peers and experts.",
  "The possibilities are virtually limitless when it comes to building your network.",
  "In our next video, we'll talk about one of the most effective methods, finding a mentor.",

  "Benefits of mentorship.",
  "It was Maya Angelou for Oprah Winfrey.",
  "Steven Spielberg for JJ Abrams.",
  "And Warren Buffett for Bill Gates.",
  "It's a mentor, and having one can have a huge impact on your career and your life in general.",
  "Basically, a mentor is a professional who shares their knowledge, skills, and experience to help you develop and grow.",
  "About 3 out of 4 people think that having a mentor is an important part of professional development.",
  "But studies found only 37 percent actually have a mentor.",
  "As a data analyst, you're not required to have a mentor, but those who find a good one never forget them.",
  "Mentors come in many forms.",
  "They can be trusted advisors, sounding boards, critics, resources or all of the above.",
  "Sometimes the relationship happens naturally, but usually you need to formally ask them to mentor you because they might not know you're interested in their mentorship.",
  "I've tried to seek out mentors at every stage of my career, from school to my current role at Google.",
  "It's always good to make sure your mentors have the time to support your growth and it's just as important for you to keep up a professional relationship with them.",
  "On top of a mentor, a sponsor can also help you in your career development.",
  "But we'll talk more about that a bit later.",
  "It's very important to figure out what you're looking for in a mentor.",
  "This will help narrow down your list of potential professionals.",
  "Try thinking about your strengths and challenges at work and how you'd like to grow as a data analyst.",
  "And share that openly with potential mentors!.",
  "It's also great to think about shared experiences or common ground.",
  "Maybe you're a veteran who would benefit from the guidance of a data analyst for the military.",
  "Or maybe you just think you could really benefit from talking with someone from your hometown.",
  "There's no one right way to find the perfect mentor.",
  "Your mentor doesn't even have to work with you.",
  "If there's no one you can connect with in your current work environment, you can find mentors anywhere from a social media platform, networking event or mentor matching program.",
  "For instance, websites like Score.org and MicroMentor.org and an app called Mentorship allow you to look for specific credentials that match your needs.",
  "You can then arrange dedicated times, maybe on the platform, to meet up or talk on the phone.",
  "Personally, I like reaching out with a friendly email or message on a professional networking site.",
  "If you go this route, take some time to describe your career goals and how they might align with their own experiences.",
  "Try mentioning some things you particularly like about their work or published content.",
  "From there you can easily suggest a coffee chat, virtual meetup, or email exchange to get things going.",
  "Once you've had a few exchanges, be sure to check in with yourself.",
  "Make sure it's a natural fit and you're getting everything you need.",
  "It's also a good idea to check in with your mentor to make sure it's working well for them too.",
  "Remember, this is a partnership.",
  "You and your mentor are equal participants.",
  "The more authentic and honest you are about it, the better it will go.",
  "For example, it's always a good idea to share your gratitude for their time and effort.",
  "Now, while a mentor will help you gain critical skills and navigate challenges at work, a lot of people find that having a sponsor can take their career even further.",
  "A sponsor is a professional advocate who's committed to moving a sponsee's career forward with an organization.",
  "To understand the difference between these two roles, think of it like this.",
  "A mentor helps you skill up, a sponsor helps you move up.",
  "Having the support of a sponsor is like having a safety net.",
  "They can give you the confidence to take risks at work, like asking for a new assignment or promotion.",
  "Let's talk about how you get a sponsor.",
  "Well, unlike mentors, you don't get to choose the sponsor.",
  "The sponsor almost always chooses you.",
  "The best course of action is to commit yourself to doing your best work at all times.",
  "There's a good chance someone with influence will take notice.",
  "Now that we've seen the importance of networking in relationships, it's a good idea to take some proactive steps.",
  "First, build and nurture your LinkedIn presence.",
  "Next, look at your current social media presence and make sure it's helping you put your best foot forward.",
  "Finally, always be open to connecting with peers and colleagues.",
  "You never know what great things a conversation will bring.",

  "Rachel: Mentors are key.",
  "Hi.",
  "My name is Rachel, and I'm the business systems and analytics lead at Verily.",
  "I've been lucky enough to have some really great mentors over the course of my career, and I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to have someone in your corner as you're navigating all of the different ins and outs of your career.",
  "For me, I have had some wonderful mentors who have guided me through some really tough career decisions, starting way back at the very beginning.",
  "My first mentor was a professor at school, and this professor gave me wonderful advice of how to follow my dreams and how to lean into what I was interested in.",
  "I think it's very important to also have great mentors at work.",
  "My mentor helps me navigate all the ins and outs of my organization, all the ins and outs of the politics sometimes, and also helps me make decisions on what to do next.",
  "It's nice to have a mentor who's outside of what's going on, but it's also really nice to sometimes have a mentor who understands the environment.",
  "I catch up with my mentor regularly just to touch base, just to see how we're doing, to maintain a relationship, but I specifically will schedule time with my mentor when I'm wrestling with some sort of tough question or when I have a pivotal moment coming up.",
  "For example, I've had some great conversations with my mentor about whether I really lean in on the finance side of my career or whether I want to lean in on the IT side and the system side, and helping make some of those decisions about where to focus and what to take some classes in, what to continue education on, and where to lean in with upcoming projects.",
  "Talking that through with somebody has really helped me make sense of some jumbled thoughts and figure out where to go next.",
  "I think the most important thing to look for in a mentor is somebody who you will get along with and somebody that you trust.",
  "This is a person that you are going to go to with some of potentially the toughest choices of your career, looking to them for guidance and for help and for support.",
  "My most successful mentors, the most successful mentoring relationships that I've had, have been with people who I'm close to personally or professionally and who I trust and who I feel comfortable sharing potentially deep thoughts with, and a lot of potentially sensitive details about what I'm thinking, what I'm going through, and what I want so that they can help me make sense of that and figure out what to do.",
  "I love now that I can pay that forward and share some of the wisdom that I've learned from my mentors and from some of the experiences that I've had in my career and help share that with someone else so that they can navigate some of their same decisions and some of those same situations, and hopefully learn from some of my experiences and some of my mistakes, and helping pay that forward is what's really exciting about being a mentor."
