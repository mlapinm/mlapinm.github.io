  "oh stop it.",
  "i just said that to keep eric.",
  "and marissa from making a huge mistake.",
  "huh like we did.",

  "you know why tie themselves down.",
  "now marissa can go to the college that she wants to.",
  "whether they have a football team or not.",
  "and eric can i accept a scholarship to notre dame.",
  "no matter what their married housing is like.",
  "and marissa can spend her junior year in france like she's always dreamed of.",
  "right and van.",
  "i mean eric.",
  "i can join a fraternity and do a lot of really stupid stuff.",
  "well if that's how you feel why did you marry me in the first place.",
  "well excuse me for wanting to do the right thing.",
  "maybe it wasn't the right thing.",
  "you didn't have to say yes.",
  "i'm sorry i didn't know any better.",
  "i was young.",
  "the gentle sin is this.",
  "my lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand.",
  "to smooth the rough touch with a gentle kiss.",
  "now chuck what do you think romeo was asking here.",
  "i guess he's telling me he wants to kiss her.",
  "but i don't know what pilgrims have to do with it.",
  "it's just more of a poetic way of asking.",
  "miss hart.",
  "poetry might have work back then.",
  "but today a dude needs a car.",
  "actually that's not true.",
  "try a little poetry in a nice pair of tights.",
  "and you won't believe the attention you'll get.",

  "that it was all your idea.",
  "what.",
  "you didn't counsel them to have sex.",
  "no i told them they didn't have to get married just to have sex.",
  "well that didn't sound right.",
  "see they wanted to get married.",
  "so they could be like van and cheyenne.",
  "that sounded worse.",
  "but i made it clear that teenagers.",
  "should not get married.",
  "they should have sex instead.",
  "no i would have never said.",
  "that they misunderstood me.",
  "mrs hart.",
  "it is bad enough.",
  "that you allow your.",
  "daughter to go around flaunting her big mistake.",
  "but it is not okay for you to suggest that others follow in her footsteps.",
  "they came to me asking for advice.",
  "what was i supposed to say.",
  "the policy of this school is that sex doesn't exist.",
  "how's that working for you.",
  "i'm sorry.",
  "i've made my decision.",
  "so i'm losing my job because two kids almost had sex.",
  "you're being replaced because.",
  "you put the idea in their heads.",
  "to have sex.",
  "it's in every teenager's head in america.",
  "and most of them don't even know me.",
  "teachers have to be role models.",
  "they can't go around promoting this type of behavior.",
  "i'm not promoting anything.",
  "by allowing married teenagers to live.",
  "and have sex in your house.",
  "you are.",
  "oh good reba.",
  "i'm glad you're here.",
  "you know i've been doing a lot of thinking about this job thing.",

  "i got fired.",
  "oh well.",
  "how did my life get so twisted around.",
  "one day everything's going just fine.",
  "and the next day i'm a poster mom for teen marriage and teen sex.",
  "whoa whoa whoa.",
  "what happened.",
  "i gave you some advice.",
  "and it was misunderstood.",
  "two of cheyenne's friends want to get married.",
  "because van and cheyenne make it look so fun.",

  "have i made it too easy for van and cheyenne.",
  "i mean let's face it they got.",
  "it pretty darn good.",
  "i gave them a nice wedding.",

  "well what were you supposed to do throw him out in the street.",
  "his folks did you wanted to.",
  "no i said send her away.",
  "look.",
  "every family has to make their own decision.",

  "and it's ladies day at the club.",
  "what you doing out here.",
  "mom.",
  "if you knew vanna and i weren't gonna make it.",
  "why would you let us get married in the first place.",
  "if i'd have said no would you listen to.",
  "me don't i always.",
  "well the condom speech certainly didn't take.",
  "all right.",
  "we probably would have eloped anyway.",
  "and i'd be living in a trailer somewhere barefoot and pregnant.",
  "oh honey it wouldn't have been that bad.",
  "we both know you'd have found a way to buy shoes.",
  "cheyenne we all know that the odds aren't great for you and van.",
  "but i never said you can't make it.",
  "you know.",
  "i thought if we loved each other enough.",
  "everything else would take care of itself.",
