  "p09 SPEAK ENGLISH FLUENTLY.",
  "Hey, in today's lesson I'm going to teach you how to speak English fluently using the simple rule of threes.",
  "Are you ready?.",
  "Well then I'm Teacher Tiffani.",
  "Let's jump right in.",
  "All right.",
  "So let's take a look at the rule very quickly.",
  "The rule says this: provide enough support for your thoughts, ideas, and opinions by giving three details, three examples or three reasons.",
  "Now, remember I've said before that English fluency is not about the number of words.",
  "Instead it's about your ability to support your ideas.",
  "And that's what we're going to look at today.",
  "So let's look at the first one.",
  "The first one is part one, three details.",
  "Now this part of the rule focuses on the important details of the topic, subject or person you are discussing.",
  "In other words, you want to help your listener visualize what you are talking about.",
  "Now, this is something that is so important.",
  "You see, when you're speaking to someone you want them to be able to see in their mind what you are saying.",
  "Think about story time.",
  "When I tell you a story, you can visualize it, right?.",
  "And that's something you are going to learn.",
  "How.",
  "So let's take a look at this example, we see a family walking, so the topic could be family vacation.",
  "Tell me about your last family vacation.",
  "And the simple response could be, we went to Colorado for our last family vacation.",
  "Now I'll be honest with you.",
  "That's a good response, but remember, we're trying to get an advanced level.",
  "You want to speak English fluently.",
  "So in order to do that, you must give more information, three details.",
  "So let's go back.",
  "Here's the first detail off the grid cabin, detailed to mountainous area and detail.",
  "Three breath taking land.",
  "So now with these three details, we can give a fluent English response.",
  "So here's the response we have right here.",
  "My family and I went to Colorado for our family vacation last year.",
  "At first, my mom was a little nervous because we chose to stay at an off the grid cabin.",
  "But since we stayed in a very mountainous area, my mom was satisfied with the amazing views.",
  "Honestly, we were all amazed by the breathtaking landscape when we went on.",
  "Now come on.",
  "That wasn't advanced level response.",
  "It showed fluency, right?.",
  "New fluency.",
  "And I'm going to teach you how to do that, right.",
  "Again, following the simple rule of threes, but there's something else I want to show you.",
  "You see in this response, there were a few words or expressions that were a little bit tricky.",
  "So first off the grid.",
  "Good again, after me off the grid.",
  "Excellent now real quick.",
  "Again, if you want to improve your pronunciation, download my app English with Tiffani and I have so many lessons in the app that help you with your pronunciation.",
  "So you can master English pronunciation again, download my app English with Tiffani.",
  "The link is in the description.",
  "All right, so we're taking again, a look at off the grid.",
  "This.",
  "Not using or depending on public utilities, especially the supply of electricity.",
  "So basically when you're doing something and you don't have electricity, you are basically doing something off the grid.",
  "Now this is something that I've done in the past.",
  "I was a Pathfinder.",
  "It's kind of like the boy Scouts or girl Scouts for church, and we'd go camping and there'll be no electric.",
  "We were off the grid.",
  "Makes sense.",
  "Right.",
  "All right.",
  "So off the grid.",
  "Now what about the next one?.",
  "The next one was mountainous.",
  "Good again after me mountainous.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Now this is of a region having many, many mountains.",
  "Now, when I was in South Korea, I loved hiking.",
  "I went hiking every.",
  "But my favorite mountain to hike was Sadat outside.",
  "And I remember it was beautiful whenever I go to hike.",
  "So that sun, there were mountains everywhere.",
  "You see?.",
  "So Roxanne is made up of many different peaks.",
  "It was a mountainous area.",
  "Makes sense.",
  "Right.",
  "All right.",
  "So we have mountainous again, mountainous, meaning many mountains, but what about this one right here?.",
  "Breath taking.",
  "Good.",
  "Stick your tongue through your teeth again.",
  "Breath taking excellent.",
  "Now this just means astonishing or all inspiring in quality.",
  "So as to take one's breath away.",
  "Now, remember I told you that I liked to hike when I was in Korea.",
  "I remember when I first went to the top of . I could not say a word.",
  "It was ref taking.",
  "It was so beautiful.",
  "The air, the tops of the mountains, I was at a loss for words, make sense.",
  "Something is breadth.",
  "Take it.",
  "So maybe you've also seen something that's.",
  "Taking.",
  "So again, in our response, we have all three details and that's why this response shows an advanced level response.",
  "It is an advanced level response, but what about the other part of the rule?.",
  "The rule being part two, three examples.",
  "You see, the second part of this rule focuses on examples of the topic, subject or person you artists.",
  "In other words, you want to help your listener understand more by giving them real life example situations.",
  "Now, this is something I purposely do for you all.",
  "Think about it at the end of every lesson, I give you up story time.",
  "Right?.",
  "And I connect what I'm teaching you to my life.",
  "This is a part of English fluency.",
  "Again, three examples.",
  "So let's take a look at this one right here.",
  "We see this wonderful couple of grandmother and a grandfather and the topic is grandparents.",
  "So here's the.",
  "Do you think grandchildren make grandparents happy, simple response?.",
  "Yes.",
  "I think grandparents are extremely happy when they are with their grand children.",
  "Now, this is so true.",
  "My parents have three grandchildren and my sister and I, we always laugh because my parents are totally different people.",
  "When they're with the grandchildren.",
  "So yes, grandchildren really do make well grandchildren, not only make they provide the joy that grandparents need.",
  "All right.",
  "So looking at this response right here, it's good, but we wanted the advanced level of response.",
  "So example number one, my mother was very happy to babysit my niece for two years.",
  "Example to my grandmother would smile and sneak me money whenever I went to.",
  "And example three, the highlight of my dad's day is when he gets to speak to his grandpa.",
  "So you can already see that we're giving examples situations and these situations will provide a measure of curiosity.",
  "The listener is going to want to know more, and as you explain, it will show your fluency.",
  "So let's take a little closer, look at what the response would look like, including these examples.",
  "Here we are.",
  "I'll show you that a little later.",
  "Yes.",
  "I think grandparents are extremely happy when they are with their grandchildren.",
  "That's the simple response.",
  "Now the three examples, for example, my mother was very happy to babysit my niece for two years, but it's not just my mother when I was younger.",
  "My grandmother true story would always give me a big smile and sneak me somewhere.",
  "The same is true for my dad.",
  "Honestly, the highlight of my dad's day is when he gets to speak to his grand children.",
  "So what just happened in that response?.",
  "Again, the basic response, then I gave three examples.",
  "You learned more about me and my family, and you understand why I gave the response.",
  "I did a fluent English response.",
  "Now within my response, there were some new words and express.",
  "The first one was babysit again after me babysit.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Now this word just refers to looking after a child or children while the parents are out again, taking care of the children while the parents are out.",
  "Now, my sister actually babysat some kids when we were younger.",
  "I'm younger than my sister.",
  "So when she had to babysit, I would go with her.",
  "But then when I got in high school, I also started to baby.",
  "Taking care of children in order to earn money, money.",
  "I said money, money, right?.",
  "Again, babysitting is very common in America.",
  "So looking at babysit, the next one we have is sneak someone, something.",
  "In my example story, I said, my grandmother used to sneak me some money, which she actually did, but to sneak someone something, it just means to secretly give someone something.",
  "In other words, to give someone something without other people knowing now I remember one time my grandmother, we had went to a restaurant, my mother and my grandmother and I, and I think, no, it was just the three of us.",
  "And I remember we were leaving and my grandmother said, Hey baby, Hey baby, come here, come here.",
  "She did this with her hand, come here.",
  "And she snuck me a $20 bill.",
  "I said, oh grandma, I don't need it.",
  "She said, baby, just take.",
  "And I remember that my grandmother passed away several years ago, but I always remember my grandmother sneaking me some money.",
  "I was an adult and she said, baby, but just take this $20.",
  "Maybe your grandmother does the same thing, sneaking you some money without your family members, knowing what she's doing.",
  "This is something that grandparents do.",
  "Now.",
  "What about the next one?.",
  "The highlight of someone's day after me, the highlight of someone's.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Now this just means the high point or the most exciting moment of someone's day something that makes them extremely happy.",
  "Now, yesterday, this happened, I actually was teaching a class to my students.",
  "Again, if you want to be one of my students, all you have to do is go to www dot let's, jump right in.com.",
  "The link is in the description and during the class, one of my students.",
  "Teacher, you know what, the best thing that happened to me today was I said what she said, having the opportunity to join your class.",
  "And my heart was warmed.",
  "And her comment was the highlight of my day.",
  "It made me feel so good.",
  "So during your day, you probably have things that make you feel good.",
  "You can say this thing, or this event was the highlight of my.",
  "So you see in the response we have, again, the three examples, you understand more about me, more about my parents and their love for their grandchildren.",
  "And I gave a fluent English response simply by using the rule of threes, part two, being three examples.",
  "Now what about part number three?.",
  "Part number three is focusing on giving specific reasons.",
  "For your ideas on the topic, subject or person you are discussing.",
  "In other words, you want to help your listener understand your thought process and how you developed your idea.",
  "And remember I said, English fluency is all about supporting your answers, not about giving a thousand new words.",
  "It's really about supporting your.",
  "And part of that is giving three reasons.",
  "So let's take a look at this example right here.",
  "These three look so happy to be together.",
  "So the topic could be sibling relationships.",
  "Do you get along with your siblings?.",
  "Simple response?.",
  "Yes, we get along very well.",
  "Now, remember I said, that's a good response, but your goal is to speak like a native English.",
  "You want to give an advanced level response?.",
  "So you need three reasons.",
  "So let's jump back and see the three reasons that you can give reason.",
  "Number one, our parents taught us to look out for each other reason.",
  "Number two, we have so many inside jokes and reason.",
  "Number three.",
  "Life would be meaningless without them.",
  "So now we're giving some more reasons to support our response.",
  "And this is something that's very important again, thinking about my sister.",
  "Yes.",
  "I think sibling relationships are very important.",
  "My sister, when we were growing up, she's five years older than me, and sometimes she would trick me during games so that she could have.",
  "But it's okay.",
  "I have so many good memories of my sister and I playing games together.",
  "Sibling relationships are so important now, again, looking at our three reasons, this is what our response could be.",
  "Yes.",
  "We get along very well.",
  "Growing up, our parents told us to look out for each other, so we always protected each other.",
  "We also laugh a lot because we have so many inside jokes.",
  "Honestly, my life would be meaningless without them.",
  "So what's happening.",
  "You see the fact that I gave you three reasons.",
  "It emphasizes what I'm telling you.",
  "You can say, ah, Tiffani really believes what she's saying, and that actually shows you that I'm a fluent English speaker.",
  "So giving three reasons to support their answer, shows your English fluency.",
  "So in the response, I want to look at a few of the expressions.",
  "The first one was look out for someone after me.",
  "Look out for somebody.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Good.",
  "Last time.",
  "Look out for someone.",
  "Great job.",
  "Now this just means to take care of someone and make sure that they are treated well again, to look out for someone, making sure they are treated well.",
  "And then my sister is five years older than me.",
  "But I don't have to worry about anything.",
  "Especially when I was growing up, my sister always looked out for me.",
  "She made sure that I was okay.",
  "She actually used to do my hair.",
  "She's really good at doing hair now.",
  "I didn't mind this time.",
  "And I usually do it myself now, but growing up, she looked out for me.",
  "She made sure I was okay.",
  "That's what big sisters do.",
  "All right.",
  "So looking at this one, we have looked out for someone, but what about the.",
  "Inside joke.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Last time after me inside joke.",
  "Great job now inside joke.",
  "It just means a joke that is shared exclusively by a small group of people.",
  "It means that only these individuals know what is really being set.",
  "Now, one of my friends and I, we do this all the time.",
  "We have lots of inside jokes.",
  "One joke that we have with each other is about Jurassic.",
  "And something that happened in the past with the movie.",
  "And now whenever someone says Jurassic park, we look at each other and say, Jurassic park again.",
  "It's a joke that only she, and I know it's an inside joke.",
  "So maybe you have an inside joke with your family members or your friends, but what about this one right here?.",
  "Meaningless.",
  "Good again after me meaningless.",
  "Excellent.",
  "Now this just means having no meaning or significance, it's not important.",
  "It's meaning less and many times you want to use this word when there's something that, Hey, this, honestly, I don't see anything important about it.",
  "It's meaning less.",
  "So looking at my response, you see.",
  "Three examples can be, excuse me.",
  "Three reasons can be found in my research.",
  "Again, the rule of threes.",
  "Again, we had three details, three examples, and now three reasons.",
  "And you can use this rule to finally sound like a native English speaker that remember if you want to continue studying with me, all you have to do is go to www dot let's.",
  "Jump right in.com.",
  "I want to help you achieve all of your goals.",
  "You can join thousands of students from around the world.",
  "I hope you enjoy today's lesson.",
  "Thanks so much for joining, but as always remember to speak English, you still there, you know what time it is?.",
  "It's story time.",
  "I said it's story time.",
  "All right.",
  "So today's story.",
  "It's about my siblings.",
  "So I have two older sisters.",
  "All right.",
  "Now I'm the youngest, right?.",
  "And my middle sister, she's five years older than me and the next sister is nine years older than me.",
  "So growing up, I remember one time.",
  "So we were in my room.",
  "This was when I lived in Arizona and I may have been four years old.",
  "So my sister above me.",
  "Uh, nine years old.",
  "And then my other sister was above her was 13 years old and we're all just sitting in my room playing.",
  "And I remember there was a game we liked to play and we called it Superman.",
  "Right.",
  "Superman, you know, the, the superhero, right?.",
  "So what we do is one person would lay on the ground and they'd stick their legs straight up in the air.",
  "And the other person would lie flat.",
  "On the person's feet.",
  "So the feet would be like this and you'd lay your body on their feet.",
  "And then the person would pump their legs.",
  "1, 2, 3, and shoot you out into the air.",
  "And you fly like Superman.",
  "Now think about it.",
  "Who was the person on top of that?.",
  "You know, it was me.",
  "I was the smallest.",
  "So I remember this time, my sister, she laid on the ground.",
  "She said, come on, TIFF.",
  "Let's do it.",
  "Let's do it.",
  "G I said, okay.",
  "Okay, Simona, let's do it.",
  "She got on the ground, put her features in.",
  "All right, tip.",
  "Get on my feet again.",
  "I was about four years old, so I got on her feet.",
  "She said, spread your arms out.",
  "TIF.",
  "You're about to fly.",
  "So I spread my arms out.",
  "I was.",
  "I was all my big sister's feet.",
  "And I said, go, she said 1, 2, 3.",
  "And I flew through the air and boom, I hit the wall now.",
  "Clearly I was okay.",
  "But the problem was there was a big hole in the wall.",
  "I hit the wall.",
  "Everything got quiet.",
  "My sisters looked at each other, then they looked at me and I looked at them.",
  "They're like, are you okay?.",
  "I said, yeah, I'm okay.",
  "And then we all looked at each other again and said, but we got.",
  "You see, we knew that my mom was going to get us now.",
  "I don't remember what happened to us.",
  "And usually when a traumatic experience happens, you try to block it out of your memory.",
  "So I'm sure we all got spankings and we got in big trouble because there was a hole in the.",
  "But I'll tell you this.",
  "I am almost 40 years old.",
  "And to this day, I still remember flying through the air.",
  "So sometimes getting in trouble.",
  "Yes, it's bad.",
  "But when you're making good memories with your siblings, it's all worth it.",
  "All right.",
  "I hope you enjoy today's story.",
  "I hope you also have some experiences with your siblings.",
  "Remember, if you want to keep studying with me, go to www dot let's.",
  "Jump right in.com.",
  "I love you.",
  "And I'll talk to you next time."
