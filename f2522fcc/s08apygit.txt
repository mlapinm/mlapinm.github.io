100 WEEK 1 Introduction to Version Control 
In this module, you'll be introduced to the concept of version control, which will make managing and rolling back your code look super easy. You’ll learn how to differentiate between files and the tools at your disposal to make this happen. Next, you'll be introduced to Git and how you can leverage that platform to improve your coding abilities. Once you’ve got a grasp on what Git is, you’ll install it and start using it to create and clone code repositories. Last up, you’ll deep dive into Git in order to get more familiar with the different tools and commands it has to offer.

108 What is version control?3m
Version Control System (VCS)
Keeps track of the changes we make to our files

We can make edits to multiple files and treat that collection of edits as a single change, which is commonly known as a commit.

200 WEEK2 Using Git Locally In this module, you’ll dive into advanced Git interactions by skipping the staging area for small code changes, and understand how Git uses the HEAD alias to represent checked-out snapshots. Next, you’ll explore how to move and remove files before finally getting a cheat sheet to help you in your Git explorations! The next step of your learning will include how to undo changes before committing and how to amend commits once they’re submitted. Finally, you’ll be able to identify errors in commits that were submitted a while back. In the final section of this module, you’ll explore the concept of branching and merging. You’ll learn what a branch is, how to create one, and how they work in harmony with you and your code. Once you’re comfortable with branching, you’ll dive into merging, how it works with branched data, and how to deal with merge conflicts.

202 Intro to Module 2: Using Git Locally1m

203 Skipping the Staging Area4m
git commit -a
A shortcut to stage any changes to tracked files and commit them in one step

#!/usr/bin/env python3 

import os

def check reboot():
  """Returns True if the computer has a pending reboot."""
  return os.path.exist("/run/reboot-required")

def main():
  pass
  
main()

git diff
-p
atom all_checks.py
git commit -a -m "Call check reboot from main, exit with 1 on error"
git log

Git uses the HEAD alias to represent the currently checked-out snapshot of your project.

204 Getting More Information About Our Changes6m
patch
git log -p
diff -u
git show
--stat
git diff

#!/usr/bin/env python3 import os 

import sys

def check_reboot():
  """Returns True if the computer has a pending reboot."""	
  return os.path.exist("/run/reboot-required")

def main():
  if checkreboot():
    print("Pending Reboot.") 
	sys.exit(1)
  print("Everything ok.")
  sys.exit(0)
	
main()

git add -p

git diff --staged

git commit -m 'Add a message when everything is ok'

205 Deleting and Renaming Files4m
git rm
ls -l
git rm process.py
ls -l

207 Amending Commits4m
--amend
touch auto-update.py 
touch gather-information.sh 
ls -l
git add gather-information.sh
git commit --amend

What does the git commit --amend do?
O Add an error log to the commit.
O Remove files from the staging area. 
O Change the commit message.
(•) Overwrite the previous commit.

Avoid amending commits that have already been made public.


208 Rollbacks5m
git revert
HEAD

def check_reboot():
  """Returns True if the computer has a pending reboot."""	
  return os.path.exists("/run/reboot-required")

def main():
  if check reboot():
    print("Pending Reboot.") 
	sys.exit (1)
    print("Everything ok.") 
	sys.exit(0)
	
main()

atom all_checks.py
git commit -a -m 'Add call to disk_full function'

git revert HEAD

git log -p -2

Question
Which of the following is true about the git revert command?
O It undoes a commit as though it never happened.
(.)It creates a new commit with inverse changes.
O The output of git revert is not the same as a regular commit. 
O It does not include the ID of the commit that was reverted.

Awesome! With sit revert, a new commit is created with inverse changes. This cancels previous changes instead of making it as though the original commit never happened.

209 Identifying a Commit6m
git log -1
Hash
SHA1
"You can verify the data you get back out is the exact same data you put in."
Linus Torvalds

git log -2
git show
git show 30e70712882267ca2dd749acfa02ea3aacfd0b24|
git show 30e70
git revert 30e70

Which of the following is NOT true about the SHA1 hash numbers that Git uses to identify commits?
O They provide the consistency that is critical for distributed systems such as Git.
O They are created using the commit message, date, author, and the snapshot taken of the working tree.
(.) Git requires the entire hash ID to identify a commit.
O They are composed of 40 characters.

You nailed it! Git can identify a commit using the first few hash numbers as long as there is only one matching possibility.

210 What is a branch?3m
Branch
A pointer to a particular commit
The default branch that git creates for you when a new repository is initialized is called master.

211 Creating New Branches4m
We can use the git branch command to list, create, delete, and manipulate branches.
git branch
git branch new-feature 
git branch
git checkout

We use git checkout to check out the latest snapshot for both files and for branches.

We use git checkout to check out the latest snapshot for both files and for branches.

git checkout new-feature 
git branch
git checkout -b new branch
git checkout -b even-better-feature

git add free_memory.py
git commit -m 'Add an empty free_memory.py'
git log -2

#!/usr/bin/env python3

def main(): 
  pass

main ()

212 Working with Branches3m
$ cd checks
$ git status
$ Is -l
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 658 Jan 6 09:15 c usage.py -rw-r--r-- 1 user user 57 Jan 6 09:46 free_memory.py

git branch -d
$ git	branch
even-better-feature
* master 
new-feature

$ git branch -d new-feature
Deleted branch new-feature (was 7dldel9).
$ git branch
even-better-feature
* master

$ git branch -d even-better-feature
error: The branch 'even-better-feature' is not fully merged.
If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D even-better-feature'

213 Merging2m
Merging
The term that Git uses for combining branched data and history together

git merge

git branch
git merge even-better-feature

Git uses two different algorithms to perform a merge: fast-forward and three-way merge.

214 Merge Conflicts6m
atom free_memory.py
free_memory.py git commit -a -m 'Print everything ok'

def main():
  """Checks if there's enough free memory in the computer."""
  
main()

def main():
  print("Everything is ok.")
  
main()

$ git commit -a -m 'Print everything ok'
$ git checkout master
$ git merge even-better-feature

Auto-merging free_memory.py

CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in free_memory.py Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

def main():
<<<<<< HEAD

    """Checks if there's enough free memory in the computer"""
======
    print("Everything is ok.") »»»> even-better-feature
>>>>>> even-better-featur	
	
main()

def main():
use me =
    """Checks if there's enough free memory in the computer."""
    print("Everything is ok.")

main()

atom free_memory.py 
git add free_memory.py 
git status

git log --graph --oneline

It prevents loss of work if two lines overlap.

O It helps us understand which changes to keep. O It warns us of all potential problems.

O It tells us whether the commit is a merge
Correct

Nice job! If two lines have differences Git is unsure about, it's best we decide than risk losing work forever.

git merge --abort

300 WEEK3 Working with Remotes In this module, you’ll be introduced to GitHub and learn how it works with Git. You’ll create new repositories and clone those repositories onto your computer. Next, we’ll explain what a remote repository is, how we can work with them, and how we can host them. You’ll get familiar with commands like modify, stage, and commit, which will be used for local changes, as well as the fetch command, which can pull any changes from remote repositories. Our final lesson will focus on learning about conflicts. This will allow you to explore the concepts of pull-merge-push workflows, pushing remote branches and rebasing your changes.

409 Managing Collaboration4m
If you're a project maintained it's important that you reply promptly to pull requests and don't let them stagnate.

It's important that you understand any changes you accept.

When it comes to coordinating who does what and when, a common strategy for active software projects is to use an issue tracker.
