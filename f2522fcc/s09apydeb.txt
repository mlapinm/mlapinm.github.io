-1.	Getting information
-2.	Finding the root cause
-3.	Performing the necessary remediation

Workaround
Document what we do

What is the second step of problem solving?
O Short-term remediation 
O Long-term remediation (.) Finding the root cause 
O Gathering information
Correct

Right on! Finding the root cause is the second step taken when problem solving.

106 Silently Crashing Application5m
strace

strace ./purplebox.py

System calls
Calls that the programs running on our computer make to the running kernel

strace -o

strace -o failure.strace ./purplebox.py

O strace -o fail.strace (.) ./script.py strace ./script.py | less 
O strace ./script.py 
O strace ./script.py -o fail.strace
Correct

Great work! Piping the less command allows you to scroll through a lot of text output.

107 "It Doesn't Work"7m
What were you trying to do? What steps did you follow? What was the expected result?
What was the actual result?

What were they trying to do?
What steps did they follow?
What was the expected result?
What did they get instead?

When a user reports that a "website doesn't work," what is an appropriate follow-up question you can use to gather more information about the problem?

(.) What steps did you perform?
O Is the server receiving power?
O What server is the website hosted on?
O Do you have support ticket number?
You got it! Asking the user what steps they performed will help you gather more information in

108 Creating a Reproduction Case4m
kill-stop
Reproduction case
A way to verify if the problem is present or not

Linux
/var/log/syslog
.xsession-errors

MacOs
/Libra ry/Logs

Windows
Event Viewer

Unable to reach server

Invalid file format
Permission denied

Internal system error
strace
ltrace

A program fails with an error, "No such file or directory." You create a directory at the expected file path and the program successfully runs. Describe the reproduction case you'll submit to the program developer to verify and fix this error.

(.) A report explaining to open the program without the specific directory on the computer 
O A report with application logs exported from Windows Event Viewer O A report listing the contents of the new directory 
O A report listing the differences between strace and Itrace logs.
Correct

You got it! This a specific way to reproduce the error and verify it exists. The developer can work on fixing it right away.

109 Finding the Root Cause6m

Understanding the root cause is essential for performing the long-term remediation.

Whenever possible, we should check our hypothesis in a test environment, instead of the production environment that our users are working with.

Generally, understanding the root cause is essential for

O Purchasing new devices 
O Producing test data 
O Avoiding interfering with users 
(.) Providing the long-term resolution

Observer effect
Observing a phenomenon alters the phenomenon

What sort of software bug might we be dealing with if power cycling resolves a problem?

(.) Poorly managed resources 
O A heisenbug 
O Logs filling up 
O A file remains open
Correct

Way to go! Power cycling releases resources stored in cache or memory, which gets rid of the problem.

111 Intermittently Failing Script9m

/bin/bash
meeting info=$(zenity   
  --forms \
  --title 'Meeting' --text 'Reminder information' \ 
  --add-calendar 'Date' --add-entry 'Title' \

Question 5
The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times, and contains many types, objects, and methods. You've seen some of them used in the dow function, which returns the day of the week for a specific date. We'll use them again in the next_date function, which takes the date_string parameter in the format of "year-month-day", and uses the add_year function to calculate the next year that this date will occur (it's 4 years later for the 29th of February during Leap Year, and 1 year later for all other dates). Then it returns the value in the same format as it receives the date: "year-month-day".   
Can you find the error in the code? Is it in the next_date function or the add_year function? How can you determine if the add_year function returns what it's supposed to? Add debug lines as necessary to find the problems, then fix the code to work as indicated above. 
import datetime
from datetime import date
def add_year(date_obj):
  try:
    new_date_obj = date_obj.replace(year = date_obj.year + 1)
  except ValueError:
    # This gets executed when the above method fails, 
    # which means that we're making a Leap Year calculation
    new_date_obj = date_obj.replace(year = date_obj.year + 4)
  return new_date_obj
def next_date(date_string):
  # Convert the argument from string to date object
  date_obj = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_string, r"%Y-%m-%d")
  next_date_obj = add_year(date_obj)
  # Convert the datetime object to string, 
  # in the format of "yyyy-mm-dd"
  next_date_string = next_date_obj.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
  return next_date_string
today = date.today()  # Get today's date
print(next_date(str(today))) 
# Should return a year from today, unless today is Leap Day
print(next_date("2021-01-01")) # Should return 2022-01-01
print(next_date("2020-02-29")) # Should return 2024-02-29

Question 1
You have a list of computers that a script connects to in order to gather SNMP traffic and calculate an average for a set of metrics. The script is now failing, and you do not know which remote computer is the problem. How would you troubleshoot this issue using the bisecting methodology?
v Run the script with the first half of the computers.
Run the script with last computer on the list.
Run the script with first computer on the list
Run the script with two-thirds of the computers.
Question 2
The find_item function uses binary search to recursively locate an item in the list, returning True if found, False otherwise. Something is missing from this function. Can you spot what it is and fix it? Add debug lines where appropriate, to help narrow down the problem.
#!/usr/bin/env python
def find_item(list, item):
  list.sort()
  #Returns True if the item is in the list, False if not.
  if len(list) == 0:
    return False
  #Is the item in the center of the list?
  middle = len(list)//2
  if list[middle] == item:
    return True
  #Is the item in the first half of the list? 
  if item < list[middle]:
    #Call the function with the first half of the list
    return find_item(list[:middle], item)
  else:
    #Call the function with the second half of the list
    return find_item(list[middle+1:], item)
  return False
#Do not edit below this line - This code helps check your work!
list_of_names = ["Parker", "Drew", "Cameron", "Logan", "Alex", "Chris", "Terry", "Jamie", "Jordan", "Taylor"]
print(find_item(list_of_names, "Alex")) # True
print(find_item(list_of_names, "Andrew")) # False
print(find_item(list_of_names, "Drew")) # True
print(find_item(list_of_names, "Jared")) # False
Reset
Question 3
The binary_search function returns the position of key in the list if found, or -1 if not found. We want to make sure that it's working correctly, so we need to place debugging lines to let us know each time that the list is cut in half, whether we're on the left or the right. Nothing needs to be printed when the key has been located.   
For example, binary_search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 3) first determines that the key, 3, is in the left half of the list, and prints "Checking the left side", then determines that it's in the right half of the new list and prints "Checking the right side", before returning the value of 2, which is the position of the key in the list.  
Add commands to the code, to print out "Checking the left side" or "Checking the right side", in the appropriate places.  
#!/usr/bin/env python
def binary_search(list, key):
    #Returns the position of key in the list if found, -1 otherwise.
    #List must be sorted:
    list.sort()
    left = 0
    right = len(list) - 1
    while left <= right:
        middle = (left + right) // 2
        if list[middle] == key:
            return middle
        if list[middle] > key:
            right = middle - 1
            print("Checking the left side")            
        if list[middle] < key:
            left = middle + 1
            print("Checking the right side")
    return -1 
print(binary_search([10, 2, 9, 6, 7, 1, 5, 3, 4, 8], 1))
"""Should print 2 debug lines and the return value:
Checking the left side
Checking the left side 0
"""
print(binary_search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 5))
"""Should print no debug lines, as it's located immediately: 4
"""
print(binary_search([10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 7))
"""Should print 3 debug lines and the return value:
Checking the right side

Question 4
When trying to find an error in a log file or output to the screen, what command can we use to review, say, the first 10 lines?
wc
tail
v head
bisect
Question 5
The best_search function compares linear_search and binary_search functions, to locate a key in the list, and returns how many steps each method took, and which one is the best for that situation. The list does not need to be sorted, as the binary_search function sorts it before proceeding (and uses one step to do so). Here, linear_search and binary_search functions both return the number of steps that it took to either locate the key, or determine that it's not in the list. If the number of steps is the same for both methods (including the extra step for sorting in binary_search), then the result is a tie. Fill in the blanks to make this work. 
#!/usr/bin/env python
# best_search
def linear_search(list, key):
    #Returns the number of steps to determine if key is in the list 
    #Initialize the counter of steps

    steps_binary = binary_search(list, key)
    results = "Linear: " + str(steps_linear) + " steps, "
    results += "Binary: " + str(steps_binary) + " steps. "
    if (steps_linear < steps_binary):
        results += "Best Search is Linear."
    elif (steps_linear > steps_binary):

200 WEEK 2 Slowness 
In this module, you'l learn about what factors can cause a machine or program to act slowly. You'l dive into ways of addressing slowness by identifying the bottleneck that might be causing the slowness. You'l learn about tools to identify which resources are being exhausted, including iotop, iftop, and activity monitor in MacOS. Next, you'l learn how computers use resources, and understand the differences between CPU, RAM, and Cache in order to help you find the possible causes for slowness in our machines or scripts.
Next up, you'l learn how to write efficient code, then explore profilers to help you identify where your code is spending most of its time. Next, you'l dive into data structures and understand which ones are right for you to use. These include lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and expensive loops. Then, you'l dive into complex slowness problems and how utilizing concurrency and adding a caching service can improve the execution of your code. Finally, you'l understand how using threads can make the execution of your code much quicker.

204 Why is my computer slow?4m
Identify the bottleneck
Exhausted
top
iotop
iftop
MacOS
Activity Monitor
Windows

When addressing slowness, what do you need to identify?
(.)The bottleneck 
O The device 
O The script 
O The system
Woohoo! The bottleneck could be the CPU time, or time spent reading data from disk.

205 How Computers Use Resources5m
Cache
Stores data in a form that's faster to than its original form

Cached

Memory leak
Memory which is no longer needed is not getting released

After retrieving data from the network, how can an application access that same data quicker next time?
O Use the swap 
(.) Create a cache 
O Use memory leak 
O Store in RAM
You nailed it! A cache stores data in a form that's faster to access than its original form.

206 Possible Causes of Slowness5m
Logrotate

A computer becomes sluggish after a few days, and the problem goes away after a reboot. Which of the following is the possible cause?

O Files are growing too large.
(.) A program is keeping some state while running.
O Files are being read from the network.
O Hard drive failure.
Awesome! A program keeping a state without any change can slow down a computer up until it rebooted.

208 Writing Efficient Code4m
We should always start by writing clear code that does what it should, and only try to make it faster if we realize that it's not fast enough.

Trying to optimize every second out of a script is probably not worth your time.

If we want our code to finish faster, we need to make our computer do less work.

Profiler
A tool that measures the resources that our code is using, giving us a better understanding of what's going on

gprof
cProfile

kcachegrind

Expensive actions
Those that can take a long time to complete

What is the cProfile module used for?
O For parsing files.
O To analyze a C program.
(.)  To count functions calls 
O To remove unnecessary functions.
Right on! The cProfile module is used to count how many times functions are called, and how long they run.

209 Using the Right Data Structures3m
Lists
Tuples
Dictionaries
Sets

Lists
Sequences of elements. We can add, remove, or modify the elements in them, and we can iterate through the whole list to operate on each of the elements.

ArrayList in Java 
Vector in C++ 
Array in Ruby
Slice in Go

Dictionaries
Store key-value pairs. We add data by associating a value to a key, and then we retrieve a value by looking up a specific key.

HashMap in Java 
Unordered Map in C+ 
Hash in Ruby 
Map in Go

If you need to access elements by position, or will always iterate through all the elements, use a list to store them.

If we need to look up the elements using a key, we'll use a dictionary.

Which of the following has values associated with keys in Python? 
A hash
(•) A dictionary 
A HashMap 
An Unordered Map
You nailed it! Python uses a dictionary to store values, each with a specific key.

210 Expensive Loops4m
If you do an expensive operation inside a loop, you multiply the time it takes to do the expensive operation by the amount of times you repeat the loop.

Make sure that the list of elements that you're iterating through is only as long as you really need it to be.

Another thing to remember about loops is to break out of the loop once you've found what you were looking for.

break

Your Python script searches a directory, and runs other tasks in a single loop function for 100s of computers on the network. Which action will make the script the least expensive?
(.) Read the directory once 
O Loop the total number of computers 
O Service only half of the computers 
O Use more memory
Awesome! Reading the directory once before the loop will make the script less expensive to run.

211 Keeping Local Results4m
Your script calculates the average number of active user sessions during business hours in a seven-day period. How often should a local cache be created to give a good enough average without updating too often?
O Once a week 
(.) Once a day 
O Once a month 
O Once every 8 hours
Woohoo! A local cache for every day can be accessed quickly, and processed for a seven-day

212 Slow Script with Expensive Loop7m
You use the time command to determine how long a script runs to complete its various tasks. Which output value will show the time spent doing operations in the user space?
O Real
O Wall-clock
O Sys
(.) User
You nailed it! The user value is the time spent doing operations in the user space.

Slow Script with Expensive Loop
time
tine ./send_reminders.py "2020-01-13|Example|test1"

Real
The amount of actual time that it took to execute the command

O Real
O Wall-clock
O SVS
(•) User
You nailed it! The user value is the time spent doing operations in the user space.

213 Parallelizing Operations6m
Concurrency

Threads
Let us run parallel tasks inside a process

Threading
Asyncio
I/O bound
CPU bound

A script is ________ if you are running operations in parallel using all available CPU time.
O I/O bound
O Threading 
(•) CPU bound 
O Asyncio
Right on! A script is CPU bound if you're running operations in parallel using all available CPU time.

214 Slowly Growing in Complexity4m
You're creating a simple script that runs a query on a list of product names of a very small business, and initiates automated tasks based on those queries. Which of the following would you use to store product names?
O SQLite
O Microsoft SQL Server 
O Memcached

300 WEEK 3 Crashing Programs 
In this module, you'l get introduced to the age old question, why has my program crashed?・You'l learn how to troubleshoot system crashes and application crashes, what tools you can be used to help identify the cause of the crash, and what log files to look at in order to find what might have gone wrong. Next, you'l dive into investigating why code crashes, and what you can do to prevent that from happening. Then, you'l explore what happens when an unhandled error occurs and throws an exception. You'l learn about the printf debugging technique, which will help you identify these errors and exceptions. Finally, you'l explore the concept of handling crashes and incidents at a much larger scale.
You'l delve into a scenario where a large eCommerce site will throw an error 20% of the time. Once that issue has been fixed, you'l understand the importance of communication and documentation during these incidents, and how writing a post mortem can prevent issues from happening again.

305 Understanding Crashing Applications6m
Console app
Permission denied
No such file or directory
Connection refused
Debug logging

Linux
strace

MacOS
dtruss

Windows
Process Monitor

To find the root cause of a crashing application, we'll want to look at all available logs, figure out what changed, trace the system or library calls the program makes, and create the smallest possible reproduction case.

Where should you look for application logs on a Windows system?
O The /var/log directory

  image.thumbnail(size)
  # Store the thumbnail in the thumbnails folder 
  new_name = f1thumbnails/{basename}'
  image.save(new_name, "JPEG ) 
  return new name

After getting acquainted with the program's code, where might you start to fix a problem?
O Run through tests 
O Read the comments
(.) Locate the affected function 
O Create new tests
Nicely done! Start working on the function that produced the error, and the function(s) that called it.

315 Writing Effective Postmortems4m
Postmortems
Documents that describe details of incidents to help us learn from our mistakes

What caused the issue
What the impact of the issue was
How it got diagnosed
The short-term remediation you applied
The long-term remediation you recommend

Postmortem: External network down
Date: 2020-01-06
Executive Summary
Impact: The network connection was down and nobody could access the internet for 2 hours. 
Root Cause: A misconfiguration in our main router caused all traffic to be sent to a void. 
Action Items: The bad configuration was rolled back. Improved testing to avoid this in the future is being developed.
Root Causes and Trigger
With change #275643, we intended to deploy traffic shaping to our router. However, there was a typo in the rules that caused the router to error out with syntax error and deny all traffic instead.
The change was created in advanced and put into the release pipeline. This meant that there was a significant delay between the commit and the outage, causing some confusion as to why it had happened.
Lessons Learned
Things that went well:
Our monitoring detected the problem really quickly
Once we understood the problem, we were able to roll back to the previously known

When writing an effective postmortem of an incident, what should you NOT include?
O What caused the issue 
(.) Who caused the issue 
O What the impact was 
O The short-term remediation
Nailed it! A postmortem of an incident should not include the person(s) who caused the issue.

400 WEEK 4 Managing Resources 
In this module, you'l learn how to manage your applications. You'l dive into some common issues that may cause your application to crash. You'l also understand what memory leaks are, and how to troubleshoot and prevent them. Up next, you'l run down managing disk space; you'l see some scenarios of how this happens and how to identify what process or application is taking up all your disk space. Then, you'll learn what network saturation is, how it can be caused, and some useful tools and techniques to solve a network saturation problem.
Next, we'l shift from managing applications to managing your time. You'l get tips on how to prioritize tasks, estimate how long a particular task will take before finishing, and communicate expectations when dealing with important tasks. The final lesson delves into how to deal with hard and complex problems by breaking it down into small, digestible chunks while keeping your eyes on a clear goal. You'l learn that using proactive approaches, like continuous integration, can help you with future issues that might come up. You'l also explore how to plan for future resource usage by making good use of monitoring.

O Automated server scripts.
Right on! Spare drives are a practical shortcut that can quickly replace hard drives in a pre-fail state.

412 Dealing with Hard Problems4m
“Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?”
Develop code in small, digestible chunks
Keep your goal clear
When facing a problem with a service, which of the following examples can remediate the issue quickly for the short-term?
O Create tests for the program before coding.
O Develop codes in small chunks.
(.) Ask someone who has solved the issue before for help.
O Grab a cup of coffee.

413 Proactive Practices5m
If we're the ones writing the code, one thing we can do is to make sure that our code has good unit tests and integration tests.
Continuous integration
Test environment
Deploy software in phases or canaries
Debug logging

Centralized logs collection
A special server that gathers all the logs from all the servers, or even all the computers in the network
Monitoring system
Ticketing systems
If we ask users to provide the needed information up front, we don’t have to waste time and go back and forth.
Playbooks

414 Planning Future Resource Usage4m
NAS Network-Attached Storage
You have a small rack of servers and other components that make up a virtual infrastructure. This rack hosts virtual machines that provide web services, and user file shares to employees in the local office, and immediate regional branches. Which component in the rack can be most easily planned for future growth?

o CPU Capacity 
o RAM Capacity 
(.) NAS capacity 
o Network bandwidth
Nice job! Network Attached Storage (NAS) products from vendors like NetApp can provide additional shelves to add more storage as the website's content, and users' data increases in size.

If you have to work around an issue in an application developed by someone else, it’ important that you report a bug to the relevant developers.

If you have to work around an issue in the software that you own, make sure that you write a test that catches the problem.

Which of the following is the most effective way to prevent an issue in a program that you own from happening again?
o Report a bug 
(.) Write a test
o Monitor resources 
o Reproduction case
Great work! When updating code to fix an issue, create a new test to ensure the change performs the intended actions.
