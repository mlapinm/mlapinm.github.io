101 What is System Administration?
Welcome to the System Administration course of the IT Support Professional Certificate! In the first week of this course, we will cover the basics of system administration. We'll cover organizational policies, IT infrastructure services, user and hardware provisioning, routine maintenance, troubleshooting, and managing potential issues. By the end of this module, you will understand the roles and responsibilities of a System Administrator. So let's get started!
102 Course Introduction4мин
System administration
The field in IT that’s responsible for maintaining reliable computer systems in a multi-user environment

103 What is Systems Administration?2мин

IT infrastructure encompasses the software, the hardware, network, an services required for an organization to operate in an enterprise IT environment.
Sysadmins
Database administrators

104 Servers Revisited4мин
A sysadmin is responsible for their company's IT services.
Email
File storage
Running a website

Servers
Server
Software or a machine that provides services to other software or machines
Email server
SSH server
Clients
KVM Switch

105 The Cloud3мин

Data Center
A facility that stores hundreds, if not thousands, of servers
Cost
Dependency

106 Organizational Policies2мин
Should users be allowed to install software?
Should users have complex passwords with certain requirements?
Symbols
Random numbers

With great power comes great responsibility.
Reverting to the previous state is called a rollback.

115 Never Test in Production2мин
Production
The parts of the infrastructure where a certain service is executed and served to its users

Test environment
A virtual machine running the same configuration as the production environment, but isn’t actually serving any users of the service

Secondary or stand-by machine
This machine will be exactly the same as a production machine, but won't receive any traffic from actual users until you enable it to do so 

For even bigger services, when you have lots of servers providing the service, you may want to have canaries.

116 Assessing Risk2мин
In general, the more users your service reaches, the more you'll want to ensure that changes aren't disruptive.

The more important your service is to your company’s operations, the more you’ll work to keep the service up.

117 Fixing Things the Right Way2мин
Reproduction case
Creating a roadmap to retrace the steps that led the user to an unexpected outcome

What steps did you take to get to this point? 
What’s the unexpected or bad result?
What’s the expected result?

Remember: always do this in your test instance, never in production.

After applying your fix, retrace the same steps that took you to the bad experience. If your fix worked, the expected experience should now take place.

Zone
If one of them fails for some reason, the others are still available and services can migrated without visibly affecting users.
Public Private Hybrid

Cloud services provided to you by a third party
Private Cloud

501 Ќ≈ƒ≈Ћя 5 Data Recovery & Backups
In the fifth week of this course, we'll learn about data recovery and backups. In any tech role, it's important to know how to backup and recover data -- it's even more important for system administration. We will also learn about common corporate practices like designing a disaster recovery plan and writing post-mortem documentation. By the end of this module, you'll know the tradeoffs between on-site and off-site backups, understand the value and importance of backup and recovery testing, know different options for data backup (as well as the risks) and understand the purpose and contents of a disaster recovery plan.
502 What is Data Recovery?3мин
Data recovery
The process of trying to restore data after an unexpected event that results in data loss or corruption

When an unexpected event occurs, your main objective is to resume normal operations as soon as possible, while minimizing the disruption to business functions.

The best way to be prepared for a data-loss event is to have a well-thought-out disaster plan and procedure in place.

Disaster plans should involve making regular backups of any and all critical data that’s necessary for your ongoing business processes.

Post-mortem

A post-mortem is a way for you to document any problems you discovered along the way, and most importantly, the ways you fixed them so you can make sure they don't happen again.

601 Ќ≈ƒ≈Ћя 6 Final Project
Congratulations, you've made it to the final week in the course! The last week of this course is dedicated to the final project. For the final project, you will apply all the skills you've learned in this course by providing systems administration consultation. You will assess the IT infrastructure of three fictitious (but very real-life based!) companies and provide recommendations and advice about how to support their IT infrastructure. By the end of this project, you will demonstrate the skills and problem-solving techniques of a SysAdmin. Good luck!
