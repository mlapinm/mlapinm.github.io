The bare minimum HTML document HTML version declaration Our first HTML tags!
<html> — <meta> — <head> — <title> — <body>
Sequential (top to bottom) rendering

112 Lecture 5: HTML Content Models6m
Block-Level Elements
Render to begin on a new line (by default)
May contain inline or other block-level elements

Inline Elements
Render on the same line (by default)
May only contain other inline elements
HTML5 replaces these definitions with more complex set of content categories.

HTML5 replaces these definitions with more complex set of content categories.
However, this distinction remains practical because it aligns well with existing CSS rules.

Summary
Compared block-level & inline content types
Officially not part of HTML5, but still used
Roughly equivalent to flow content & phrasing content

113 Lecture 6: Heading Elements (and some new HTML5 semantic comments)7m

200 WEEK2 Introduction to CSS3
A lot of people "tinker" with CSS. In this module, we'll take you from the very basics of CSS3 to some fairly advanced concepts like floating and CSS rule conflict resolution. We'll go over the 'box model', background property, etc. We'll finish off the module with learning about Responsive Design using our own CSS code as well as start introducing Twitter Bootstrap with its essential Grid System.
201 Welcome to Module 2: Introduction to CSS350s
202 Lecture 11: Power of CSS5m
Summary
CSS is an incredibly powerful technology User experience of content matters

203 Lecture 12: Anatomy of a CSS Rule4m
Summary
Syntax of a CSS rule
Selector
Declaration
Property/value pair Style sheet


204 Lecture 13: Element, Class, and ID Selectors9m

205 Lecture 14: Combining Selectors9m
article > p { color: blue
}

Descendant Selector
article p { color: blue;
}
Every p that is inside (at any level) of article

Not Limited To Element Selectors
.colored p { color: blue;
}
article > .colored { color: blue;
}

Summary
Combining selectors
Element with class selector (selector. class)
Child (direct) selector (selector > selector)
Descendent selector (selector selector)
Didn’t cover
Adjacent sibling selector (selector + selector)
General sibling selector (selector - selector)

206 Lecture 15: Pseudo-Class Selectors9m
Pseudo-Class Selector
Many pseudo-class selectors exist We cover:
:link
:hover 
:active 
:nth-child(...)

a:hover, .jiactive { background-color: red; color: purple;
}

header ! :nth-child(3) { font-size: 24px;
}

:nth-child(odd) { background-color: gray;
}

Summary
Pseudo-class selectors are very powerful 
Make sure your selector is still readable
Simple/Readable > Complicated/Tricky

207 Lecture 16: Style Placement5m
Summary
Placing styles inline is great for quick testing Real sites almost always use external styles Head styles are usually there to override external

208 Lecture 17, Part 1: Conflict Resolution8m
Some Concepts
origin
marge
inheritance
specificity

Origin Precedence (when in conflict)
simple rule
Last Declaration Wins
Remember, HTML is processed sequentially, top to bottom.
For precedence, think of external CSS as declared at the spot where it’s linked to.

209 Lecture 17, Part 2: Conflict Resolution6m
Most Specific
Selector Combination Wins
Summary
Cascade: origin, merge; Inheritance, & Specificity

Provide precise control over targeting content while allowing maximum re-use of styles across your website

210 Lecture 18, Part 1: Styling Text6m
font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
color: #0000ff; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; text-transform: capitalize;

211 Lecture 18, Part 2: Styling Text5m
<div style="font-size: 2em;">2em text 
 <div style="font-size: 2em;">4em text 
  <div style="font-size: .5em;">2em again!</div>
 </div>
</div>

212 Lecture 19, Part 1: The Box Model10m
background-color: blue; padding: 20px 30px 10px 30px;
border: 20px solid black; margin: 40px;
width: 300px;
box-sizing: border-box;

213 Lecture 19, Part 2: The Box Model7m
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: *0; 
  padding: 0;
}

214 Lecture 19, Part 3: The Box Model5m
overflow: auto;

Summary
Box model - essential to understand
 Prefer box-sizing: border-box

The * (universal) selector 
Cumulative and collapsing margins 
Content overflow

215 Lecture 20: The background Property6m
background: url('yaakov.png') no-repeat right center blue;

Summary
Background property and its sub properties
-image
-color
-position
etc.

Can get pretty complex and is used for adjusting image size/resolution based on screen size

216 Lecture 21: Positioning Elements by Floating10m
Summary
Floating elements can produce very flexible layouts

Floats are taken out of normal document flow

Floats don’t have vertical margin collapse

To resume normal document flow, use the clear property

217 Lecture 22, Part 1: Relative and Absolute Element Positioning7m
Static Positioning
Normal document flow. Default for all, except html.
Positioning offsets are ignored

Relative Positioning
Element is positioned relative to its position

in normal document flow.

Positioning CSS (offset) properties are:
top, bottom, left, right

Element is NOT taken out of normal document flow
Even if moved, its original spot is preserved

p {
  position: relative; 
  top 50px; 
  left 50px;
}

Absolute Positioning
All offsets (top, bottom, left, right) are relative to the position of the nearest ancestor which has positioning set on it, other than static.

By default, html is the only element that has non-static positioning set on it (relative).

Element is taken out of normal document flow

218 Lecture 22, Part 2: Relative and Absolute Element Positioning3m

Summary
Static positioning is default for all elements, except html

Relative positioning offsets the element relative to its normal document flow position

Absolute positioning is relative to closest ancestor which has positioning set to non-static value

Offsetting the relative container element offsets its contents as well

219 Lecture 23, Part 1: Media Queries4m

@media (max-width: 767px) {
  p {
  color: blue;
  }
}

Media Query Syntax
Media Query Common Features

@media (max-width: 800px) {...} @media (min-width: 800px)
@media (orientation: portrait) {...} 
@media screen {...}
@media print {...}

@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px) {...}

Comma is equivalent to OR:
@media (max-width: 767px), (min-width: 992px) { ..}

Media Query Common Approach

220 Lecture 23, Part 2: Media Queries9m
Summary
Basic syntax of a media query
@media (media feature)
@media (media feature) logical operator (media feature) Remember not to overlap breakpoints

Usually, you provide base styling
Then, change or add to them in each media query

221 Lecture 24, Part 1: Responsive Design7m
What is a Responsive Web Site?
Site designed to adapt its layout to the viewing environment by using fluid, proportion-based grids, flexible images, and CSS3 media queries

Site’s layout adapts to the size of the device 
Content verbosity or its visual delivery may change

222 Lecture 24, Part 2: Responsive Design11m
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

Summary
Need and idea of responsive design 12-column grid layout
Use % to achieve fluid width (wrt browser width) Viewport meta tag to turn off default mobile zooming

223 Lecture 25, Part 1: Introduction to Twitter Bootstrap5m
What is Bootstrap?
Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

Mobile First == PLAN mobile from the start
CSS Framework is mobile ready

Disadvantages of Bootstrap (vs. Writing Your Own)?

A lot of features you will probably never use 
 Use selective download

You can write your own that’s more targeted/smaller
 But it will take you a LOT longer to write it as well

224 Lecture 25, Part 2: Introduction to Twitter Bootstrap7m

Summary
Intro to the most popular project on GitHub
Mobile First - importance of planning for mobile from the start

Barebones Bootstrap web page

225 Lecture 26, Part 1: The Bootstrap Grid System9m
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-4">col-1</div>
   • • •
  </div>
</div>

226 Lecture 26, Part 2: The Bootstrap Grid System9m
Summary
Structure Bootstrap expects for the grid-based layout

Needs to be include container (or container-fluid)
All columns must be inside .row

SIZE identifier identifies at which breakpoint specified column spans will be ignored and all elements will collapse (i.e., stack)

If no other rules apply, specifying col-xs-... will keep that layout no matter what the size of the screen

300 WEEK3 Coding the Static Restaurant Site
Ready for some REAL fun? This module is it! We'll go over some basics of interacting with a client when managing a web site project and then go visit a real client at their place of business (a Chinese restaurant), help the owner figure out what she wants in a site, and get acquainted with the restaurant in general. We'll spend the rest of the module building a real web site for this business from scratch and you'll get to sit next to me and watch as the site comes together.

400 WEEK4 Introduction to Javascript
What fun would a web site be if there was no functionality to it? In this module, we are going to concentrate on learning the fundamentals of the Javascript language. A lot of even seasoned developers “tinker” with Javascript without really understanding how the language works. That leads to viewing the language as more of a nuisance instead of a powerful tool. That is why we are going to concentrate not only on the “how” but also on the “why”, so you are empowered by the Javascript language features, not confused by them. We’ll cover just about everything - from common language constructs and Javascript types to objects, functions, arrays, closures, and scope isolation.
401 Welcome to Module 4: Introduction to Javascript1m
402 Lecture 40, Part 1: Adjusting Development Environment for Javascript Development5m
403 Lecture 40, Part 2: Where to Place Javascript Code5m
404 Lecture 41, Part 1: Defining Variables, Function, and Scope8m
Scope Chain
Everything is executed in an Execution Context Function invocation creates a new Execution Context
Each Execution Context has:
•	Its own Variable Environment
•	Special ‘this’ object
•	Reference to its Outer Environment
Global scope does not have an Outer Environment as it’s the most outer there is
Referenced (not defined) variable will be searched for in its current scope first. If not found the Outer Reference will be searched.
If not found, the Outer Reference's Outer Reference will be searched, etc.
This will keep going until the Global scope.
If not found in Global scope, the variable is undefined.

405 Lecture 41, Part 2: Defining Variables, Function, and Scope4m
var message = "in global";
console.log('global: message = ' + message);
var a = function () { 
	var message = "inside a"; 
    console.log("a: message = " + message); 
	b();
}

function b () { 
	console.log('b: message = ' + message)
}
global: message = in global
a: message = inside a
b: message = in global
Summary
Defining variables - dynamically typed
Defining functions - creates its own scope (lexical)
JS code runs within an Execution Context
Scope chain is used to retrieve variables from Outer Variable Environments

406 Lecture 42, Part 1: Javascript Types5m
Types
A type is a particular data structure.
Each language defines some built-in types
Built-in types can be used to build other data structures JS has 7 built-in types: 6 primitive and 1 Object type
Primitive type represents a single, immutable value
 Single value, i.e., not an object
 Immutable means once it’s set, it can’t be changed
•	Value becomes read-only
•	You can create another value based on an existing one
Primitive type: Undefined
Undefined signifies that no value has ever been set

Can only have one value: undefined
You can set a variable to undefined, but you should NEVER do it
Its meaning is that it’s never been defined, so defining it to undefined is counter to its core meaning

Primitive type: Null
Null signifies lack of value
As opposed to undefined, which is lack of definition
Can only have one value: null
It’s ok to explicitly set a variable to null

Primitive type: Number
Number is the only numeric
type in Javascript
- Always represented under the hood as double-precision 64-bit floating point
- JS does not have an integer type
• Integers are a subset of doubles instead of a separate data type
Primitive type: String
String is sequence of characters used to represent text
Use either single or double quotes, i.e., ‘text’ or “text”
Primitive type: Symbol
Symbol is new to ES6
Not covered in this class
ES6 (released 2015) isn’t widely supported or used yet

407 Lecture 42, Part 2: Javascript Types4m
var x;
console.log(x);
if (x == undefined) { 
	console.log('x is undefined');
}

x = 5;

if (x == undefined) { 
	console.log('x is undefined');
else {
    console.log("x has been defined");
}
global: message = in global
a: message = inside a
b: message = in global
Summary
Javascript defines 7 built-in types • Object and 6 Primitives
Object type is a collection of name/value pairs
Primitive type can contain a single, immutable value
Undefined means variable memory has been allocated but no value has ever been explicitly set yet

408 Lecture 43, Part 1: Common Language Constructs8m
// ***** Regular math operators: +,	*, /
console.log((5 + 4) / 3);
console.log(undefined / 5);
3
NaN
x = "4"
y = 4
if (x == y) {
  console.log("x='4' is equal to y=4");
}
x='4' is equal to y=4
// ***** Strict equality 
if (x === y) { 
  console.log("Strict: 'x' is equal y")
}
else { 
  console.log("Strict: x='4' is NOT equal y")
}

409 Lecture 43, Part 2: Common Language Constructs4m
// ***** If statement (all false)
if( false || null || undefined || "" || 0 || NaN|) {    
  console.log("This line won't ever execute");
}
else {
  console.log ("All false");
}
// ***** If statement (all true) 
if (true && "hello" && 1 && -1 && "false") {  
  console.log("All true");
}

410 Lecture 43, Part 3: Common Language Constructs7m
function a()
{
  return
  {
    name: "Yaakov"
  }
}
function a()
{
  return {
    name: "Yaakov"
  }
}
undefined
Object {name: "Yaakov"}
// For loop 
var sum = 0;
for(var i=0; i < 10; i+=1) { 
  sum = sum + i;
}
console.log("sum of 0 through 9 is: " + sum);
Summary
String concatenation Math operations Type coercion
Regular (==) and Strict (===) equality What is true and what is false in Javascript Opening curly brace placement (NOT just style) Always place semicolons at the end of statements

  sideDish sideDish "whatever!"; 
  console.log("Chicken with " + sideDish);
}
orderChickenWith("noodles"); 
orderChickenWith()

412 Lecture 45, Part 1: Creating Objects Using 'new Object()' Syntax7m
// Object creation 
var company = new Object();
company.name "Facebook"; 
company.ceo = new Object();
company.ceo.firstName = "Mark"
console.log(company);

414 Lecture 46: Functions Explained8m
// Function factory function 
function makeMultiplier(multiplier) { 
  var myFunc = function (x) { 
  return multiplier * x;
};
  return myFunc;
}
var multiplyBy3 = makeMultiplier(3); console.log(multiplyBy3(10));
30

415 Lecture 47, Part 1: Passing Variables by Value vs. by Reference6m
Passing (or Copying) By Value
Given b=a, passing/copying by value means changing copied value in b does not affect the value stored in a 
and visa versa
Passing (or Copying) By Reference
Given b=a, passing/copying by reference means changing copied value in b does affect the value stored in a and visa versa
In Javascript, primitives are passed by value, objects are passed by reference
“Under the hood”, everything is actually passed by value

416 Lecture 47, Part 2: Passing Variables by Value vs. by Reference7m
var a = { x: 7 };
var b = a;
console.log(a); 
console.log(b);

b.x = 5;
console. log("after") 
console.log(a); 
console.log(b);
{x: 7}
{x: 7}
after
{x: 5}
{x: 5}
Summary
Important! Passing by value vs. passing by reference Simple rule to remember
•	Primitives are passed/copied by value
•	Objects are passed/copied by reference

Question 1
Immediately Invoked Function Expressions are usually used to place code into its own execution context not to conflict with the global scope.
v True
False
Question 2
Given the following code:
 (function(window) {
 var obj = {};
 obj.dreamOn = function () {
  console.log("I want to see the global scope! Let me out!");
 };
 window.doer = obj;
 });
doer.dreamOn();
What (if anything) is missing from this code in order to get it to output the message of the "dreamOn" method?
Nothing is missing. It will output "I want to see the global scope! Let me out!"
Line 1 and Line 9 should use 'global' instead of 'window'.
The function definition in Line 5 is missing an argument. It should accept an argument by the name of 'window'
v The attempted IIFE is not being invoked and passed in the window object. It's missing '(window)' Line 11 right before the semicolon.


500 WEEK5 Using Javascript to Build Web Applications
In this module, we are going to take all those newly learned Javascript language skills and learn how to utilize them within the context of a web page. We’ll start by learning how to properly manipulate the web page components using the Javascript Document Object Model API. We will then move on to learning one of the most popular ways of serving up data to a web site - Ajax. We'll learn about the protocol that the language of the web speaks in (HTTP), how to set up and handle Ajax requests and responses, as well as how to process JSON data. We'll finish the module by connecting our restaurant web site from Module 3 to a real backend service that will allow us to pull the data for the restaurant menu dynamically from the server without having to reload the entire page.

506 Lesson 56: HTTP Basics12m
HyperText Transfer Protocol
Based on request/response stateless protocol
•	Client opens connection to server
•	Client sends HTTP request for a resource
•	Server sends HTTP response to the client (w/resource)
•	Client closes connection to server
Identifying Resources on the Web
URN: Uniform Resource Name
Uniquely identifies resource or name of resource Does not tell us how to get the resource
Identifying Resources on the Web
URI: Uniform Resource Identifier
Uniquely identifies resource or location of resource
Does not necessarily tell us how to get the resource
example:
/official web site/index.html
URL: Uniform Resource Locator
Form of URI that provides info on how to get resource example:
http://www.mysite.com/official_web_site/index.html
HTTP Request Structure(GET)
GET /index.html?firstName=Yaakov HTTP/1.1

HTTP Methods
GET
•	Retrieves the resource
•	Data is passed to server as part of the URI
    l.e., query string
POST
•	Sends data to server in order to be processed
•	Data is sent in the message body
HTTP Request Structure(POST)
POST /index.html HTTP/1.1 
Host: coursera.org 
Accept-Charset: utf-8 
firstName=Yaakov...

Typical HTTP Response
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 11 Aug 2004 19:00:01 GMT 
Content-Type: text/html
<html>
<body>
<hl>Secret to gaining weight REVEALED!</hl> <p>Develop Coursera courses after work at night while eating sweets to keep yourself awake!</p> </body>
</html>

Some Response Status Codes
200 OK
•	Ok, here is the content you requested 404 Not Found
•	Server can’t find the resource requested 403 Forbidden
•	Unauthenticated client tried to access a secure resource 500 Internal Server Error
•	Some unhandled error was raised on the server
Summary
Need to understand the basics of HTTP protocol GET method sends data to server as part of the URL POST method sends data as part of message body Response codes: 200, 404, 500, etc.

507 Lesson 57, Part 1: Ajax Basics5m
Asynchronous Javascript And XML
While Ajax started with XML, very few apps use it nowadays 
• Plain text (at times as html) and JSON is used instead
Traditional Web App Flow
Ajax Web App Flow
Faster response
• Less bandwidth, nicer experience for
Synchronous Execution
Execution of one instruction at a time
Can’t start execution of another instruction until the first instruction finished its execution
Asynchronous Execution
Execution of more than one instruction at a time
Asynchronous instruction returns right away
The actual execution is done in a separate thread or process

510 Lecture 58: Processing JSON9m
JavaScript Object Notation
Lightweight data-interchange format
 Simple textual representation of data
Easy for humans to read and write 
Easy for machines to parse and generate 
Completely independent of any language
JSON syntax rules
Subset of Javascript object literal syntax...
•	Property names must be in double quotes
•	String values must be in double quotes
•	That’s it!
Syntax for everything else is exactly like for object literal
var jsonString =
'{
  "firstName : "Yaakov", 
  "lastName": "Chaikin", 
  "likesChineseFood": false, 
  "numberOfDisplays": 2
}';
Common Misconception
JSON is NOT a Javascript Object Literal
JSON is just a string
The syntax of JSON is based on object literal though
Need to covert JSON into a JS object

Converting JSON To String & Back to JSON
converts from json string to object
var obj = JSON.parse(jsonString)
converts from object to json string
var str = JSON.stringify(obj);

Summary
JSON is a lightweight data representation
Great format for passing data from server to client & back
Syntax is based on Javascript object literal 
• But JSON is NOT JS object literal
JSON.parse to convert from JSON string to object
JSON.stringify to convert from object to JSON string

511 Lecture 59: Fixing Mobile Nav Menu Automatic Collapse6m
$(function () { // Same as document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded"...

  // Same as document.querySelector("#navbarToggle").addEventListener("blur",...
  $("#navbarToggle").blur(function (event) {
    var screenWidth = window.innerWidth;
    if (screenWidth < 768) {
      $("#collapsable-nav").collapse('hide');
    }
  });

  // In Firefox and Safari, the click event doesn't retain the focus
  // on the clicked button. Therefore, the blur event will not fire on
  // user clicking somewhere else in the page and the blur event handler
  // which is set up above will not be called.
  // Refer to issue #28 in the repo.
  // Solution: force focus on the element that the click event fired on
  $("#navbarToggle").click(function (event) {
    $(event.target).focus();
  });
});
