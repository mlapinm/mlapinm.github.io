201 Ќ≈ƒ≈Ћя 2 Pelcgbybtl (Cryptology)
In the second week of this course, we'll learn about cryptology. We'll explore different types of encryption practices and how they work. We'll show you the most common algorithms used in cryptography and how they've evolved over time. By the end of this module, you'll understand how symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and hashing work; you'll also know how to choose the most appropriate cryptographic method for a scenario you may see in the workplace.
202 Cryptography7мин
Cryptography
Encryption

Cryptosystem
A collection of algorithms for key generation and encryption and decryption operations that comprise a cryptographic service should remain secure - even if everything about the system is known, except the key

Shannon's maxim
"The enemy knows the system"

The system should remain secure even if your adversary knows exactly what kind of encryption systems you’re employing, as long as your keys remain secure

Data Encryption Standard
FIPS
Federal Information Processing Standard
Key length
Brute-force attack
NIST
National Institute of Standards & Technology
AES

Both Diffie-Hellmen and DSA have elliptic curve variants, referred to as ECDH and ECDSA, respectively.

208 Hashing3мин
Hashing (or a hash function)
A type of function or operation that takes in an arbitrary data input and maps it to an output of fixed size, called a hash or digest

You feed in any amount of data into a hash function and the resulting output will always be the same size, but the output should be unique to the input, such that two different inputs should never yield the same output.

Hashing can also be used to identify duplicate data sets in databases or archives to speed up searching of tables or to remove duplicate data to save space.

Hashing can also be used to identify duplicate data sets in databases or archives to speed up searching of tables or to remove duplicate data to save space.

Cryptographic hashing is distinctly different from encryption because cryptographic hash functions should be one directional.

The ideal cryptographic hash function should be deterministic, meaning that the same input value should always return the same hash value.

hash collision
The ideal cryptographic hash function should be deterministic, meaning that the same input value should always return the same hash value.
"Hello World" I [hash function] | E49AOOFF
"hello world" I [hash function] | FF1832AE
$ echo 'Hello World' | md5sum e59ff97941044f85df5297e1c302d260

211 Public Key Infrastructure9мин
PKI
Public key infrastructure

INFO ON PUBLIC KEY 
REGISTERED OWNER
DIGITAL SIGNATURE
CA
The entity that's responsible for storing, issuing, and signing certificates is referred to as CA, or Certificate Authority.
RA
Registration authority

A central repository is needed to securely store and index keys, and a certificate management system of some sort makes managing access to stored certificates and issuance of certificates easier.

SSL/TLS server certificate
Self-signed certificate
SSL/TLS client certificate

As the name implies, these are certificates that are bound to clients and are used to authenticate the client to the server, allowing access control to an SSL/TLS service.

This allows users of these signed applications to verify the signatures and ensure that the application was not tampered with.

Root certificate

A certificate that has no authority as a CA is referred to an end-entity or leaf certificate.

The X.509 standard is what defines the format of digital certificates.

version
What version of the X.509 standard the certificate adheres to

Serial number
A unique identifier for the certificate assigned by the CA which allows the CA to manage and identify individual certificates

Certificate Signature Algorithm
This field indicates what public key algorithm is used for the public key and what hashing algorithm is used to sign the certificate

Issuer Name
This field contains information about the authority that signed the certificate

Validity
This contains two subfields - “Not Before and “Not After” - which define the dates when the certificate is valid for
Subject
This field contains identifying information about the entity the certificate was issued to

Subject Public Key Info
These two subfields define the algorithm of the public key, along with the public key itself

Certificate Signature Algorithm
Same as the Subject Public Key Info field; These two fields must match

Certificate Signature Value
The digital signature data itself

Web of trust

212 Cryptography in Action8мин
HTTPS
The secure version of HTTP, the HyperText Transport Protocol
SSL 3.0
TLS 1.2

-1)	A secure communication line, which means data being transmitted is protected from potential eavesdroppers
-2)	The ability to authenticate both parties communicating, though typically only the server is authenticated by the client
-3)	The integrity of communications, meaning there are checks to ensure that messages aren’t lost or altered in transit

The session key is the shared symmetric encryption key used in TLS sessions to encrypt data being sent back and forth.

Secure Shell (SSH)
A secure network protocol that uses encryption to allow access to a network service over unsecured networks

PGP
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
An encryption application that allows authentication of data, along with privacy from third parties, relying upon asymmetric encryption to achieve this

213 Securing Network Traffic6мин
VPN
Virtual private network (VPN)
A mechanism that allows you to remotely connect a host or network to an internal, private network, passing the data over a public channel, like the internet

IPsec

When transport mode is used, only the payload of the IP packet is encrypted, leaving the IP headers untouched.

In tunnel mode, the entire IP packet, header payload and all, is encrypted and encapsulated inside a new IP packet with new headers.

L2TP
Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol

Encapsulating Security Payload

The tunnel is provided by L2TP which permits the passing of unmodified packets from one network to another. The secure channel, on other hand, is provided by IPsec, which provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of data being passed.

226 5 практических упражнений
227 Symmetric Encryption30мин
q2.
Question 1
What are the components that make up a cryptosystem? Check all that apply.
v Decryption algorithms
v Key generation algorithms
v Encryption algorithms
Correct
Great job! A cryptosystem is a collection of algorithms needed to operate an encryption service. This involves generating encryption keys, as well as encryption and decryption operations.
Transmission algorithms
q2.
Question 2
What is steganography?
The practice of encoding messages
The study of languages
The study of stegosauruses
v The practice of hiding messages 
Correct
Yep! Steganography involves hiding messages, but not encoding them.
q3.
Question 3
What makes an encryption algorithm symmetric? 
Different keys used for encryption and decryption
High speed 
The same keys used for encryption and decryption
Very large key sizes
Correct
Awesome! The symmetry of a symmetric algorithm refers to one key being used for both encryption and decryption.
q4.
Question 4
What's the difference between a stream cipher and a block cipher?
There is no difference.
Stream ciphers can't save encrypted data to disk.
Stream ciphers encrypt data as a continuous stream, while block ciphers operate on chunks of data.
Block ciphers are only used for block device encryption.
Correct
You got it! A stream cipher takes data in as a continuous stream, and outputs the ciphertext as a continuous stream, too. A block cipher encrypts the data in chunks, or blocks.
q5.
Question 5
True or false: The smaller the encryption key is, the more secure the encrypted data is.
TRUE
v FALSE
Correct
Nice work! The reverse is true. The larger the key, the more secure the encrypted data will be.

228 Public Key or Asymmetric Encryption30мин
Question 1
Which of the following do asymmetric cryptosystems provide? Check all that apply.
v Confidentiality
Availability
v Non-repudiation
v Authenticity
Correct
Exactly! Confidentiality is provided by the encryption and decryption functionality, while authenticity and non-repudiation are ensured by the signing and verification processes.
Question 2
What advantages do asymmetric algorithms have over symmetric ones? 
They're easier to implement.
v They allow secure communication over insecure channels.
They have very fast performance.
They're more secure.
Correct
Wohoo! By exchanging public keys for encrypting data, asymmetric encryption securely exchanges information over untrusted channels.
Question 3
What's a common application for asymmetric algorithms?
Full disk encryption
Secure password storage
v Secure key exchange
Random number generation
Correct
You nailed it! Asymmetric encryption schemes are perfect for securely exchanging small amounts of data over untrusted networks by exchanging public keys that are used for encrypting data.

229 Hashing30мин
Question 1
How is hashing different from encryption?
It's faster.
It's less secure.
Hashing is meant for large amounts of data, while encryption is meant for small amounts of data.
v Hashing operations are one-directional.
Correct
Great job! Hash functions, by definition, are one-way, meaning that it's not possible to take a hash and recover the input that generated the hash. Encryption, on the other hand, is two-directional, since data can be both encrypted and decrypted.
Question 2
What's a hash collision?
When a hash digest is reversed to recover the original
When two different hashing algorithms produce the same hash
When two different files generate the same hash digest
When two identical files generate different hash digests
Correct
Awesome work! If two different files result in the same hash, this is referred to as a hash collision. Hash collisions aren't awesome, as this would allow an attacker to create a fake file that would pass hash verification.

Question 3
How is a Message Integrity Check (MIC) different from a Message Authentication Code (MAC)?
A MIC is more reliable than a MAC.
A MAC requires a password, while a MIC does not.
v A MIC only hashes the message, while a MAC incorporates a secret key.
They're the same thing.
Correct
That's exactly right! A MIC can be thought of as just a checksum or hash digest of a message, while a MAC uses a shared secret to generate the checksum. This also makes it authenticated, since the other party must also have the same shared secret, preventing a third party from forging the checksum data.
Question 4
How can you defend against brute-force password attacks? Check all that apply.
v Enforce the use of strong passwords.
v Incorporate salts into password hashing.
Store passwords in a rainbow table.
v Run passwords through the hashing function multiple times.
Correct
Correct! A brute-force password attack involves guessing the password. So, having complex and long passwords will make this task much harder and will require more time and resources for the attacker to succeed. Incorporating salts into password hashes will protect against rainbow table attacks, and running passwords through the hashing algorithm lots of times also raises the bar for an attacker, requiring more resources for each password guess.

230 Cryptography Applications30мин
What information does a digital certificate contain? Check all that apply.
v Digital signature
v Identifying information of the certificate owner
v Public key data
Correct
Great job! A digital certificate contains the public key information, along with a digital signature from a CA. It also includes information about the certificate, like the entity that the certificate was issued to.
Private key data
Question 2
Which type of encryption does SSL/TLS use?
Neither
Asymmetric encryption
Symmetric encryption
v Both
Correct
Wohoo! SSL/TLS use asymmetric algorithms to securely exchange information used to derive a symmetric encryption key.
Question 3
What are some of the functions that a Trusted Platform Module can perform? Check all that apply.
v Data binding and sealing
Secure user authentication
v Remote attestation
Correct
You nailed it! A TPM can be used for remote attestation, ensuring that a host is a known good state and hasn't been modified or tampered (from a hardware and a software perspective). TPMs can also seal and bind data to them, encrypting data against the TPM. This also allows it to be decrypted by the TPM, only if the machine is in a good and trusted state.

Logs analysis systems are configured using user-defined rules to match interesting or atypical log entries.

Normalizing log data is an important step, since logs from different devices and systems may not be formatted in a common way.

Correlation analysis
The process of taking log data from different systems and matching events across the systems

WPA
Wi-Fi Protected Access
WPA
Designed as a short-term replacement that would be compatible with older WEP-enabled hardware with a simple firmware update
TKIP
Temporal Key Integrity Protocol

Under WPA, the pre-shared key is the Wifi password you share with people when they come over and want to use your wireless network.

password-Based Key Derivation Function 2

CCMP
Counter Mode CBC

408 Wireless Hardening3мин
802.1X with EAP-TLS
If 802.1X is too complicated for a company, the next best alternative would be WPA2 with AES/CCMP mode.

A long and complex passphrase that wouldn’t be found in a dictionary would increase the amount of time and resources an attacker would need to break the passphrase.

If your company values security over convenience, you should make sure that WPS isn’t enabled on your APs.

501 Ќ≈ƒ≈Ћя 5 Defense in Depth
In the fifth week of this course, we're going to go more in-depth into security defense. We'll cover ways to implement methods for system hardening, application hardening, and determine the policies for OS security. By the end of this module, you'll know why it's important to disable unnecessary components of a system, learn about host-based firewalls, setup anti-malware protection, implement disk encryption, and configure software patch management and application policies.
502 Intro to Defense in Depth1мин
Defense in depth
The concept of having multiple, overlapping systems of defense to protect IT systems

503 Disabling Unnecessary Components4мин
System Hardening
0-day vulnerabilities
Attack vectors
Attack surfaces

Attack vector
The method or mechanism by which an attacker or malware gains access to a network or system

Attack surface
The sum of all the different attack vectors in a given system

The less complex something is, the less likely there will be undetected flaws.

Another way to keep things simple is to reduce your software deployments.

Telnet access for a managed switch has no business being enabled in a real-world environment.

504 Host-Based Firewall4мин
System Hardening

Host-based firewalls
Protect individual hosts from being compromised when they’re used in untrusted, potentially malicious environments.

A host-based firewall plays a big part in reducing what’s accessible to an outside attacker.

Bastion hosts or networks

If the users of the system have administrator rights, then they have the ability to change firewall rules and configurations.

505 Logging and Auditing7мин
Logging and Auditing

Security information and event management systems
SIEMS

Normalization

Once logs are centralized and standardized, you can write automated alerting based on rules.

SIEM

rsyslog
Splunk Enterprise Security
IBM Security Qradar
RSA Security Analytics

506 Antimalware Protection7мин
Antivirus software will monitor and analyze things, like new files being created or being modified on the system, in order to watch for any behavior that matches a known malware signature.

It protects against the most common attacks out there on the internet.

Antivirus software is just one piece of our anti-malware defenses.

Binary whitelisting software

507 Disk Encryption6мин
System Hardening

Full-disk encryption (FDE)
Works by automatically converting data on a hard drive into a form that cannot be understood by anyone who doesn't have the key to "undo" the conversation

Secure Boot Protocol
Platform key

Bitlocker
Filevault 2
dm-crypt
TrueCrypt
VeraCrypt

When you implement a full disk encryption solution at scale, it’s super important to think about how to handle cases where passwords are forgotten.

Key Escrow
Allows the encryption key to be securely stored for later retrieval by an authorized party

Home directory or file-based encryption
only guarantees confidentiality and integrity of files protected by encryption.

508 Heather Self Learning1мин
509 Software Patch Management6мин
Application Hardening

As an IT Support Specialist, its critical that you make sure that you install software updates and security patches in a timely way, in order to defend your company's systems and networks.

The best protection is to have a good system and policy in place for your company.

SCCM

Critical infrastructure devices should be approached carefully when you apply updates. There’s always the risk that a software update will introduce a new bug that might affect the functionality of the device.

510 Application Policies4мин
Application Hardening

A common recommendation, or even a requirement, is to only support or require the latest version of a piece of software.

It’s generally a good idea to disallow risky classes of software by policy. Things like file sharing software and piracy-related software tend to be closely associated with malware infections.

Understanding what your users need to
do their jobs will help shape your approach to software policies and guidelines.

Helping your users accomplish tasks by recommending or supporting specific software makes for a more secure environment.

Extensions that require full access to web sites visited can be risky, since the extension developer has the power to modify pages visited.

601 Ќ≈ƒ≈Ћя 6 Creating a Company Culture for Security
Congratulations, you've made it to the final week in the course! In the last week of this course, we'll explore ways to create a company culture for security. It's important for any tech role to determine appropriate measures to meet the three goals of security. By the end of this module, you will develop a security plan for an organization to demonstrate the skills you've learned in this course. You're almost done, keep up the great work!

602 Security Goals7мин
Risk in the Workplace

If your company handles credit card payments, then you have to follow the PCI DSS, or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.

-1. Build and maintain a secure network and systems.
-2. Protect cardholder data.
-3. Maintain a vulnerability management program.
-4. Implement strong access control measures.
-5. Regularly monitor and test networks.
-6. Maintain an information security policy.

603 Measuring and Assessing Risk5мин
Risk in the Workplace

Security is all about determining risks or exposure; understanding the likelihood of attacks; and designing defenses around these risks to minimize the impact of an attack.

Security risk assessment starts with threat modeling.

High-value data usually includes account information, like usernames and passwords. Typically, any kind of user data is considered high value, especially if payment processing is involved.

Vulnerability Scanner
A computer program designed to assess computers, computer systems, networks or applications for weaknesses

Nessus
OpenVAS
Qualys

Penetration testing
The practice of attempting to break into system or network to verify the systems in place

604 Privacy Policy3мин
Risk in the Workplace

Privacy policies oversee the access and use of sensitive data.

Доступ
Правмерный
Не правомерный
Ограничения

Политики
конфиденциальности
доступа

It's a good practice to apply the principle of least privilege here, by not allowing access to this type of data by default.

Запрашивать доступ
Зачем нужны данные
Какая нужна информация
На какое время


Any access that doesn’t have a corresponding request should be flagged as a high-priority potential breach that needs to be investigated as soon as possible.

Data-handling policies should cover the details of how different data is classified.

Once different data classes are defined, you should create guidelines around how to handle these different types of data.

605 User Habits6мин
Users

You can build the world's best security systems, but they won't protect you if the users are going to be practicing unsafe security.

You should never upload confidential information onto a third-party service that hasn’t been evaluated by your company.

It's important to make sure employees use new and unique passwords, and don’t reuse them from other services.

A much greater risk in the workplace that users should be educated on is credential theft from phishing emails.

If someone entered their password into a phishing site, or even suspects they did, it s important to change their password as soon as possible.

606 Third-Party Security4мин
Users

If they have subpar security, you’re undermining your security defenses by potentially opening a new avenue of attack.

If you can, ask for a third-party security assessment report.

609 Incident Reporting and Analysis6мин
Incident Handling

The very first step of handling an incident is to detect it in the first place.

The next step is to analyze it and determine
the effects and scope of damage.

spinel% sudo tcpdump any -i

spinel% sudo tcpdump -i enol ip and host example.com [sudo] password for mrant:

tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode listening on enol, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes

spinel% curl example.com

Once the scope of the incident is determined, the next step is containment.

If an account was compromised, change the password immediately. If the owner is unable to change the password right away, then lock the account.

Severity includes factors like what and how many systems were compromised, and how the breach affects business functions.

Severity includes factors like what and how many systems were compromised, and how the breach affects business functions.

The impact of an incident is also an important issue to consider.

Data exfiltration
The unauthorized transfer of data from computer

Recoverability
How complicated and time-consuming the recovery effort will be

610 Incident Response and Recovery6мин
Incident Handling

Update firewall rules and ACLs if an exposure was discovered in the course the investigation.

Create new definitions and rules for intrusion detection systems that can watch for the signs of the same attack again.
