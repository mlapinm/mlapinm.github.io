201 Ќ≈ƒ≈Ћя 2 Pelcgbybtl (Cryptology)
In the second week of this course, we'll learn about cryptology. We'll explore different types of encryption practices and how they work. We'll show you the most common algorithms used in cryptography and how they've evolved over time. By the end of this module, you'll understand how symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and hashing work; you'll also know how to choose the most appropriate cryptographic method for a scenario you may see in the workplace.
202 Cryptography7мин
Cryptography
Encryption

Kerchoff's principle

Cryptosystem
A collection of algorithms for key generation and encryption and decryption operations that comprise a cryptographic service should remain secure - even if everything about the system is known, except the key

Shannon's maxim
"The enemy knows the system"

The system should remain secure even if your adversary knows exactly what kind of encryption systems you’re employing, as long as your keys remain secure

Data Encryption Standard
FIPS
Federal Information Processing Standard
Key length
Brute-force attack
NIST
National Institute of Standards & Technology
AES

Both Diffie-Hellmen and DSA have elliptic curve variants, referred to as ECDH and ECDSA, respectively.

208 Hashing3мин
Hashing (or a hash function)
A type of function or operation that takes in an arbitrary data input and maps it to an output of fixed size, called a hash or digest

You feed in any amount of data into a hash function and the resulting output will always be the same size, but the output should be unique to the input, such that two different inputs should never yield the same output.

Hashing can also be used to identify duplicate data sets in databases or archives to speed up searching of tables or to remove duplicate data to save space.

Hashing can also be used to identify duplicate data sets in databases or archives to speed up searching of tables or to remove duplicate data to save space.

Cryptographic hashing is distinctly different from encryption because cryptographic hash functions should be one directional.

The ideal cryptographic hash function should be deterministic, meaning that the same input value should always return the same hash value.

hash collision
The ideal cryptographic hash function should be deterministic, meaning that the same input value should always return the same hash value.
"Hello World" I [hash function] | E49AOOFF
"hello world" I [hash function] | FF1832AE
$ echo 'Hello World' | md5sum e59ff97941044f85df5297e1c302d260

211 Public Key Infrastructure9мин
PKI
Public key infrastructure

INFO ON PUBLIC KEY 
REGISTERED OWNER
DIGITAL SIGNATURE
CA
The entity that's responsible for storing, issuing, and signing certificates is referred to as CA, or Certificate Authority.
RA
Registration authority

A central repository is needed to securely store and index keys, and a certificate management system of some sort makes managing access to stored certificates and issuance of certificates easier.

SSL/TLS server certificate
Self-signed certificate
SSL/TLS client certificate

As the name implies, these are certificates that are bound to clients and are used to authenticate the client to the server, allowing access control to an SSL/TLS service.

This allows users of these signed applications to verify the signatures and ensure that the application was not tampered with.

Root certificate

A certificate that has no authority as a CA is referred to an end-entity or leaf certificate.

The X.509 standard is what defines the format of digital certificates.

version
What version of the X.509 standard the certificate adheres to

Serial number
A unique identifier for the certificate assigned by the CA which allows the CA to manage and identify individual certificates

Certificate Signature Algorithm
This field indicates what public key algorithm is used for the public key and what hashing algorithm is used to sign the certificate

Issuer Name
This field contains information about the authority that signed the certificate

Validity
This contains two subfields - “Not Before and “Not After” - which define the dates when the certificate is valid for
Subject
This field contains identifying information about the entity the certificate was issued to

Subject Public Key Info
These two subfields define the algorithm of the public key, along with the public key itself

Certificate Signature Algorithm
Same as the Subject Public Key Info field; These two fields must match

Certificate Signature Value
The digital signature data itself

Web of trust

212 Cryptography in Action8мин
HTTPS
The secure version of HTTP, the HyperText Transport Protocol
SSL 3.0
TLS 1.2

-1)	A secure communication line, which means data being transmitted is protected from potential eavesdroppers
-2)	The ability to authenticate both parties communicating, though typically only the server is authenticated by the client
-3)	The integrity of communications, meaning there are checks to ensure that messages aren’t lost or altered in transit

The session key is the shared symmetric encryption key used in TLS sessions to encrypt data being sent back and forth.

Secure Shell (SSH)
A secure network protocol that uses encryption to allow access to a network service over unsecured networks

PGP
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
An encryption application that allows authentication of data, along with privacy from third parties, relying upon asymmetric encryption to achieve this

213 Securing Network Traffic6мин
VPN
Virtual private network (VPN)
A mechanism that allows you to remotely connect a host or network to an internal, private network, passing the data over a public channel, like the internet

IPsec

When transport mode is used, only the payload of the IP packet is encrypted, leaving the IP headers untouched.

In tunnel mode, the entire IP packet, header payload and all, is encrypted and encapsulated inside a new IP packet with new headers.

L2TP
Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol

Encapsulating Security Payload

The tunnel is provided by L2TP which permits the passing of unmodified packets from one network to another. The secure channel, on other hand, is provided by IPsec, which provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of data being passed.

OpenVPN can operate over either TCP or UDP, typically over port 1194.

226 5 практических упражнений
227 Symmetric Encryption30мин
q2.
Question 1
What are the components that make up a cryptosystem? Check all that apply.
v Decryption algorithms
v Key generation algorithms
v Encryption algorithms
Correct
Great job! A cryptosystem is a collection of algorithms needed to operate an encryption service. This involves generating encryption keys, as well as encryption and decryption operations.
Transmission algorithms
q2.
Question 2
What is steganography?
The practice of encoding messages
The study of languages
The study of stegosauruses
v The practice of hiding messages 
Correct
Yep! Steganography involves hiding messages, but not encoding them.
q3.
Question 3
What makes an encryption algorithm symmetric? 
Different keys used for encryption and decryption
High speed 
The same keys used for encryption and decryption
Very large key sizes
Correct
Awesome! The symmetry of a symmetric algorithm refers to one key being used for both encryption and decryption.
q4.
Question 4
What's the difference between a stream cipher and a block cipher?
There is no difference.
Stream ciphers can't save encrypted data to disk.
Stream ciphers encrypt data as a continuous stream, while block ciphers operate on chunks of data.
Block ciphers are only used for block device encryption.
Correct
You got it! A stream cipher takes data in as a continuous stream, and outputs the ciphertext as a continuous stream, too. A block cipher encrypts the data in chunks, or blocks.
q5.
Question 5
True or false: The smaller the encryption key is, the more secure the encrypted data is.
TRUE
v FALSE
Correct
Nice work! The reverse is true. The larger the key, the more secure the encrypted data will be.

228 Public Key or Asymmetric Encryption30мин
Question 1
Which of the following do asymmetric cryptosystems provide? Check all that apply.
v Confidentiality
Availability
v Non-repudiation
v Authenticity
Correct
Exactly! Confidentiality is provided by the encryption and decryption functionality, while authenticity and non-repudiation are ensured by the signing and verification processes.
Question 2
What advantages do asymmetric algorithms have over symmetric ones? 
They're easier to implement.
v They allow secure communication over insecure channels.
They have very fast performance.
They're more secure.
Correct
Wohoo! By exchanging public keys for encrypting data, asymmetric encryption securely exchanges information over untrusted channels.
Question 3
What's a common application for asymmetric algorithms?
Full disk encryption
Secure password storage
v Secure key exchange
Random number generation
Correct
You nailed it! Asymmetric encryption schemes are perfect for securely exchanging small amounts of data over untrusted networks by exchanging public keys that are used for encrypting data.

229 Hashing30мин
Question 1
How is hashing different from encryption?
It's faster.
It's less secure.
Hashing is meant for large amounts of data, while encryption is meant for small amounts of data.
v Hashing operations are one-directional.
Correct
Great job! Hash functions, by definition, are one-way, meaning that it's not possible to take a hash and recover the input that generated the hash. Encryption, on the other hand, is two-directional, since data can be both encrypted and decrypted.
Question 2
What's a hash collision?
When a hash digest is reversed to recover the original
When two different hashing algorithms produce the same hash
When two different files generate the same hash digest
When two identical files generate different hash digests
Correct
Awesome work! If two different files result in the same hash, this is referred to as a hash collision. Hash collisions aren't awesome, as this would allow an attacker to create a fake file that would pass hash verification.

Question 3
How is a Message Integrity Check (MIC) different from a Message Authentication Code (MAC)?
A MIC is more reliable than a MAC.
A MAC requires a password, while a MIC does not.
v A MIC only hashes the message, while a MAC incorporates a secret key.
They're the same thing.
Correct
That's exactly right! A MIC can be thought of as just a checksum or hash digest of a message, while a MAC uses a shared secret to generate the checksum. This also makes it authenticated, since the other party must also have the same shared secret, preventing a third party from forging the checksum data.
Question 4
How can you defend against brute-force password attacks? Check all that apply.
v Enforce the use of strong passwords.
v Incorporate salts into password hashing.
Store passwords in a rainbow table.
v Run passwords through the hashing function multiple times.
Correct
Correct! A brute-force password attack involves guessing the password. So, having complex and long passwords will make this task much harder and will require more time and resources for the attacker to succeed. Incorporating salts into password hashes will protect against rainbow table attacks, and running passwords through the hashing algorithm lots of times also raises the bar for an attacker, requiring more resources for each password guess.

230 Cryptography Applications30мин
What information does a digital certificate contain? Check all that apply.
v Digital signature
v Identifying information of the certificate owner
v Public key data
Correct
Great job! A digital certificate contains the public key information, along with a digital signature from a CA. It also includes information about the certificate, like the entity that the certificate was issued to.
Private key data
Question 2
Which type of encryption does SSL/TLS use?
Neither
Asymmetric encryption
Symmetric encryption
v Both
Correct
Wohoo! SSL/TLS use asymmetric algorithms to securely exchange information used to derive a symmetric encryption key.
Question 3
What are some of the functions that a Trusted Platform Module can perform? Check all that apply.
v Data binding and sealing
Secure user authentication
v Remote attestation
Correct
You nailed it! A TPM can be used for remote attestation, ensuring that a host is a known good state and hasn't been modified or tampered (from a hardware and a software perspective). TPMs can also seal and bind data to them, encrypting data against the TPM. This also allows it to be decrypted by the TPM, only if the machine is in a good and trusted state.
