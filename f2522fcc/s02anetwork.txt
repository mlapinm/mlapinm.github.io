101 Week1 Introduction to Networking
Welcome to the Networking course of the IT Support Professional Certificate! In the first week of this course, we will cover the basics of computer networking. We will learn about the TCP/IP and OSI networking models and how the network layers work together. We'll also cover the basics of networking devices such as cables, hubs and switches, routers, servers and clients. We'll also explore the physical layer and data link layer of our networking model in more detail. By the end of this module, you will know how all the different layers of the network model fit together to create a network.

103 The TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model5мин
Physical layer
Represents the physecal devices that interconnect computers
Data link layer
Responsible for difining a common way of interpretion these signals so network devices can communicate
The Ethernet standards also devine a protocol responsible for getting data to nodes on the same network or link.
Network layer
Allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers
Internetwork
A collection of networks connected together through routers, the most famous of these being the Internet
IP is the heart of the Internet and most smaller networks around the world.
Transport layer
Sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data
104 Alex Why Networking1мин
105 Cables4мин
Cables
Connect different devices to each other, allowing data to be transmitted over them
Coper
Fiber
The most common forms of copper twisted-pair cables used in networking are Cat5, Cat5e, and Cat6 cables.
Crosstalk
When an electrical pulse on one wire is accidentally detected on another wire
106 Hubs and Switches2мин
Hub
A physical layer device that allows for connections from many computers at once
Collision domain
A network segent where only one device can communicate at a time
If multiple systems try sending data at the same time, the electrical pulses sent across the cable can interfer with each other.
Network switch
Hubs and switches
The primary devices used to connect computers on a single network, usually refferred to as a LAN, or local area netork
107 Routers2мин
Router
A device that knows how to forward data between independent netowrks
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
Routers share data with each other via this protoco, which lets them learn about tho most optimal paths to forward traffic.
108 Servers and Clients1мин

109 Sergio Being A Network Engineer1мин
snapchat, google search
110 Moving Bits Across the Wire2мин
Bits
Modulation
A way of varying the voltage of this charge moving across the cable
111 Twisted Pair Cabling and Duplexing1мин
Duplex communication
The concept that information can flow in both directions across the cable
Simplex communication
This process is unidirectional
112 Network Ports and Patch Panels2мин
RJ45 port
RJ45 plug
Network ports are generally directly attached to the devices that make up a computer network
Link LED
Activity LED
113 Ethernet and MAC Addresses6мин
CSMA/CD
Used to determine when the communications channels are clear, and when a device is free to transmit data
MAC address
A globally unique identifier attached to an individual network interface
It's a 48-bit number normally represented by six groupings of two hexadecimal numbers.
Hexadecimal
A way to represent numbers using 16 digits
Octet
In computer networking, any number that can be represented by 8 bit
Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)
The first three octets of a MAC address
Vendor Assigned (NIC Cards, Interfaces)
Ethernet uses MAC Addresses to ensure that the data it sends has both an address for the machine that sent the transmission, as well as the one the transmission was intended for.
114 Unicast, Multicast, and Broadcast1мин
https://www.coursera.org/lecture/computer-networking/unicast-multicast-and-broadcast-OpIS6
A unicast transmission is always meant for just one receiving address.
If the least significnt bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to zero, it means that ethernet frame is intended for only the destination address.
If the least sihnificant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to one, it means yu're dealing with a multicast frame.
Broadcast all FFFF
ARP
115 Dissecting an Ethernet Frame5мин
Data packet
An all-encompassing term that represents any single set of binary data being sent across a network link
Ethernet frames
A highly structured collection of information presented in a specific order
Preamble 8 bytes
Destination Address 6
Source Address 6
Tag 4
Ether-type 2
Payload 0-1500
FCS 4
Preamble 8 bytes
can itself be split into two sections
for syncronise inner clocks
last byte 
SFD Start frame delimiter
Signals to a receimeng device that the preamble is over and that the actual frame contents will now follow
Destination Address 6
The hardware address of the intended recipient

Source Address 6
VLAN Tag 4
Indicates that the frame itself is what's called a VLAN frame
If a VLAN header is present, the EtherType field follows it.
Virtual LAN (VLAN)
A technique that lets you have multiple logical LANs operation on the same physical equipment
Ether-type 2
used to describe the protocol of the contents of the frame
Payload 46-1500
In networking terms, is the actual data being transported, which is everything that isn't a header
FCS 4
Frame Check Sequence
A 4-byte(0r32-bit) number that represents a checksum value for the entire frame
This checksum value is calculated by performing what's known as a cyclical redundancy check against the frame.
Cyclical Redundancy Check(CRC)
An important concept for data integrity, and is used all over computing, not just network transmissions

201 Week2 The Network Layer
In the second week of this course, we'll explore the network layer in more depth. We'll learn about the IP addressing scheme and how subnetting works. We'll explore how encapsulation works and how protocols such as ARP allow different layers of the network to communicate. We'll also cover the basics of routing, routing protocols, and how the Internet works. By the end of this module, you'll be able to describe the IP addressing scheme, understand how subnetting works, perform binary math to describe subnets, and understand how the Internet works.
202 Introduction to The Network Layer1мин
203 The Network Layer1мин
ARP
Address Resolution Protocol
204 IP Addresses2мин
Dotted decimal notation
9... IBM
IP addresses belong to networks, not to the devices attached to those networks.
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
DHCP
Dynamic IP address
Static IP address
In most cases, static IP addresses are reserved for servers and network devices, while dynamic IP addresses are reserved for clients
205 IP Datagrams and Encapsulation6мин
IP datagram
A highly structured series of fields that are strictly defined
The most common version of IP is version 4, or IPv4.
Header Length field
Almost always 20 bytes in length when dealing with IPv4
Service Type field
These 8 bits can be used to specify details about quality of service, or QoS, technologies
Total Length field
Indicates the total length of the IP datagram it's attached to
Identification field
A 16-bit number that's used to group messages together
The maximum size of a single datagram is the largest number you can represent  with 16 bits: 65535
If the total amount of data that needs to be sent is larger than what can fit in a single datagram, the IP layer needs to split this data up into many individual packets.
Use to indicate if a datagram is allowed to be fragmented, or to indicate that the datagram has already been fragmented
Fragmentation
The process of taking a single IP datagram and splitting it up into several saller datagrams
Time to Live (TTL) field
An 8-bit field that indicates how many router hops a datagram can traverse before it's thrown away
Protocol field
Another 8-bit field that contains data about what transport layer protocol is being used
TCP UDP
Header checksum field
A checksum of the contents of the entire IP datagram header
IP options field
An optional field and is used to set special chracteristics for datagrams primarily used for testing purposes
Padding field
A series of zeros used to ensure the header is the correct total size
Data payload section
Encapsulation
206 IP Address Classes3мин
IP addresses can be split into two sections: 
the network ID and the host ID.
Address class system
A way of defining how the global IP address space is split up
a 1, b 2, c 3
A 0-126
B 128-191
C 192-224
D 224-239
E 240-255
CIDR
Classless inter-domain routing
207 Address Resolution Protocol2мин
ARP
Address resolution protocol
A protocol used to discover the hardware address of a node with a certain IP address
ARP table
A list of IP addresses and the MAC addresses associated with them
ARP table entries generally expire after a short amount of time to ensure changes in the network are accounted for.
208 Sergio Path1мин
209 Subnetting2мин
Subnetting
The process of taking a large network and splitting it up into many individual and smaller subnetworks, or subnets
CIDR
Incorrect subnetting setups are a common problem you might run into as an IT Support Specialist, so it's important to have a strong understanding of how this works.
