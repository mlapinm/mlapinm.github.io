101 Week1 Introduction to Networking
Welcome to the Networking course of the IT Support Professional Certificate! In the first week of this course, we will cover the basics of computer networking. We will learn about the TCP/IP and OSI networking models and how the network layers work together. We'll also cover the basics of networking devices such as cables, hubs and switches, routers, servers and clients. We'll also explore the physical layer and data link layer of our networking model in more detail. By the end of this module, you will know how all the different layers of the network model fit together to create a network.

A network segent where only one device can communicate at a time
If multiple systems try sending data at the same time, the electrical pulses sent across the cable can interfer with each other.
Network switch
Hubs and switches
The primary devices used to connect computers on a single network, usually refferred to as a LAN, or local area netork
107 Routers2мин
Router
A device that knows how to forward data between independent netowrks
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
Routers share data with each other via this protoco, which lets them learn about tho most optimal paths to forward traffic.
108 Servers and Clients1мин

109 Sergio Being A Network Engineer1мин
snapchat, google search
110 Moving Bits Across the Wire2мин
Bits

MAC address
A globally unique identifier attached to an individual network interface
It's a 48-bit number normally represented by six groupings of two hexadecimal numbers.
Hexadecimal
A way to represent numbers using 16 digits
Octet
In computer networking, any number that can be represented by 8 bit
Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)
The first three octets of a MAC address
Vendor Assigned (NIC Cards, Interfaces)
Ethernet uses MAC Addresses to ensure that the data it sends has both an address for the machine that sent the transmission, as well as the one the transmission was intended for.
114 Unicast, Multicast, and Broadcast1мин
https://www.coursera.org/lecture/computer-networking/unicast-multicast-and-broadcast-OpIS6
A unicast transmission is always meant for just one receiving address.
If the least significnt bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to zero, it means that ethernet frame is intended for only the destination address.
If the least sihnificant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to one, it means yu're dealing with a multicast frame.
Broadcast all FFFF
ARP
115 Dissecting an Ethernet Frame5мин

FCS 4
Frame Check Sequence
A 4-byte(0r32-bit) number that represents a checksum value for the entire frame
This checksum value is calculated by performing what's known as a cyclical redundancy check against the frame.
Cyclical Redundancy Check(CRC)
An important concept for data integrity, and is used all over computing, not just network transmissions

202 Introduction to The Network Layer1мин
203 The Network Layer1мин
ARP
Address Resolution Protocol
204 IP Addresses2мин
Dotted decimal notation
9... IBM
IP addresses belong to networks, not to the devices attached to those networks.
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
DHCP
Dynamic IP address
Static IP address
In most cases, static IP addresses are reserved for servers and network devices, while dynamic IP addresses are reserved for clients
205 IP Datagrams and Encapsulation6мин
IP datagram
A highly structured series of fields that are strictly defined
The most common version of IP is version 4, or IPv4.
Header Length field
Almost always 20 bytes in length when dealing with IPv4
Service Type field
These 8 bits can be used to specify details about quality of service, or QoS, technologies
Total Length field
Indicates the total length of the IP datagram it's attached to
Identification field
A 16-bit number that's used to group messages together
The maximum size of a single datagram is the largest number you can represent  with 16 bits: 65535
If the total amount of data that needs to be sent is larger than what can fit in a single datagram, the IP layer needs to split this data up into many individual packets.
Use to indicate if a datagram is allowed to be fragmented, or to indicate that the datagram has already been fragmented
Fragmentation
The process of taking a single IP datagram and splitting it up into several saller datagrams
Time to Live (TTL) field
An 8-bit field that indicates how many router hops a datagram can traverse before it's thrown away
Protocol field
Another 8-bit field that contains data about what transport layer protocol is being used
TCP UDP
Header checksum field
A checksum of the contents of the entire IP datagram header
IP options field
An optional field and is used to set special chracteristics for datagrams primarily used for testing purposes
Padding field
A series of zeros used to ensure the header is the correct total size
Data payload section
Encapsulation
206 IP Address Classes3мин
IP addresses can be split into two sections: 
the network ID and the host ID.
Address class system
A way of defining how the global IP address space is split up
a 1, b 2, c 3
A 0-126
B 128-191
C 192-224
D 224-239
E 240-255
CIDR
Classless inter-domain routing
207 Address Resolution Protocol2мин
ARP
Address resolution protocol
A protocol used to discover the hardware address of a node with a certain IP address
ARP table
A list of IP addresses and the MAC addresses associated with them
ARP table entries generally expire after a short amount of time to ensure changes in the network are accounted for.
208 Sergio Path1мин
209 Subnetting2мин
Subnetting
The process of taking a large network and splitting it up into many individual and smaller subnetworks, or subnets
CIDR
Incorrect subnetting setups are a common problem you might run into as an IT Support Specialist, so it's important to have a strong understanding of how this works.
210 Subnet Masks7мин
subnet ID
Subnet masks
32-bit numbers that are normally written out as four octets in decimal
211 Basic Binary Math6мин
Subnet mask
A way for a computer to use and operators to determine if an IP address exists on the same network
212 CIDR4мин
Classless Inter-Domain Routing
Demarcate
Demarcation point
To describe where one network or system ends and another one begins
213 Motivation1мин
214 Basic Routing Concepts8мин
Router
A network device that forwards traffic depending on the destination address of that traffic
215 Routing Tables3мин
216 Interior Gateway Protocols5мин
Routing protocols
Routing protocols fall into two main categories: interior gateway protocols and exterior gateway protocols.
Interior gateway protocols are further split into two categories: Link state routing protocols and distance-vector protocols.
Interior gateway protocols
Used by routers to share information within a single autonomous system.
Autonomous system
A collection of networks that all fall under the control of a single network operator
The two main types of interior gateway protocols are link state routing protocols and distance-vector protocols.
In computer science, a list is known as a vector
217 Exterior Gateway Protocols3мин
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority(IANA)
A non-profit organization that helps manage things like IP address allocation
Along with managing IP address allocation, the IANA is also responsible for ASN, or Autonomous System Number allocation.
Autonomous System Number (ASN)
Numbers assigned to individual autonomous systems
218 Non-Routable Address Space3мин
This means that the IPv4 standard doesn't even have enough IP addresses available for every person on the planet.

Your submission must include a detailed explanation of the following:

Physical layer

Data link layer

Network layer

Transport layer

MAC address

IP address

TCP port

Checksum check

Routing table

319 The Five-Layer Network Model2ч

There are networks network A 192.168.1.0/24 and network B 176.16.1.0/24. 
The router 1 has adresses 192.168.1.1 and 176.16.1.1.
The router 1 has Routing table with two networks A and B.
The clients computer 1 is 192.168.1.100.
The host 2 has address 176.16.1.100.
The client does http request to IP address 176.16.1.100 on port 80.
The client opens socket TCP and does TCP segment at Transport layer:
source port 50000
destination port 80
control flags SYN
data payload - request
CRC
Then on IP layer IP be making IP Datagram
destination port 1 
Transport layer passes to Data link layer this segment.
Network layer does IP Datagram with TTL: 64, source IP Address 192.168.1.100, Destination IP Address 172.16.1.100,
protocol TCP, CRC and payload TCP segment.
Data link layer does not have in ARP table MAC address of 172.16.1.100. It does frame with MAC address router 1 192.168.1.1 and send it on Physical layer CAT6 cables.
Router 1 sees this frame and Checksum check.
It get IP datagram and sees IP address destination.
It find in Routing table MAC address destination and send frame to server.
Server has open TCP port 80


401 Week4 Networking Services
In the fourth week of this course, we'll explore networking services. We'll learn about why we need DNS and how it works. We'll also show you why DHCP makes network administration a simpler task. By the end of this module, you'll be able to do describe how DNS and DHCP work, how NAT technologies help keep networks secure, and how VPNs and proxies help users connect and stay secured.
402 Introduction to Network Services1мин
403 Why do we need DNS?4мин
Domain Name System (DNS)
A global and highly distributed network service that resolves strings of letters into IP addresses for you
Domain Name
The term we use for something that resolved by DNS

404 The Many Steps of Name Resolution8мин
There are five primary types of DNS servers:
-1: Caching name servers 
-2: Recursive name servers  
-3: Root name servers  
-4: TLD name servers  
-5: Authoritative name servers



Caching and recursive name servers
Purpose is to store known domain name lookups for a certain amount of time

Recursive name servers
Perform full DNS resolution requests

Time to live (TTL)

A value, in seconds, that can be configured by the owner of a domain name for how long a name server is allowed to cache an entry before it should discard it and perform a full resolution again

Anycast
A technique that’s used to route traffic to different destinations depending on factors like location, congestion, or link health

405 DNS and UDP6мин
port 53
406 Sergio IT Great Field1мин

407 Resource Record Types8мин

408 Anatomy of a Domain Name3мин
Fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
When you combine all of these parts together, you have what’s known as this

DNS can technically support up to 127 levels of domain in total for a single fully qualified domain name.

409 DNS Zones4мин

DNS zones
Allow for easier control over multiple levels of a domain

Zone files
Simple configuration files that declare all resource records for a particular zone

Start of authority (SOA)
Declares the zone and the name of the name server that is authoritative for it

NS records
Indicate other name servers that might also be responsible for this zone

Reverse lookup zone files
These let DNS resolvers ask for an IP and get the FQDN associated with it returned

Pointer resource record (PTR)
Resolves an IP to a name



410 Overview of DHCP4мин
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
An application layer protocol that automates the configuration process of hosts on a network

Dynamic allocation
A range of IP addresses is set aside for client devices and one of these IPs is issued to these devices when they request
one

Automatic allocation
A range of IP addresses is set aside for assignment purposes

Fixed allocation
Requires a manually specified list of MAC address and their corresponding IPs

Network time protocol (NTP) servers
Used to keep all computers on a network synchronized in time

411 DHCP in Action5мин
DHCP discovery
The process by which a client configured to use DHCP attempts to get network configuration information

DHCPDISCOVER
Source:
0.0.0.0:68
Destination:
255.255.255.255:67

412 Basics of NAT4мин
Network Address Translation (NAT)
A technology that allows a gateway, usually a router or firewall, to rewrite the source IP of an outgoing IP datagram while retaining the original IP in order to rewrite it into the response

IP masquerading

One-to-many NAT

413 NAT and the Transport Layer4мин
Port preservation
A technique where the source port chosen by a client is the same port used by the router

Port forwarding
A technique where specific destination ports can be configured to always be delivered to specific nodes

414 NAT, Non-Routable Address Space and the Limits of IPv43мин
Regional internet registries

AFRINIC serves the continent of Africa.
ARIN serves the United States, Canada and parts of the Caribbean.

APNIC is responsible for most of Asia, Australia,

New Zealand and Pacific island nations.

LACNIC covers Central and South America and any parts of the Caribbean not covered by ARIN.

RIPE serves Europe, Russia, the Middle East and portions of central Asia.

The IANA assigned the last unallocated /8 network blocks to the various RIRs on February 3, 2011.
Then in April 2011, APNIC ran out of addresses.
RIPE was next, in September of 2012.
LACNIC ran out of addresses to assign in June 2014, and ARIN did the same in September 2015.
Only AFRINIC has some IPs left, but those predicted to be depleted by 2018.
RFC1918

415 Virtual Private Networks4мин
Virtual Private Networks (VPN)
A technology that allows for the extension of a private or local network to hosts that might not be on that local network

Two-factor authentication
A technique where more than just a username and password are required to authenticate

416 Proxy Services4мин
Proxy service
A server that acts on behalf of a client order to access another service

Anonymity 
Security  
Content filtering 
Increased performance 

Web proxies

Reverse proxy
A service that might appear to be a single server to external clients, but actually represents many servers living behind it

601 Week6 Troubleshooting and the Future of Networking
Congratulations, you've made it to the final week in the course! In the last week of this course, we'll explore the future of computer networking. We'll also cover the practical aspects of troubleshooting a network using popular operating systems. By the end of this module, you'll be able to detect and fix a lot of common network connectivity problems using tools available in Microsoft Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems.

Error-recovery
The ability for a protocol or program to attempt to fix it
Errors still pop up
Misconfigurations occur
Hardware breaks down
System incompatibilities come to

603 Ping: Internet Control Message Protocol5мин
The payload for an ICMP packet exists entirely so that the recipient of the message knows which of their transmissions caused the error being reported.

Ping lets you send a special type of ICMP message called an Echo Request.

If the destination is up and running and able to communicate on the network, it’ll send back an ICMP Echo Reply message type.

604 Traceroute2мин
Traceroute
A utility that lets you discover the path between two nodes, and gives you information about each hop along the way

607 Public DNS Servers3мин
An ISP almost always gives you access to a recursive name server as part of the service it provides.

Public DNS Servers
Name servers specifically set up anyone can use them, for free.

An organization responsible for assigning individual domain names to other organizations or individuals

609 Hosts Files3мин
The original way that numbered network addresses were correlated with words was through hosts files.

Hosts File
A flat file that contains, on each line, a network address followed by the host it can be referred to as

Loopback Address
A way of sending network traffic to yourself

Almost every hosts file in existence will, in the very least, contain a line that reads 127.0.0.1 localhost, most likely followed by ::1 localhost, where ::1 is the loopback address for IPv6.

Hosts files are a popular way for computer viruses to disrupt and redirect users’ traffic.
