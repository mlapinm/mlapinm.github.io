609 Intro to Soft Skills8m
In IT support, you work with users to fix technology and improve how people use it. To accomplish this, you need to develope a trust between you and the user.
Exhibiting empathy
Being conscious of your tone
Acknowledhing the person
Developing trust
The action you take by looking at it from their perspective is what ampathy is all about
Computer Problems?
Turn your computer off and on again, and it will start working.
Please try your computer off and back on again. This should update the change we made and fix the problem. If that doesn't work, just let me know.
Empathy and acknowledgement are a big part of building trust. Without these, you'll find it difficult to connect with the user.
Be honest with the user, even if you think they won't be happy about it.
610 Anatomy of an Interaction7m
How to say "Hello"
Just be professional, acknowledhe the user, and show them some respect.
Что не так.
Грустно слышать давай посмотрим что мы можем сделать.
Responding to user's question
Hi Rhori, how are you today?
What can I help you with?
Hi Rhori, I hope you're having a good day, despite your computer randomly turning off. Let's see what we can do to fix your issue.
To really build a rapport, try to remember a personal fact they've mentioned and bring it up later.
Just make sure you clarify the person's issue before you start to troubleshoot.
If you're supporting a user remotely and need them to run some commands, don't forget to tell them why you need them to execute the commands.
The last five minutes of the interaction will set the tone for how the user feels walking away from the interaction. So, make sure to end on a positive note.
611 How to Deal with Difficult Situations10m
Once you've identified this "reboot" action, write it down!
It's important to try and identify why this is happening.
Be patient!
