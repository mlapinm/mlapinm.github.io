"Only Time" Lyrics:

Who can say where the road goes
Where the day flows, only time
21.73542
And who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose, only time
33.492355
59.892049
Who can say why your heart sighs
As your love flies, only time
70.631011
And who can say why your heart cries
When your love lies, only time
82.297296
109.826584
Who can say when the roads meet
That love might be in your heart
120.188196
And who can say when the day sleeps
If the night keeps all your heart
131.626747
Night keeps all your heart
138.141781
163.345272
Who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose Only time
174.270312
And who can say where the road goes
Where the day flows, only time
185.734237
Who knows? Only time
198.589342
212.845134
212.845134

"Only Time" Lyrics:

Who can say where the road goes
Where the day flows, only time
And who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose, only time

Who can say why your heart sighs
As your love flies, only time
And who can say why your heart cries
When your love lies, only time

Who can say when the roads meet
That love might be in your heart
And who can say when the day sleeps
If the night keeps all your heart
Night keeps all your heart

Who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose
- Only time
And who can say where the road goes
Where the day flows, only time

Who knows? Only time
