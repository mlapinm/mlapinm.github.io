1
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:21,608
In sleep he sang to me

2
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,921
In dreams he came

3
00:02:25,635 --> 00:02:29,676
That voice which calls to me

4
00:02:29,677 --> 00:02:32,819
And speaks my name

5
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,299
And do I dream again

6
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:42,472
For now I find

7
00:02:42,643 --> 00:02:49,082
The Phantom of the Opera is here

8
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:54,416
Inside my mind

9
00:03:01,435 --> 00:03:05,148
Sing once again with me

10
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:09,401
Our strange duet

11
00:03:09,727 --> 00:03:13,168
My power over you

12
00:03:13,698 --> 00:03:17,182
Grows stronger yet

13
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:21,276
And though you turn from me

14
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:25,506
To glance behind

15
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:32,315
The Phantom of the Opera is there

16
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:37,887
Inside your mind

17
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:49,279
Those who have seen your face

18
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,223
  Draw back in fear

19
00:03:53,957 --> 00:03:57,527
I am the mask you wear

20
00:03:57,836 --> 00:04:00,960
It's me they hear

21
00:04:01,803 --> 00:04:10,440
My spirit and my voice in one combined 

22
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:17,277
The Phantom of the Opera is there

23
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:21,816
Inside your mind

24
00:04:37,651 --> 00:04:41,464
In all your fantasies

25
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:45,000
You always knew

26
00:04:45,968 --> 00:04:49,338
That man and mystery

27
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:53,078
Were both in you

28
00:04:54,073 --> 00:04:57,643
And in this labyrinth

29
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,493
Where night is blind

30
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:08,594
The Phantom of the Opera is there

31
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,469
Inside my mind

32
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:19,607
Sing, my angel

33
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:27,202
He's there the Phantom of The Opera

34
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:30,760
Aah

35
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:35,000
Sing my angel of music

36
00:05:35,223 --> 00:05:43,018
Aah

37
00:05:43,187 --> 00:05:45,772
Sing my angel

38
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:50,848
Aah

39
00:05:51,381 --> 00:05:52,480
Aah

40
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,196
Sing

41
00:05:54,196 --> 00:05:58,794
Aah

42
00:05:59,715 --> 00:06:03,171
Aah

43
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:05,000
Aah

44
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,267
Sing to me

45
00:06:11,698 --> 00:06:16,081
Aah
