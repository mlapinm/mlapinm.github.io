("Fernando")
28.34
Can you hear the drums, Fernando
I remember long ago another starry night like this
40.24
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself
And softly strumming your guitar
49.69
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
58.17
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
69.91
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life
And none of us prepared to die
79.09
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
87.26
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
95.9
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
103.57
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
111.09
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
119.85
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
142.7
Now we're old and gray, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
154.06
Can you hear the drums, Fernando
158.76
Do you still recall the frightful night
We crossed the Rio Grande
163.39
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land
171.38
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
179.94
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
187.71
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
195.04
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
203.73
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
212.25
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
219.88
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
227.37
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
235.67
Yes, if I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
244.38
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
247.27
