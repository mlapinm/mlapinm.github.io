 1.770155 welcome back to another Inkscape
tutorial 5.274046  in this video we're going to be
using Inkscape to do some more mapping 8.828583 
but this time we're not going to
actually get a vector map like we did in
the last video 12.274381  instead we're just gonna
grab some satellite imagery 16.418209  and
basically create something like this 19.824782  so
this is an example of one I've done I
just did like a screenshot 23.157503  and got this
imagery of this property  25.904718 and then I did
some you know puts a little tree line I
drew like some green circles here to
show trees I actually did some measuring
and so I know exactly like if I were to
build a 50 by 100 foot shop what the
footprint would look like on this
property 40.496581  so this is actually a 50 acre
property that I have here in Idaho 44.660716  and
this is sort of a mock-up of what I
wanted to look like so I wanted this is
a future building site for a house in
yellow  51.013663 and all of these are just
separate objects  53.780852 and so they're just
drawn right on top of the actual image
satellite image that I got from Google
in this case 62.984584  and so these are like some
different areas for animals to be this
is an existing house  69.136678 right here and this
is like an addition that I want to put
on to it and a little lean-to over here
or maybe you plant a tree here 75.436534  so it
just gives you a good idea these are
gonna be like some garden grow beds 81.105220  like
raised gardening beds 83.006940  this is my go-kart
race track like I said it's 50 acres has
a pond over here  90.282550 and some different
ponds that I'm gonna add in the future
and some nice treed area 94.942274  but so this
just helps me see exactly what I want to
do and then I actually have these
different things too like I have a 1
acre and this is how large 1 acre is  104.210300 so
if I could kind of overlay it 106.030497  and its
shaded a little bit 107.985558  so I could see how
much one acre like my I could see my
solar  112.150838 my solar array over here is gonna
be you know it'll be about a quarter or
a third acre maybe 121.638103  it's how much it will
take up I have a six acre pasture here
and I can I could change the color of
this to read or two green it just sort
of shades over 129.856795  and I can see still what
it will
you know I can see sort of the contour
of the the land underneath it  138.310570 if I want
to change like the pond like this I can
come over here and change the the size
of the pond and  144.461305 have it be a little bit
different so just really really cool
tools  147.674785 you know a lot of times people
think if this would be great for a
landscaping  152.199138 if you're like Ana landscape
architect  154.023172 or it's just good for it for
construction or for visualizing the use
of an area 160.592257  so in this one like I said
it's different than the last video  163.406685 we
did because it's not actually  165.454822 where we
can't actually edit like these existing
trees 169.408314  it's just an image  170.822483 so I'll show
you how to do this 172.361717  there's another
property  175.236485 that in Idaho that's very rural
here in Rockland Idaho  179.620217 middle of nowhere
so we're gonna zoom in here and I'll
show you how to grab this footage or
this footage know how to grab the the
actual image  186.447957 I'm getting this one from
open map tiles comm 189.740079  which is a much more
open I'm not quite sure I don't think
the satellite image you can actually use 193.976242 
I'm not sure I was reading on that but
they actually do offer free and open map
tiles  200.292840 that you can actually download and
you can host your own Maps  204.392164 privately and
just use them for whatever you want 207.136702  okay
here we go right here's the property I'm
looking at  210.890726 so this is a teeny tiny
little off-grid house  214.196122 that I'm also
working on and 216.944552  it's on 35 acres 218.592457 
this is ooh - see if we can get some
clarity on it  221.604433 looks like that's about as
clear as  224.320470 it's gonna give us
unfortunately so  225.565272 I'll zoom out a little
bit here 226.642511  but the property goes in fact
maybe I want to draw the property line 232.496615 
so what I'll do I'll just copy this part
of the image to do that there's some
browser plugins you can install that you
can actually make an area selection and
just select it  241.696910 but I'm gonna do the
Print Screen key  243.500251 so I'll just hit print
screen on Windows 246.810712  that'll save it to
your clipboard so you could open up a
program like or even like Microsoft
Paint  252.186101 and then you can right-click and
go paste in fact 255.242407  we might be able to
even do that here if we right-click and
go paste let's see 259.466802  no I don't think it
put it into our clipboard 261.376245  because I'm on
Linux here  262.911928 and so what I need to do
let's just go file new 264.880602 
and I'm actually going to it's for this
I'll find where that got saved to it I
think is my home directory  274.842792 it's this one
right here  276.944983 perfect so now we've got this
imagery I'll make this fullscreen 281.936206  and so
I actually have two monitors but this is
the one  285.239388 and I could bring it into to
and crop it  288.429682 but for now I can just
leave it just like this 290.521234  and now I can
actually come over and draw over top of
the building  294.469248 and make different notes on
here 298.743765  what is going on right click  299.981266 let's
go to fill and Stroke for my stroke size
down to something more manageable 305.501422  and
bring up opacity to 100% okay 312.457944  we've got
some very wacky colors going on here 318.434323 
let's just get rid of the stroke all
together by holding shift 323.738620  and clicking
on this X in the bottom left hand corner 325.926999 
and now we can that this is like really
really poor image  330.226928 also you can do the
same thing with a drone with drone
footage so you can download your own
drone footage  335.679253 and do it that way so
maybe I'll draw the house and I'll mark
it in red  340.250729 and then if I want to do the
border the property I can get the Bezier
curve tool 344.942598  and I just know this is
actually where my property line goes  349.130197 so
I'm gonna click  351.335194 it goes just about like
this this is the 35 acres  355.995288 does it I
don't know it goes up here yeah it does
oops it goes about to this little canyon
over here   367.893288 
now I might not go that far  371.298035 now close
this off and it creates a black line 375.234372  and
then I can click a Cutler so I'll do
maybe we'll do  379.594628 a let's do a blue and
then this one I can come over here to
our pasady under fill and Stroke and
turn it down up I have the image
selected right now 387.426295  I'll make sure that
the object is selected selected 390.309990  oh
that's a blend mode that's the opacity
of the image let's do this alright 396.994613  so
then I can just kind of see like that
now if I double click in here I can come
it in and round out some of these and
fix this one that I didn't want to have
like that  408.117898 yeah so there you go so I can
show someone this now 413.736109  I hold alt I can
access and click that  416.737591 let's raise this
to the top maybe was make it yellow  419.830019 and
so I could I could show this I could
send this part of the map to someone now
and say this is the the land and I could
put a note in here  428.085003 that says 35 acres
will turn it white  433.446006 so you can see it's
probably a really good tool for Realtors
or contractors or anyone that needs to
make notes on on top of existing imagery 442.965290 
it's a really really good way to go 444.577893  and
I could draw like an arrow  446.229950 you can do
arrows actually to let me show you that
so if we did this curve tool again we
just oops get the wrong tool 455.297873  if I go
like this and like this hit enter it's
just a black line 462.585693  and then we go into
fill and stroke and we can change it 467.122183 
over here so it has all inside of it
there   it's the ending so the marker 471.899304  put
an arrow on the other end  474.754315 so this will
have an arrow right on the end of it  478.274274 and
now we have a nice arrow pointing here 481.861515 
and we can hold down shift and make the
whole thing white  484.085696 if we double click we
can change the length of it 488.669835  so now I
have an arrow here pointing to the house 491.727303 
and I can say something about it as well 494.630679 
so I can just ctrl D duplicate this text
change the size of it a little bit 500.334012 
and I'll say something like 1200 square
foot house all right 513.707157  there you go
so I've successfully created some nice
information about this and if I wanted
to do we could do like a future location
of something like a pond  529.557570 or you know
future location of something 532.818203  but yeah
just a really great way that you can
quickly get in and add a vector layer
over top of an existing raster image
like this  542.325131 and then to export this what I
would do is sometimes I'll just come
over here and actually drop just a box
over the part I want to export 551.777857  and then
I turn down the opacity all the way down 556.690514 
and then I just go to file export PNG
image 560.950199  and I just export the selection I
make sure selection this is clicked
right here  565.402252 and then I just go we'll go
export as we'll send it to pictures 569.545710  and
we'll call it drop info dot PNG hit save 576.869603 
and now we hit the export button that
did that yeah and I could change the
size if I wanted to of that  583.845244 and now we
can come out a full screen here and we
can go and see what that looks like 588.877972 
right here so here's our property info
that we just did so this is just a
picture and it only show it's just this
part  598.904946 so we can email this to someone
it's not a very large file at all we
could upload it to the web and we have a
nice map layer over top 607.236774  this is
something you can also do pretty
reasonably using okay which is a
free author into Photoshop 614.004743  so hopefully
you found this video informative go
ahead and like comment subscribe let me
know if you have any questions  619.805016 and I'll
catch you in the next video 623.133998  623.133998  623.133998
