Now I've heard There was a secret chord 

19.77,
24.4 

That David played And it pleased the Lord 

24.4,
30.2 

But you don't really care For music, do you? 

33.27,
37.8

It goes like this The fourth, the fifth 

37.8,
42.03

The minor fall The major lift 

42.03,
47.67 

The baffled king Composing Hallelujah 

49.63,
73.3

Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 

73.3,
77.7

Your faith was strong But you needed proof 

77.7,
82.37 

You saw her bathing On the roof 

82.37,
88.5 

Her beauty and the moonlight Overthrew you 

90.57,
95.17 

She tied you To a kitchen chair 

95.17,
99.4

She broke your throne And she cut your hair 

99.4,
105.5 

And from your lips She drew the Hallelujah 

107.33,
129.87

Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 

129.87,
133.87 

Now maybe there's A God above 

133.87,
138.57 

As for me, all I ever Learned from love 

138.57,
147.13

Is how to shoot at someone Who outdrew you 

147.13,
151.0 

But it's not a crime You hear tonight 

151.0,
155.23

And it's not some pilgrim who Claims to have seen the light 

155.23,
162.13 

it's a cold and it's A very broken Hallelujah 

163.9,
207.27

Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 

207.27,
210.87

224.6,
242.73

Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 

242.73,
246.93 

Oh, people I've been here before 

246.93,
251.5 

I know this roo And I've walked this floor 

251.5,
257.4 

You see, I used to live alone Before I knew you 

259.83,
264.3 

And I've seen your flag On the marble arch 

264.3,
268.23 

But listen, love is not Some kind of victory march 

268.23,
275.17 

No, it's a cold and It's a very lonely Hallelujah 

276.67,
299.3

Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 

299.3,
303.7

There was a time You let me know 

303.7,
307.8 

What's really going on Below 

307.8,
313.5 

But now you never Show it to me, do you? 

316.33,
321.03

I remember when I moved in you 

321.03,
325.23

And the Holy Dove She was moving too 

325.23,
332.17 

And every single breath that We drew was Hallelujah 

332.77,
354.9

Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 

354.9,
359.4 

I've done my best I know it wasn't much 

359.4,
363.67 

I couldn't feel So I learned to touch 

363.67,
367.5 

I've told the truth I didn't Come here to London 

367.5,
369.43

Just to fool you 

369.43,
376.87

And even though It all went wrong 

376.87,
380.9

I'll stand right here Before the lord of song 

380.9,
384.13 

With nothing Nothing on my tongue 

384.13,
387.17

But hallelujah 

388.83,
428.33

Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 

428.33,

I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Now maybe there's a God above
As for me, all I ever learned from love
Is how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
But it's not a crime you  hear night
And it's not some pilgrime  who Claims to have seen the light
It's a cold and it's a very broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Oh, people I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
You see I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
But listen Love is not some kind of victory march
No, it's a cold and it's a very lonely Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Аккорд наполнил звуком зал,
Там Богу Царь Давид играл,
Но музыка тебя не интересует.
Бывает так четыре, пять,
Минор затих, мажор опять,
И Царь поёт вновь Богу Аллилуйя

Аллилуйя, Аллилуйя
Аллилуйя, Аллилуйя

Как вера ни была б крепка,
Вот доказательства греха,
Забыл закон, Вирсавией любуясь.
Она же твой разбила трон,
Остригла волосы потом,
И вырвала из уст то Аллилуйя

Аллилуйя, Аллилуйя
Аллилуйя, Аллилуйя

Конечно Бог и есть Любовь,
Но всем нам хочется порой
Тому, кто соблазнил, пустить в лоб пулю.
Не плач ты слышишь по ночам,
Когда влюблённые кричат,
Из плоти в небо рвётся Аллилуйя

Аллилуйя, Аллилуйя
Аллилуйя, Аллилуйя

А после через много лет
В знакомой комнате паркет,
Где жил до тебя один я не волнуясь.
Но твой флаг взметнулся надо мной,
Твой марш победный, не любовь,
Разбил на части в сердце Аллилуйя

Аллилуйя, Аллилуйя
Аллилуйя, Аллилуйя

Тогда ты говорила мне,
Что всё реально на земле,
Теперь молчишь, в догадках весь сижу я.
Едины были я и ты
Под кровом той блаженной тьмы,
Когда был каждый вздох как Аллилуйя

Аллилуйя, Аллилуйя
Аллилуйя, Аллилуйя

Не так уж много сделал я,
Душой желая лишь тебя,
Я правду говорил тебе святую.
Пусть в жизни всё пошло не так,
Пред Богом Песен, на устах
Одно лишь слово будет: Аллилуйя

Аллилуйя, Аллилуйя
Аллилуйя, Аллилуйя
Аллилуйя, Аллилуйя
Аллилуйя, Аллилуйя
