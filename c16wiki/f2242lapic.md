The geographical location of a country influences all aspects
of its people’s lives – their lifestyle, what kind of work they do
and what they enjoy doing in their free time, what places they
like visiting, what food they cook and eat and even what clothes
they wear, what they write about in their book and what legends
they create. It forms their traditions and customs – their culture.
The British people are great travellers. They travelled the

small, lovely, cosy, varied and extremely attractive. It is full of beauty.
Compare it with the world’s geography. The largest of the British
Isles – Great Britain – is about
230,000 sq km. The world’s largest island Greenland is
2,176,000 sq km. It means that Greenland is almost ten times
as large as Great Britain. The longest mountain range – the
Andes – is 9,000 km long. It is sixty times as long as the Cambrian Mountains in Wales, which are 150 km long.

The rivers in Britain are not very long
either. But of course they are not so short
as the Haolai  River in China and
they are not as narrow as this river. The
Haolai River is almost twenty times shorter than the Thames. The total (полная)
length of the Haolai River is about 17 km
and its average depth is about 50 centimetres. Usually, it is a bit more than 10 cm
wide. The narrowest part is only a few centimetres. You can put a book on it as a bridge. Therefore it is
also called the Book Bridge River. Experts are surprised that
this narrow river is like (как) any natural river. They also
proved (доказали) that the Haolai River has been flowing
(течет) for more than 10,000 years.
But none of the UK’s rivers can
compare with such a huge river as the
Amazon. It is almost (почти) as long
as the Nile. But the second longest
river in the world is the widest. Many
kilometers from its mouth the Amazon can be as wide as 11 kilometres.
During the wet season, parts of the
Amazon are more than 40 kilometres
in width. At the place where it meets the Atlantic, it is as wide
as 80 km. Because of its huge size, it is sometimes called the
River Sea. Nowhere is the Amazon crossed by brid ges. This
is not because of its huge width, but because most of the river
flows through tropical rainforest, where there are few roads and
even fewer cities, so there is no need for crossings.

Lesson 5. The custom of travelling
around the country
1a. Alesya, a girl from Belarus, has written to a forum to ask
about UK’s attractions, as it is customary for the people of Britain to
travel to the places of natural beauty in their country. Listen and
read the pages of the forum and match the forum visitors with the
places they write about.
A. Hi everybody! I’ve never been abroad, but this year I’m going
to school in the UK. What places could you advise me to visit?
James 007. The great thing about Great Britain is that
you can see here an amazing variety of nature, ranging from
fascinating mountains and grassy hills, picturesque valleys
and plains, purple moorlands and velvet grasslands to marvellous rivers and lakes, green forests and islands, and
of course, the big, great sea. There’s so much to see!
You have to be very selective (избирательным).
Cutey. I would recommend different parts of the UK. It should
be the Highlands in Scotland, the Giant’s Causeway1

in Wales and the Lake District in England.
Em. You’re absolutely right. I would strongly advise you to
go to the Lake District in the Cumbrian Mountains. I was there
last summer. It’s a National Park and one of the most popular
tourist attractions in England. Lake Windermere  is
an excellent place for boating. It’s the largest natural lake in
England – 16.9 km long, 1,609m wide and 67m deep. I’m sure
you’ll enjoy the valleys, lakes and mountains. The views are absolutely marvellous!
A. It sounds great! Thanks, folks .
James 007. By all means you ought to go to the Giant’s
Ca u se way in Northern Ireland. From the 1700s it became widely
known as the Eighth Natural Wonder of the World and visitors
began coming to the fascinating array  (массив) of over
40,000 basalt  columns  For centuries countless visitors have marvelled at the mystery of the Giant’s
Causeway. The amazing symmetry  of the columns has
always intrigued  the visitors. To walk on the Giant’s
Causeway is to voyage back in time.
Cutey. You have a wide choice now, A., but I would like to
advise you to go to Snowdonia in Wales. Nowhere else (нигде
ещё) in Britain will you find such a variety, in such a compact
area, as you will in Snowdonia in Wales. There are many places to
see and things to do in Snowdonia, so by all means go and enjoy
the mountains, beaches, moorlands, forests, lakes, valleys,
castles and steam (паровые) railways.
A. I’m already fascinated! Thank you, everybody.

“When people say England, they sometimes mean Great
Britain, sometimes the United Kingdom, sometimes the British Isles – but never England.”
2a. Listen and read the answers to Frequently
Asked Questions. Can you explain the quotation?
A. The UK is an abbreviation ()
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.
B. The UK is made up of four countries – England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. They are not independent
countries, but “countries in a country”. They share citizenship
(гражданство), the armed forces1, money, parliament and the
capital – London. Nevertheless, each of the countries has its
own national flag, emblem, anthem (гимн), and public holidays.
Remember! Only people from England are the English. People from Wales are the Welsh, people from Scotland are the
Scottish, people from Northern Ireland are the Irish. But
everybody from the UK is the British.
C. GB is an abbreviation for Great Britain. Great Britain
is a political term, which means three countries together –
England, Scotland and Wales. It is also a geographical term:
the largest island in the British Isles is called so.
D. Counties  (графства) are areas with their own
local government (местное правительство), which runs (руководит) education, housing, town planning, rubbish disposal

(утилизация мусора). County governments
look after roads, libraries, museums, sports
grounds, etc. Counties also give people a sense
(чувство) of homeland, its culture and history.
E. Yes, it’s true. The UK is a kingdom.
Queen Elizabeth II has been the head of state
since 1952. In fact (фактически), the country
is run by the government, which is made up of
ministers. The Prime Minister, who is the head of government,
is Boris Johnson (2019).
F. Everywhere (везде) in the UK English is the official and
common language. Nevertheless, each country of the UK has
its own language. In Wales there are two official languages –
English and Welsh. Welsh is studied at schools, and nearly
a fifth of the people in Wales speak it. Less than 2 per cent of
the people in Scotland, mainly in the Highlands and western islands, speak Gaelic . Only a few people can still speak
the Irish form of Gaelic in Northern Ireland.

Lesson 9. Loch Ness Monster
1. Look at the picture and speak about Loch Ness.
2. Have you ever heard of Loch Ness Monster? Listen, read
and answer: Is there enough evidence of its existence (свидетельств
его существования)?
P eople believe that in the deep waters of Scotland’s long lake, called Loch Ness (“loch” means “lake” in Scottish),
spreading almost from coast to coast in Glen More1, there is a
huge monster. It was seen first as long as 1,400 years ago.
Since that time thousands of people said they had seen the
monster. And all those who saw the creature, whether it was
in the 19th or 20th century, whether they were ordinary local
people or serious people like priests2, lawyers (юристы), policemen, teachers, describe the same thing: a huge, dark-coloured
creature, about seven to ten metres long with a long snake-like
head and neck.
There are very few photographs of the monster and there
are very few good ones. It’s understandable. Imagine you meet
such a creature. First you freeze open-mouthed, then you give
a cry of excitement, horror or great surprise. At last you remember that it’s a good idea to take a photo of the thing, but
the creature is hundreds of metres away and your hands are
shaking so much, that the photo can’t be good first thing.
Nevertheless, a group of scientists organised an Investigation Bureau3 in the 1960s. For a long time they watched with
cameras, listening equipment and sonar equipment4. The

loch [lk] = lake
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа32
equipment discovered animal-like
sounds and the film showed something alive. In fact, even (даже) with
lights it’s difficult to see a few metres
ahead, because the water in Loch Ness
is full of peat (торф) from the mountains around. So, it’s very dark. Later
some new sonar equipment found two
huge very strange moving objects (движущиеся объекты).
In August 1972 a team of experts picked up an echo and an underwater camera took a photo of something that looked like
a huge flipper (плавник). The experts explained that it looked
like a huge prehistoric creature – plesiosaur , which
had died out 70 million years before.
Loch Ness is 35 kilometres long and it’s very deep. The water is cold but never freezes (замерзает). So, it’s big enough
and good enough for a family of large creatures.
Could the myth be reality? Should we laugh at the discovery?
3. Read again and answer the questions.
1. When did people see the monster? 2. How many people
saw it? 3. How did they describe the monster? 4. Why are there
few photos of the monster? 5. When did scientists begin
to watch Loch Ness? 6. What equipment did they use? 7. Why is
it difficult to take underwater pictures in Loch Ness? 8. What
did experts discover in August 1972? 9. What creature was it?
10. Is Loch Ness monster a myth or reality?
Loch Ness Monster (irregular verbs pairing game)
Loch Ness Monster (regular or irregular verbs?)
4. Read the text below and advise Alesya to visit Loch Ness.
The Loch Ness Centre and Exhibition (выставка) is a 5-star
visitor attraction.
The famous Loch Ness monster mythology and scientific
information has been collected at the Centre. The activities
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа33
cover a wide range of school subjects, such as Environmental
Studies1, ICT2, Geography, History, Biology, English, Drama
and even Music. Children can also try real expedition equipment!
Any visitor can go Nessie-spotting (в поисках Несси) with
a guide on Deepscan Cruises. There are a lot of opportunities
for walks along picturesque trails (тропы). Cyclists can enjoy
fantastic views along the hilly routes. Tourists can go to castles, local villages, great gift shops and cafes.
The Loch Ness Centre and Exhibition is a must for British
and world tourists in the Highlands of Scotland.

2a. Listen and read about Harrow, the school where Winston
Churchill1 studied. Scan the text again. What makes the school
popular?
W hy did my parents choose Harrow? Because it’s an all- boys school with 805 pupils, and my parents believe
in the advantages of single-sex education for teenagers. It’s
also important for my family
that traditionally Harrovians
(this is how we call ourselves
here at Harrow), both bright and
average, achieve better examination results than pupils at any
other similar2 school. My parents also like that my school
aims at developing leadership3
and teamwork in its pupils.
Harrow is a full boarding school which means all boys and
all teachers live in the school. This helps the school to offer
a wide range of activities in the evenings and at weekends.
On Sundays, we usually have a great number of sports competitions. I play for my House football team. I also love playing
squash (it’s like tennis, but you play it in a four-walled court).
Do you know that the game of squash was invented in Harrow

2b. Listen and read about Eton. What are the advantages of
study ing there?
I study at Eton. It makes me feel proud that my school has educated
boys for nearly six centuries. Almost
all boys from our school then go on
to university.
Life at Eton is very busy and encourages interest and enthusiasm
both during and after classes. Of
course, here we do lots of sports,
such as hockey, tennis and athletics,
but the main sports at Eton are traditionally rugby and soccer (football).
We have a wide range of school clubs for after-school activities. They offer great opportunities to develop different talents and skills. In our free time, we read books, discuss them,
play music and learn languages. We also travel to foreign
countries, which helps us better understand ourselves and the
world.
We’re lucky to have such professional, experienced and enthusiastic1 teachers at Eton! They create a unique2 atmosphere3
of excellence and independence in which there’s no chance we,
pupils, don’t succeed.

B adminton School is a in the heart of the attractive University City of Bristol. boarding school for girls aged 4–18
The school offers excellent facilities, high teaching standards
and a friendly atmosphere, all
of which helps girls to achieve great
academic results.
What I especially like about
studying here is our library with
thousands of books, reference books
and multimedia computers, which
we use for our projects and selfstudy. Here we often do our homework, search for1 the information
on the Internet and relax reading a book.
Badminton aims at developing its pupils’ talents, skills and
abilities and helping them achieve success and everything they
want when they leave school. I’m sure that by the time I leave
school I will become an individual, comfortable in my own skin
and ready to be a part of the big world.

Lesson 9. St Peter‛s
1. Would you like to study at a boarding school? Why? Why not?
How do you imagine life there?
2a. Listen and read the story. Do you think the boys liked their
school?
1. In September 1925, when I was just nine, I started the
first great adventure of my life – a boarding school called
St Peter’s. We lived in South Wales then, but my parents had
chosen a school in England for me because they believed that
English schools were the best in the world, and St Peter’s was
the nearest boarding school to our home.
2. In the morning I put on my school uniform: black shoes,
grey and blue stockings, grey shorts, a grey shirt, a red tie, a grey
blazer and a grey cap with the school emblem on them. Everything I wore and my tuck-box were new and had my name on them.
a tie a blazer a tuck-box
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа62
3. No boy had ever gone to an English boarding school without a tuck-box where boys kept their tuck, food which their
mothers sent to them. All tuck-boxes usually had some homemade cake, a packet of biscuits, some oranges, an apple, a banana, a pot of strawberry jam and a bar of chocolate.
In a tuck-box there also were all kinds of treasures1 such
as a magnet, a pocket-knife and a compass, and I remember one
boy called Arkle who kept a pet frog there. Tuck-boxes were
boys’ own secret place, and no other boy, or even the Headmaster, had the right to open them.
4. St Peter’s stood on a hill above the town.
It was a long three-storied building, one-third
of which was for the Headmaster and his family.
The rest of the building housed about one hundred and fifty boys. At St Peter’s, the ground
floor was all classrooms. The first floor was dormitories (bedrooms), the Matron’s territory. She
knew everything that was going on there, and when we did
something wrong, she learnt about it immediately2 and sent
us downstairs to the Headmaster’s office where we were punished3 on the spot with the crack… crack… crack of a cane going
down our bodies.
5. Once, after the lights went out, a brave boy called Wragg
sprinkled4 some sugar all over the floor of the corridor. When
he returned, we were excited very much, and we lay in our beds
waiting for the Matron to walk along the corridor. Nothing
happened for a couple of minutes, but suddenly we heard
crunch… crunch… crunch and a loud shrieking, “Who did
this?” The Matron ran crunching along the corridor, opened all
the dormitory doors and switched on all the lights. “I want the
name of the naughty little boy who put down the sugar!” she
cried. “Be quiet,” we whispered to Wragg. “We won’t give you
away!” Then came up the Headmaster and also cried at us. Everybody kept quiet as we stood freezing barefoot in our pyjamas.
The Headmaster was getting very angry. “Very well,” he said at
last, “Everyone will give the keys to the Matron, and she will keep

them till the end of the term1. No one will get
anything from your tuck-boxes! And forget
about the food from your homes! We will teach
you a lesson!”
So, we had to give our keys away, and for six
weeks we went very very hungry. But during all
those weeks, Arkle continued to feed his frog through the hole
in his tuck-box. Using an old teapot, he also put some water in.
6. At St Peter’s Sunday morning was letter-writing time.
At nine o’clock everybody had to go to their desks and spend
one hour writing a letter home to their parents. Letter-writing
was a serious business at St Peter’s. It was like a lesson in spelling and punctuation2 because while we were writing our letters, the Headmaster was walking around the classroom looking over our shoulders to point out our mistakes.
But that, I am sure, was not the main reason3 for his interest. He was there to make sure we said nothing bad about his
school. So we could tell our parents what was really going
on there only on holidays, but we had usually forgotten about
a lot of things feeling happy to return home.

British meals
T he first meal of the day in the morning is British people eat toast with butter and jam (often breakfast. Some strawberry, raspberry, apricot) or marmalade (a type of jam made
from oranges) and nothing else. Others eat a bowl  of cereals , or muesli i with milk, or porridge. Melon,
grapefruit or fruit cocktail are popular.
A traditional English breakfast is a cooked meal which may
contain sausages, bacon, black pudding, scrambled or fried
egg, mushrooms, boiled tomatoes, beans, and toast.
A continental breakfast is a small uncooked meal: a bread roll
or croissant  with cheese or ham. The most common, usual
drinks at this time of day are orange juice or a cup of tea or coffee.
If a meal is eaten in the late morning instead of both breakfast and lunch, it is called brunch.
Lunch is the meal eaten in the middle of the day (usually between about 12.30 and 2.00). Many people eat meat, cheese or
other sandwiches. Some people have a simple meal, such as
cheese and biscuits, or soup and bread. Drinks at lunchtime are
very different: fruit juices, Coca-Cola, Fanta, Sprite, PepsiCola, Mirinda, 7up and others. Some people like tea or coffee.
The Sunday roast is a traditional meal eaten by a family
at Sunday lunchtime, for example, roast beef with roast potatoes, peas, Brussels sprouts, green beans, Yorkshire pudding
and gravy.
Supper is the most common name for the meal eaten in the
evening (usually between 7.00 and 8.30). Dinner is another
common name for supper. It is a cooked meal of meat or fish
and two veg  (vegetables), one of which is often potato.
It is common to eat dessert (also known as pudding ) after the main dish.

I am fine.
There are so many different interesting events here

You’ve asked me about the meals here. So, I’d better describe them in detail. We have ... breakfast at home, early

toast with marmalade or jam and a cup of tea. In British
schools, children can usually choose between ... hot or cold
lunch provided by the school or … packed lunch taken from
home. Some children get … free school lunch, but most children pay for theirs. Our … lunch break is from 12.15 noon
to 1.15 p.m. School … lunches are priced at £1.60. In the

I rish stew. stew from lamb Ireland’s best-known dish is a  or mutton. It is
simmered (варится на слабом огне) in hot
water with potatoes, onions, carrots, leeks
(лук-порей), and pearl  barley (пер -
ловая крупа). Potatoes have been a most
important food in Ireland since the 1800s.
French onion soup is made from onions and
beef or chicken stock (бульон). Thick slices of
bread with some cheese on top are toasted in
the oven and placed on top of each bowl of
soup.
Spaghetti Bolognese. This dish from Bologna  mixes spaghetti with a meat
and tomato sauce . Spaghetti is just one
form of pasta . Each region of Italy
has its own favourite types of pasta and its
own special sauces.
Greek salad is made with tomatoes, cucumbers, black olives, and cubes of feta  – a
white goats’ cheese. It is sprinkled with herbs
(посыпан травами) and olive oil.
Goulash is Hungary’s national dish. This stew is made
with meat, onions and potatoes. It is often
served with noodles (лапша) and slices of
black bread. Goulash is flavoured with paprika. Mushrooms, cabbage, or peas may be added, according to the choice of the cook.
Sushi is a favourite food in Japan. Slices of very fresh fish,
seafood and vegetables, wrapped in seaweed (завёрнутые
в водоросли) are laid on rice. The rice is flavoured with vinegar (уксус). Although the
ingredients  are simple, a good
chef  makes sushi beautiful to look at,
as well as good to eat.

lying about it.

meaning of the words in bold.
A. Cucumber sandwiches
C ucumber sandwiches are a summer need two slices of buttered white bread and thin slices must in Britain. You
of cucumber, nothing more. To be tasty they
have to be done really well. Cucumbers must
be peeled. Slice the cucumbers and salt them.
Leave them for ten minutes to let salt take
out some water from the cucumbers. Lay out
a few pieces of kitchen paper on the kitchen

table, place the cucumber slices on them, and pat dry with more
paper. If you want, you can sprinkle some lemon juice on cucumber slices. White bread has to be soft – the softer, the better. Neither mayonnaise nor margarine  can be used
instead (вместо) of butter. You don’t need to add more salt but
you can use white pepper to season your sandwiches. It adds
flavour (вкус).
B. Baked chicken sandwich
B aked chicken sandwich is a wonderful way to use up leftover cooked chicken.
You can eat these sandwiches cold, or wrap
 them in foil and bake. First, slice the
bread or cut buns into two halves .
Next, spread mayonnaise on one slice or one
half of each bun, and mustard on the other half. Then, slice or
chop (cut) chicken and put it on one slice of bread. Add ham,
a lot of your favourite cheese and thickly sliced tomatoes. After that, you can enjoy it but… there is a better option. Wrap
each sandwich tightly in foil. Preheat the oven to 180 °C and
put your sandwich into the oven for 15 minutes, until the
cheese melts. It tastes so much better!
After cooking, put the sandwich on a plate. Cut in half with
a knife. Serve it with a salad. It may be as simple as chopped
(cut) cabbage or lettuce and tomatoes or cucumbers as they add
freshness to the other ingredients.
4b. Tell each other how to make the sandwich you have read
about. What is surprising about sandwiches?
4c. Change your pair. Discuss why you would like or wouldn’t
like to make this sandwich.

Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа81
A. A slice of bread
A ll bread starts from a simple recipe: you mix flour and water and cook it.
Yet from this simple beginning come hundreds of different kinds of bread. There
are flatbreads from the Middle East and
Asia and small thin sticks from Italy and
southern Spain. The typical French loaf is long, thin, soft and
white inside; German bread is often dark and heavy. In many
countries – Britain and Israel, for example – you can find plaited loaves (плетёнки). Bread can be cooked in several ways: often it is baked in an oven, but chapattis  (from India)
and tortillas  (from South America) are fried. Bread
can also include things other than flour, for instance eggs,
onions, sausages, potatoes or fruit.
B. Croissants
W hen you think of the croissant you probably think of France, because the word sounds very French, but according to one story they were first made
in Hungary in 1686. The Turkish 
army was outside the walls of the city
of Budapest  Early one morning
the bakers (пекари) of Budapest were making bread when they heard some noise, as at
that time the Turks  were making a tunnel ()
through the city walls. They were sure that nobody could hear
them so early in the morning. The bakers woke the city up and
Budapest was saved. To celebrate the occasion, the bakers made
bread in the shape of the crescent () (полумесяц) moon
on the Turkish flag – and croissants are still eaten today, hundreds of years after the battle and thousands of miles from Budapest.

Dear Mum and Dad,
This weekend I spent with Natalie and her granny.
We wanted to learn to cook. Natalie’s granny was very kind
to let us use her kitchen and help us with useful advice.
Can you imagine?! We ourselves prepared and cooked
a three-course meal. It was great fun! There was only one
problem. Natalie’s granny worried a lot and kept saying: “Be
careful with the knives! Be careful not to cut yourselves!
You should remind (напоминать) yourselves to be careful.”
Nevertheless, Natalie made very good soup, all by herself.
I myself made pork chops and roast potatoes. Natalie’s granny helped us with the gravy and also made a beautiful
cake. She didn’t take a recipe from a cookery book. She invented it herself! I should remind myself to write down the
recipe for this cake before I go home. You will see how good it is.
Bye for now. Lots of love, Alesya

3. Do you have parties when all guests bring some food with
them?

2b. Listen, read Alesya’s letter to her parents and say what a
potluck party means. Check your guesses in ex. 2a.
Dear Mum and Dad,
We are going to have a potluck
party very soon. Potluck parties or
potluck dinners are very popular in
Great Britain. It is a time for people
to get together, enjoy meeting new
people or seeing old friends again.
Everyone is told to bring a dish. Here at school we would
like to cook as many national dishes as possible to show our
classmates what people eat in their home countries. As you
know, I am not the only foreign student here. There is also
a boy from Italy, a girl from China and a boy from America. Of course, we will have some traditional British dishes,
too. I would like to make draniki. Could you please send me
the recipe?
There are some rules for those who organise potluck
parties. All dishes should be prepared in advance. Nobody
should do more in the kitchen than put something in the
1 shepherd’s pie  – пастуший пирог
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа84
oven for reheating. The dishes
should be easy to transport. Everybody will take only a small portion
of each dish as there are many from
which to choose.
Natalie is going to make shepherd’s pie – a traditional English
dish. In England shepherd’s pie is traditionally made with
mutton. Americans usually make shepherd’s pie with
beef. The English (and Australians and New Zealanders)
call the beef dish a “cottage pie”. Whatever the name is,
you do it in the same way. You make several layers
of cooked minced meat and vegetables, with mashed potatoes on top, and bake it in the oven.
2c. Read the letter again and say if the sentences are true or false.
Explain why.
1. A potluck party is a party where people make food in pots.
2. For a potluck party everyone is asked to bring some dishes.
3. All dishes are cooked when people gather together. 4. You
can eat the whole dish if you wish. 5. Shepherd’s pie is traditionally made with mutton. 6. In America people call it a “cottage pie”. 7. Shepherd’s pie is several layers of cooked minced
meat and vegetables, with mashed potatoes on top.
2d. Discuss the difference between cottage and shepherd’s pie and
what other similar pies one can make.
3a. What ingredients do you use to make draniki?
3b. Listen to the telephone conversation and write down the
recipe for draniki.
3c. Discuss with your partner what you would like to have for
the potluck party.

Lesson 9. Harry Potter
1. Discuss the questions with your class.
1. Do you prefer reading books or watching films about
Harry Potter? 2. What do you like about Harry Potter? What
don’t you like?
2. If you haven’t read or watched the films about Harry Potter,
read the following before you read the text.
Harry Potter is a series  of seven fantasy novels
written by a British author J.K. Rowling. The books describe
the adventures of a young wizard Harry Potter, and his best
friends Ron Weasley   and Hermione Granger
, all of whom are students at Hogwarts
 School of Witchcraft  and Wizardry
. Harry has just arrived at Hogwarts, which is a boarding school, to start his education.
3a. Listen, read the text and say what meal Harry Potter had:
breakfast, lunch or dinner.
A lbus Dumbledore had got to his feet. He was smiling at the students, his arms opened wide, as if (как будто) nothing
could have pleased him more than to see them all there.
“Welcome!” he said. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts!
Before we begin our dinner, I would like to say a few words. And
here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you!”
He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered.
Harry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now
full of food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat
on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb
chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, chips, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup
and, for some strange reason, mint humbugs (мятные конфеты).
His aunt and uncle had never exactly kept him hungry, but
Harry had never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. His
cousin had always taken anything that Harry really wanted,
even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of
everything, except the humbugs, and began to eat. It was all
delicious.
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа88
When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food went from the plates, leaving them clean
as before. A moment later the puddings appeared. Blocks of ice
cream in every flavour you could think of, apple pies, treacle
tarts, chocolate йclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, jellies, and rice pudding.
At last, the puddings disappeared and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The Hall fell silent.
“Just a few more words now we are all fed and watered.
I have a few notices to give you.”
“First-years should note that the forest in the grounds
is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would
do well to remember that as well.”
“I have also been asked by Mr Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes
in the corridors.”
After the meal the boys were directed to their bedrooms.
Harry was going to ask Ron if he had had any of the treacle
tart, but went asleep almost at once.
(adapted from Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone by J.K. Rowling)

4a. Alesya’s father has a huge collection of coins and a big
library of books on the history of money. Listen and read the page
from one of his books and check your answers in ex. 3. Who’s the
winner in the game show?
W hy did people start using money? At first people tered, which means they exchanged things they had for barthings they needed. A farmer who had cattle wanted to have
salt, so cattle became a form of money.
Throughout their history people have
used different things as money: knives
and rice in China, cattle in Babylonia,
tobacco in America, whales’ teeth and
shells on the Pacific islands.
The first government to make coins
that looked alike and use them as money was probably the city of Lydia in
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа92
Ancient Greece. The coins were made
from a mixture of gold and silver. But
they were heavy and difficult to carry,
and the cities and the roads of Europe
were dangerous places to carry huge
purses with gold. In the early 1700s,
France’s government became the first
in Europe to make paper money –
banknotes or bills as they say in the US.
But paper money, as well as the first
coins ever, was invented in China,
where traveller Marco Polo saw it in the
1280s. Now people carry plastic credit
cards in their wallets instead of cash, which makes travelling
even safer and more convenient. With your credit card you can
take money from the cash machine at any time you need it.
When you go to a foreign country, one of the first things
you may see is what money looks like. Banknotes of different
countries show queens or presidents or other famous people.
But you also may find a tiger or elephant (India), cows and
fruit (Nigeria), a map (Norway), or even schoolchildren
(Taiwan).
Many countries in Europe
now have the same currency; all
their coins and paper money are
euros. Great Britain, however,
is still using pounds. People in
France and Italy miss their currencies – francs and lire. But
they agree that now money
travels easily from one country
to another. This makes it easier to make financial deals between
countries. And tourists can use the same kind of money to pay
for a slice of pizza whether it’s in Italy or in France. People
travelling to other countries usually need to convert (change)
their money into the local currency. For that an exchange rate
(курс обмена валют) is used.

to budget. Who is this programme for: children,
teenagers or adults?

spend, you plan your … (1).
A family … (2) shows all the money that comes into the family and all the ways that money will be spent, usually on things
like housing, school, clothes, food, cars and other things.
The government’s budget shows how much money it plans
to get and where it will spend that money – on such things
as education, roads, energy, etc. Sometimes governments too

spend more than they get. If you spend more money than you
get, you will have a “budget deficit”.
Make your own budget! Grown-ups are not the only ones
who have to worry about … (3). Children must become more …
(4) too. Say you’d like to buy a new video game, but you don’t
have any money saved. Make a budget to see if you can afford
to put a few pounds a week towards the new game. You may
be surprised to see how you spend your money.
Here’s how to make your own budget: write down every single thing you spend money on each week and how much it costs.
Your list may include cinema, CDs and food. Now add
up (сложите) how much you earn each week from pocket money, babysitting or a paper round.
Subtract (вычтите) the money you spend from the money
you earn. If there’s money left over – you are doing well.
If there’s no money left or you come up with a negative number, you have a budget deficit. In case you have a budget deficit, look at each item on your “spend” list to see if there’s anything that you can cut. … (5) your careless expenses and you
will be able to buy the things you really need.
Some of the rich are … (6) not because they have always had
a lot of money but because they have been budgeting and the
poor are … (7) because they haven’t.
the rich = rich people; the poor = poor people

following topics are the people discussing?
1. Pocket money 2. Saving money
3. Getting paid for chores 4. Earning money
 A Children should do some things for free, like cleaning their
own room. But they should get paid to do other chores like
babysitting. I think it’s fair. Barbara
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа103
When I was about fourteen, I started getting pocket money,
which was much more than my friends’ pocket money amounts.
But I had to buy my clothes and hair stuff and magazines and
records and so on. It was great because I felt rich at first, but
it also taught me to budget and to understand that I couldn’t
buy everything. Edward
 C Parents should pay their children to do housework. And
that should be the only money they get. That way they learn
to be responsible. John
  D I completely disagree!!! Paying children to do chores is a
mis take! They’ll start asking money for everything. Rupert
 E When I was 13–14, my Mum used to give me £5 a week for
doing work around the house like washing up, tidying my room,
doing the ironing, etc. I never used to spend it… and as the weeks
went on, the cash went up and up and up… and when I wanted
to buy a new game or a new top I was able to buy it. ☺ I still do those
chores every day now… I don’t get paid now though. / Fiona
 F I’ve been getting £25 a month since I was about 11 and a half.
Joe
 G I buy and sell stuff on the Internet so I make around £60–80
a week usually, sometimes more, sometimes less. I don’t spend
much, I’ve been saving my money for a year and I’ve saved a lot!
Well, the rich are getting richer, you know. Ricci
 H I think a fair amount is about £20 a month. If they want
more things, they’ll have to save or earn it. Brenda
 I My 13-year-old gets £10 a month; my younger two get £5
a month. This is just for saving or buying bigger things that
I won’t buy till birthdays or Christmas. I would love to give my eldest her pocket money but in our family every penny counts –
we hardly make ends meet. Having said that, she is a very responsible girl and she can budget. When she gets some cash, I know
she will spend it wisely. She’s starting a weekend job at Easter,
no paper rounds round here, so it’s only holiday work. Belinda

I’ve got my pocket money, so I can waste a couple of quid.
Let’s go and spend.
Alesya: What’s quid? Is it seafood?
Natalie: No, silly. It’s an informal word
for pounds – our British currency.
And what’s your currency – euro?
Alesya: No, it’s roubles – Belarusian roubles.
Natalie: I see. Where’s your purse?
Alesya: I don’t have a purse. It’s more
convenient to have a wallet for keeping banknotes, coins and credit cards. Look!
Natalie: Let’s barter! I (2. give) you £1, if you (3. give) me one
banknote with this beautiful building.
Alesya: But it’s not fair! It’s a huge amount of money.
Natalie: I see you (4. learn) quickly. Good for you! But why
do you carry all this Belarusian money with you? …
In the afternoon.
Alesya: I’d like to buy this book for my dad – it’s about old
coins. No, I can’t afford it. It’s too expensive. It costs
£25!!! OK, I’ll buy that one instead. I can get it almost for
free.
Natalie: Let me buy this book for you. I (5. save) to buy you

2b. Read the description below and compare with your ideas.
T he graph shows how Americans spend their money and how budgets change with the change of income1.
The visual demonstrates what money is spent on in three income categories – 1) the poor – people who just make ends meet,
2) people in the middle of the income range and 3) the rich.
Both the similarities and the differences are striking2.
1 income  – доход; 2 striking  – впечатляющий
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа108
Everyone spends a much larger part of their budget
on housing – getting somewhere to live. With all the three categories – the poor, middle class and rich families – the same
amount of money goes on clothing and shoes, and food outside
the home.
But the poor spend a much larger part of their budget on basic things such as food at home, utilities (electricity, gas, train
service, etc.) and health care. Rich people can afford to invest
a much bigger amount of money in education, and to spend
a very large part of their income on saving for retirement – the
period in their life when they have stopped working.
Do you also find the similarities and differences striking?
2c. Read the description again and find words that are used instead
of the following:
1) the graph, 3) money,
2) people, 4) spend money.
3. Answer the questions.
What do you think most of your family income is spent on?
Do you think it is a good idea to invest money in education?

money, about people who spend money, the amount of money
spent and the types of expenses.
Decide what tense should be used: past or present. Why?
5. Write your comments about the visuals. Before you write,
plan
a) the main ideas you would like to point out;
b) the number of paragraphs;
c) the words you will use to avoid repetition;
d) the tense: Present or Past Simple.
Lesson 8. Project: Debate
1. Choose a motion for your debate.
I. Children should get paid for the chores.
II. Teenagers should get a lot of pocket money.
2. Work in two groups. One should be opposing the motion; the

3. Vote in favour or against the motion.
The teacher chairs the debate. For the introduction the
teacher states the motion and introduces the teams. Speaker 1
opposes the motion. Speaker 2 proposes the motion. The chair
(teacher) invites the speakers to summarise their arguments
with one sentence each. Then Ss take a vote in favour and
against the motion. The chair announces the results.
Lesson 9. Alexander who used to be rich
last Sunday
1. Listen to the joke. Follow in the book. Is it funny? Explain
why.
She: You see, honey, this bag costs only fifty dollars. Good buy.
He: Yes, goodbye, fifty dollars.
2. When you were a little child, did you use to get

buys?
3. Read and listen to the story. Stop to
answer the questions in the boxes.
I t isn’t fair that my brother Anthony has two dollars and three quarters and one dime and seven nickels and eighteen
pennies. It isn’t fair that my brother Nicholas has one dollar
and two quarters and five nickels and thirteen pennies.
Question 1: A quarter is 25 cent, a dime is 10 cent,
a nickel – 5 cent. Who’s got more money: Anthony
or Nickolas?
It isn’t fair because what I’ve got is … bus tokens (жетоны
на aвтобус). And most of the time what I’ve mostly got is bus
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа111
tokens. And even when I’m very rich, I know that pretty soon
what I’ll have is … bus tokens. I know because I used to be rich,
Last Sunday.
Q. 2: Why is Alexander so unhappy?
Last Sunday Grandma Betty and Grandpa Louie came to visit from New Jersey. They brought salmon (лосось) because
my father likes to eat salmon. They brought plants because
my mother likes to grow plants. They brought a dollar for
me and a dollar for Nick and a dollar for Anthony because –
Mom says it isn’t nice to say this because – we like money.
A lot. Especially me.
My father told me to put the dollar away
to pay for the college. He was kidding (шутил). Anthony told me to use the dollar to go
downtown to a store to buy a new face. Anthony stinks (= he is extremely bad). Nicky
said to take the dollar and bury it in the garden and in a week a dollar tree would grow.
Ha, ha, ha. Mom said if I really want to buy
a walkie-talkie, save my money. Saving money is hard.
Information box: walkie-talkie – a small radio held in the
hand which is used for both sending and getting messages.
Because last Sunday, when I used to be rich, I went to Pearson’s Drug Store and got bubble gum. And even though I told
Q. 3: How did he get his dollar?
Q. 4: What did Alexander’s family recommend
him to do with his money? Were they serious?
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа112
my friend David I’d sell him all the
gum in my mouth for a nickel, he still
wouldn’t buy it. Goodbye, fifteen
cents. I absolutely was saving the rest
(остатки) of my money. I positively
was saving the rest of my money. Except that Eddie called me up and said
that he would rent (даст напрокат) me his snake for an hour.
I always wanted to rent his snake for an hour. Goodbye, twelve
cents.
Q. 5: What did he do with his money?
Anthony said when I’m ninety-nine
I still won’t have enough for a walkie-talkie.
My father said there are certain words a
boy can never say, no matter how bad his
brothers are being. My father
fined (ош тра фовал) me five
cents each for saying them. Goodbye, dime. Last
Sunday, when I used to be rich, by accident
I flushed (смыл) a dime down the toilet. A nickel
fell through a crack (щель) when I walked on my
hands. I tried to get my nickel out with a butter
knife and also my mother’s scissors. Goodbye, eight cents. And
the butter knife. And the scissors.
Q. 6: What happened to the scissors and the butter knife?
Last Sunday when I used to be rich,
I found this chocolate bar just sitting
there and I ate it. How was I to know that
it was Anthony’s? Goodbye, eleven cents.
Q. 7: Why did Alexander say “goodbye” to eleven cents?
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа113
I absolutely was saving the rest of my money. I positively
was saving my money. But then Nick did a magic trick and that
made my coins disappear. He didn’t know the trick to bring
them back. Goodbye, four cents.
Q. 8: Was Nickolas a good magician?
Anthony said that even when I’m 199,
I still won’t have enough for a walkie-talkie.
My father said that there are certain things
a boy can never kick (выкинуть), no matter
how bad his brothers are being. My father
made me pay five cents for kicking it. Goodbye, nickel. Last Sunday when I used to be
rich, Cathy around the corner had a garage
sale (распродажа). I positively only went
to look. I looked at a bear with one eye. I needed that bear.
Goodbye, twenty cents.
Q. 9: Would you buy a one-eyed bear at a garage sale?
I absolutely was saving the rest of my money. I positively
was saving the rest of money. I absolutely positively was saving the rest of my money. Except that I needed to get some
money to save. I looked in Pearson telephone’s booths for nickels and dimes that people sometimes forget. No one forgot.
I brought some non-returnable bottles down to Friendly’s Market. Friendly’s Market wasn’t very friendly. I told my Grandma and Grandpa to come back soon.
Q. 10: Can you guess why?
Last Sunday, when I used to be rich, I used to have a dollar.
I do not have a dollar any more. I’ve got this one-eyed bear.
And … some bus tokens.

in 1871 in the Bank Holidays Act, which was introduced by a
politician () Sir John Lubbock – a Liberal MP1.
A banker, scientist and social reformer, Sir John Lubbock
aimed to ease the life of the working class people when he suggested introducing days off, which were not religious holidays.
As banks were closed, all people had a day off. English people
were so thankful that they called the first Bank Holidays
“St Lubbock’s Days”.
After that, public holidays were renamed or added to the
calendar of different UK countries in different years from
1903 to the present time.
Very often the two words – bank holidays and public holidays – are used interchangeably2 in everyday life, although legally3 there is a difference. Strictly speaking, bank holidays
are holidays when banks and many other businesses are closed
for the day. Public holidays are holidays, which have been celebrated for many years through custom (обычай) and tradition.
In fact, whether holidays are bank or public, is written in the
Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971, which replaced the
Bank Holidays Act 1871.
If a public holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday, it is usually celebrated on the next working weekday, called “a substitute4 public holiday”. Extra bank holidays are created by Royal
proclamation5. For example, the wedding of Charles, Prince
of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer on 29 July 1981, the Golden
Jubilee of Elizabeth II on Monday, 3 June 2002 and the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton on 29 April
2011 were made extra bank holidays.

The history of this day goes back
centuries.
When Queen Elizabeth I (1533–
1603) took the throne of England in
1558, she made some laws against
the Roman Catholics (). Guy Fawkes was one
of a small group of Catholics who felt that the government was
unfair  to them. People hoped that King James I (from
1603) would change the laws, but he didn’t.
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа131
There were even fines (штрафы) for people who didn’t attend (go to) the Protestant church on Sunday or on holy days.
A group of men plotted to kill King James and blow up the
Houses of Parliament, the place where the laws were made.
a plot – to plot
The men bought a house next door to the parliament building. The house had a cellar (подвал) which went under the parliament building. The plotters planned to put gunpowder under
the house and blow up parliament and the king.
On the morning of 5th November 1605,
soldiers discovered Guy Fawkes with gunpowder in the cellar and arrested him.
He was questioned about the other
plotters. At first, he didn’t tell the soldiers anything about the plot, but later
he told the truth.
a question – to question
In celebration of his survival (), King James I ordered that the people of England should have a great bonfire on
the night of 5th November.
The event is still commemorated
 annually (every year) in England
on 5th November by burning “guys” (= effigies
) on bonfires. As well as burning an effigy of Guy Fawkes, the bonfires are used to bake
potatoes wrapped in foil1 and to warm up soup for
the crowds that come to watch the fireworks. The
traditional cake eaten on Bonfire Night is Parkin
Cake, a sticky cake containing a mix of oatmeal,
ginger, treacle, and syrup2. Other foods include sausages cooked
over the flames and marshmallows3 toasted in the fire.

On this night, people also enjoy fireworks display. Today
only adults can buy them, but in the past they were sold to children, too. So during the days before Bonfire Night, children
used to take their home-made guys out in the street and ask for
“a penny for the Guy” to collect money and buy fireworks.

of our talk today. Holidays and special days. In Britain,
holidays usually become traditional and we keep celebrating
them for years and years. Yet, some new holidays appear
in our calendar, some bank holidays are replaced with others. Is it the same in Belarus?
Alesya: Yes, sure. For example, Independence Day. Its history
goes back to 24 November 1996, when the republican referendum moved Independence Day to 3 July. I think it’s
a very important holiday. The day encourages people to remember that we achieved freedom of the country at the cost
of great loss in the past. The day is famous for the traditional military parade in Pobeditelei Avenue and a demonstration, which offer an opportunity to show that independent Belarus and its people have achieved great results and
success in different spheres  of life. It’s a very popular celebration, attracting crowds of people.

the answer. They put their halves together
and see if they have made up a whole heart.
3b. Listen and read the text about the history of St Valentine’s
Day and write questions and answers for the game “Matching
Hearts”.
V alentine’s Day is celebrated by millions of people all over the world. The celebration falls on the 14th of February.
On this day, people celebrate and show their love to each other
by giving gifts and cards and perhaps by having a romantic
dinner.
The history of Valentine’s Day – and its patron saint – has
a lot of mysteries. But we do know that February has long been
a month of romance. Customs which have a link with St Valentine’s Day started with the popular belief held by people in
Great Britain and France during the 14th and 15th centuries
that birds begin to mate on 14 February. Lovers, therefore,
found St Valentine’s Day the right time to send love letters and
gifts to the beloved.
But in recent time the festival is seen in a much larger perspective. Now, people take the opportunity of the day to wish
“Happy Valentine’s Day” to anyone they love – their father,
mother, teachers, siblings (brothers and sisters), friends, coworkers or anyone special to them. The idea is to give love and
spread happiness around us.
But, who was Saint Valentine? One legend says that Valentine was a priest who served during the third century in Rome.
When Emperor Claudius II decided that single men made better soldiers than those with wives and families, he outlawed
 marriage (поставил брак вне закона) for young men –
his soldiers. Valentine thought it was unfair and continued
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа142
to marry young lovers in secret. When Valentine’s actions were
discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to death.
There is a legend, that Valentine actually sent the first “valentine” greeting himself. Valentine fell in love with a young girl
who visited him in prison a few times before his death on 14 February. It’s no surprise that by the Middle Ages, Valentine had
become one of the most popular saints in England and France.
Other stories suggest (предполагают) that Valentine was
killed for attempting to help Christians escape Roman prisons
where they were often beaten. In Great Britain, Valentine’s
Day began to be popularly celebrated around the seventeenth
century. By the middle of the eighteenth century, it had become common for friends and lovers in all social () classes to exchange small gifts or handwritten notes. By the end of
the century, printed cards had begun to replace written letters.
Ready-made cards were an easy way for people to express their
emotions in a time when direct expression of one’s feelings was
discouraged. According to the Greeting Card Association, one
billion Valentine cards are sent each year, making Valentine’s
Day the second largest card-sending holiday of the year (2.6 billion cards are sent for Christmas).
4. Make your own Valentines in the shape of hearts.
Remember that the colours of St Valentine’s Day are red,
white and pink. Here are some ideas to help. Read the text
found on Valentines and write your own. It depends on who it is
addressed to – your friend, teacher, sister or brother, mother
or father, someone you love.
With you around sweetheart,
My life‛s a Song!
Happy Valentine ‘s Day to you!
A big warm hug
To wish you Happy Valentine’s
Day!

thoughts!
Please be my Valentine!

Lesson 1. Traditions on the British roads
1. Cars on the road unite all people. Most people of the world
are drivers. Are there any differences in driving in Belarus and
the UK?
2. Make questions about driving in Britain. Use the prompts.
1. What / like /drive / Britain? What is it like to drive in Britain?
2. petrol1 / expensive / Britain?
3. motorists / have to wear / front seat belts / the UK?
4. what / minimum driving age?
5. many roads / Britain?
6. roads / good / the UK?
7. what / the National Speed limit / the UK?
8. How / all speed limits / given on signs?
9. How / signs / indicate speed limits?
10. Why / drive on the left / in Britain?
3a. Listen, read and match the questions (ex. 2) with parts
of the text.
T he first thing you notice when you come to Britain is that they drive on the left-hand side of the road. Taking the
left-hand side on the road is a custom
or habit that goes back centuries
when people used to carry swords2,
most often in their right hand, to protect themselves. The custom was encouraged by the General Highways Act
of the British Government (1773),
1 petrol  – бензин; 2 sword  – меч
UNIT 6
VERY TRADITIONAL
BRITAIN
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа147
which advised horse riders, coachmen1 and people taking their
vegetables to market to drive on the left. The rule was made
a law by the Highway Act of 1835.
So, the second thing you notice is that the steering wheel is
on the right. However, the pedals are in the same position as in
left-handed cars, with the accelerator  – gas pedal –
on the right.
The gears and almost always the handbrake are both operated with the left hand. Less and less cars on the roads are with
a manual gearbox (с ручной коробкой передач). Most modern
cars are with an automatic gearbox.
Petrol  – 117p – and diesel () – 118p on average
(25 October 2015) are among the most expensive in the world.
The wearing of front seat belts was made mandatory (обязательное) for motorists in 1983.
The minimum age for driving a car in the UK is 17, and 16
for riding a moped or motorbike with a maximum engine capacity (мощность двигателя) of 50cc (cubic centimetres).
There are some 225,000 miles (362,000 km) of roads in Britain. Many of the roads are built on the old roads laid down
by the Romans centuries ago.
Roads in Britain range from wide modern motorways to narrow country lanes usually bordered by hedges, stone walls, grassy
banks of rivers or ditches (рвы). Cities and towns tend to have
compact streets because they go back to the times well before cars
appeared, and were certainly not planned for large lorries2.
The National Speed limits
On motorways and dual carriageways drivers can drive cars
at a speed of 70 mph (112 km/h)
Single carriageway roads: 60 mph (96 km/h)
Built up areas, e.g. towns and villages: 30 mph (48 km/h)
Residential areas: 20 mph (35 km/h)
Grammar focus: The article “a” in set expression
at a speed of
See “Grammar reference” on page 258.
1 coachman  – кучер; 2 lorry  = truck – грузовик
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа148
All speed limits and distances are given
on signs in miles or miles per hour. One mile
is about 1.6 km. Round signs indicate
(указывают) speed limits with the number
circled by a red band (полоса). When the
speed limit is no longer applied, then there
is a black line crossing through the number.
3b. Act out an interview with British teens about driving. Use the
questions in ex. 2 and the text.

4. Compare driving in Britain and in Belarus.
1. In Britain people drive on the left. In Belarus we drive
on the right.
2. The steering wheel is on the right in British cars.
3. The accelerator (gas pedal) is on the right.
4. The gears and almost always the handbrake (parking brake)
are operated with the left hand.
5. Most modern cars in Britain are automatic.
6. All motorists must wear front seat belts in Britain. The
minimum age for driving a car in the UK is 17, and 16 for
riding a moped or motorbike.

3a. Put the verbs in the correct tense forms to complete Tony

T ony Evans, head of the Olney pancake committee ex- plained: “First ‘Blue Peter’ promised (пообещали) they
(1. come) and (2. film) the children’s pancake races and (3. put)
it on the show. But then they rang and said the producer (4. do)
it. I was cross (=angry) as we (5. mention) they were coming

a strong letter to the producer. He said if they came they now
(6. have to) make a big thing of it and get the presenter to race
and it (7. be) in next week’s show.”
“It presented me with a dilemma – either I would have to let
everyone down and say ‘Blue Peter’ were not coming, or I would
have to break with tradition.”
“Over the last few years a lot of the girls have run to collect
money for charity and I thought that the BBC (8. give) the town

3c. Do you think Tony Evans was right? Discuss in groups. One
group is for and the other is against the decision.
3d. Report to the class. What’s the dominating opinion?
4a. A lot of people in Olney were angry about breaking the tradition
which had been around for centuries. Do you agree with them? This
is what they said.
“Letting a man in the race means that the traditional idea
has been forgotten and thrown away. Sadly the money interest
has become predominant,” said local resident Geoff Bacchus
.

Another resident Sally Harris, 48, added: “It’s a real shame

British fact file
E xchanging and eating eggs is a popu- lar custom in many countries, as
eggs are a symbol of spring and new life.
In the UK real eggs had been used before
they were replaced by chocolate eggs. The
eggs were hard-boiled and dyed in various
colours, which meant spring and light. There is an old traditional game played even today in the north of England, for example at Preston in Lancashire. Hard-boiled eggs are rolled
down hills to see whose egg rolls farthest.

A. When the sporting tradition began. B. Where and when
it is played. C. What the rules are.
Sporting traditions in the UK
1. Traditionally, forty-one days before Easter Sunday is a
special day for Christians, called Pancake Day or Shrove Tuesday. It is the day before Lent (Великий пост) starts. Lent is a
Christian fast (пост) which lasts forty days before Easter.
On Pancake Day people used to celebrate the last day before Easter when they could eat what they wanted. Eggs and milk ought
not to be eaten during Lent. That’s why the eggs, milk and butter left in the house were used for pancakes. All over England
there were pancake races on or near Shrove Tuesday. The tradition is still around today. The rules of pancake races are different in different places, but each participant, usually a woman,
has to wear an apron and a hat or scarf. They run with a pancake
in a frying pan and throw the pancake in the air. They have
to catch it again in the pan. The winner gets to the finishing line
first having thrown the pancake a pre-decided number of times.
The most famous pancake race takes place at Olney. The Olney pancake race is world famous.
2. The Highland Games is a Championship which began
in the middle of the 19th century in the Scottish Highlands.
Games are traditionally held in September. Today they include
highland dancing, contests in playing the bagpipes and one
of the most popular sports – “tossing the caber”. Tossing means
throwing. Players have to throw a long and extremely heavy
pine trunk (ствол сосны) as far as possible. The average caber
weighs  68 kilos and is usually about 6 metres long.
The heaviest caber in the history of caber tossing weighed 127 kilos. The player who throws his wooden caber the furthest
is not necessarily the winner. The style of throwing is more important than the distance. Players are usually very big and
strong!

3. St John’s Ambulance1 and first-aid volunteers2 are always present at the two-day football match held in Ashbourne
 in the Midlands every spring. The Ashbourne street
football game is one of many street football matches played out
all over the UK. The town is divided into two teams, depending
on where the players live. There can be hundreds of players
in each team and the two goal posts are nearly five kilometres
apart. The ball is not kicked but “hugged” close to the chest
(мяч «обнимают» = прижимают к груди). The shopkeepers in
the centre of town have to cover their windows with wooden
boards3 to protect them from the crowds (толпы) of players.
All locals, both the young and the old, enjoy this very lively
and sometimes violent4 game. The match ends with a few broken arms but people think it is all so much fun. They have been
playing this game every year for more than two centuries. It is
a bit difficult to get the ball from one end of town to the other
and sometimes no goals are scored.
3c. Tell each other about the sporting tradition you have chosen.
3d. In groups answer the questions.
1. Which sport is practised throughout the UK? 2. Which
sport is not usually played by men? 3. Which sport has an incredible number of players? 4. Which sport is the most dangerous? 5. Which sport requires the most physical strength?
6. Which sports involve throwing something?

2a. Listen and read the Good-manners guide prepared by

In England...
Do say “Excuse me”: if someone is blocking your way
and you would like them to move, say “excuse me” and they
will move out of your way.
Do say “Please” and “Thank you”: it is very good manners to say “Please” and “Thank you”. It is rude if you don’t.
You will notice in England that we say “thank you” a lot.
Do cover your mouth: when yawning or coughing1 always cover your mouth with your hand.
Do shake hands: when you are first introduced to someone, shake their right hand with your own right hand.
Do say “Sorry”: if you bump into someone, say “Sorry”.
They probably will too, even if it was your fault2! This is a
habit and can be seen as very amusing by an “outsider”.
Do smile: a smiling face is a welcoming face.
Do stand in line: in England we
like to form orderly queues (standing
in line) and wait for our turn e.g. getting on a bus. “Queue jumping” is not
welcome.

Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа166
Do take your hat off when you go indoors (men only):
it is impolite for men to wear hats indoors especially in
churches.
polite – impolite = not polite, rude
Nowadays, it is becoming more common to see men wearing hats indoors. However, this is still seen as being impolite, especially to the older generations.
Do drive on the left-hand side of the road.
Do open doors for other people:
men and women both open the door for
each other. It depends on (зависит от
того, …) who goes through the door
first.
Do not greet (не приветствуй) people with a kiss: we only kiss people who
are close friends and relatives.
Avoid (избегайте) talking loudly in public.
It is impolite to stare1 at anyone in public.
Do not ask a lady her age: it is impolite.
Do not pick your nose in public: use a handkerchief2
if you need.
Avoid backslapping (похлопывание по спине) and hugging (объятия): this is only done among close friends.

Lesson 9. The Last Cowboys
1. Travelling is one more custom followed by almost
everybody in the UK. Every summer millions of British people go to
other countries in search of good weather, beauty and new
experiences. Listen and read about the main characters of the book
“The Last Cowboys” by Harry Horse and answer: What’s real?
What’s fantasy?

R oo of the book, in Scotland. Roo wants to find her grandfa- is a dog, which lives with Harry Horse, the writer
ther. When he was a puppy he sailed
to America on a ship. He travelled all
over America and had a lot of different
jobs. Roo says her grandfather was a famous film actor and she showed him
to Harry in several films when they were
watching television. He looked like a different dog in each film but Roo said
that’s why he was an actor.
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа168
Of course, Harry finds some of the stories about Roo’s
grandfather hard to believe, but he wants to help Roo find her
grandfather in the Wild West.
They go to America together where they have a lot of adventures.
2. Listen and read the story, divide it into parts and match the
titles with the parts of the story.
The Last Cowboys
I t is not easy to find the Wild West any more, but the Get Lost Travel Agency1 were most helpful. They sold Harry two
tickets for a fourteen-day bus tour  to some of America’s
best attractions. They were going
to visit Hollywood (Roo’s grandfather could be there), the Grand
Canyon (Harry wanted to see this
very much), and a place called
Cowboy Town, which sounded
to Harry very much like the Wild
West.
Harry planned to travel light
this time, so he took the most important things for him – some
clothes, the tent and a few golf clubs (клюшки). But Roo didn’t
understand what travelling light meant. She wanted her ball,
her plastic rabbit, two bones, a drinking bowl, dog biscuits,
flea collar (ошейник от блох) (red), best collar (brown with
studs – со стразами), six tins of Mr Beefy Dog, a hairbrush,
a tin opener and fork, a bowl with “Roo” painted on one side,
a small chewed stick and a beanbag (she sleeps on this sometimes). Oh! How can a small dog have so many things!
Roo behaved badly on the plane. She didn’t want to sit still
in her seat and kept going to the toilet. She said she could hear
a mouse scratching there. She found an old lady’s glove and

chewed1 it to pieces. Harry had to apologise to the lady2 and
give her one of his gloves, though it was too big for her. Roo
barked all through the film, 101 Dalmatians and made a baby
cry licking its feet…
Harry was very happy when they finally landed.
When they got to the hotel, the manager said that dogs
can’t stay in a hotel. That’s why Harry had to pay more money
for a doggie bed in the room. It cost twenty dollars and Harry
was sure Roo would not sleep in it!
At midnight Roo ran all over the furniture and said that she
wanted to chase something. At last she fell asleep on top of the
TV. At three o’clock in the morning
she woke up and said she wanted her
dinner (she hadn’t got used to the
time difference3). When eating her
dinner she fell asleep and Harry put
her to the doggie bed. She looked so
good while she was sleeping.
When she got up, Harry was still sleeping. She walked on
the telephone and somehow called room service4. When Harry
woke up, the manager said that Roo had ordered (заказала)
eleven full English breakfasts. Harry had to pay for them
though it was an accident . So he was very angry
with Roo.
Anyway, their tour of America began and they went to a
film studio  in Hollywood to see how a film is made.
First they visited the pavement (тротуар) where all the famous stars leave their handprints. Roo walked on wet cement

and left her paw-prints in a space reserved for
Tom Cruise. Harry hoped Tom would not
be angry.
They wanted to leave the pavement but
at that moment a big gentleman with a large cigar shouted to them to stop. Harry was worried
that the man would attack them for the pawprints on the pavement, but he said he wanted
Roo’s “face”. Roo told him that her face was always on her body
and could not come off.
The gentleman explained that he was the biggest film producer in Hollywood and that he was going to make Roo a film
star. He wanted to film Roo in a commercial1 for dog food. All
Roo had to do was to eat a bowl of Crunchy Munchies and then
turn to the camera and smile. The film producer spent a long
time with Roo, explaining what he wanted her to do. Roo said
she would do it naturally. Then the director shouted “Action”
and the filming began. But as soon as the camera began working
things went wrong. Each time she took
some dog food in her mouth she made
an awful face and looked sick. It took
ninety-seven takes and afterwards Roo
was sick under the director’s desk.
“The biggest film producer” showed
them to the door and told Harry that
Roo’s career in films was finished.
After days of travelling they found
the Wild West and Roo’s grandfather.
(After Harry Horse)

musicians from ex. 3a. Who do you agree with?
Oksana: I can listen to Stary Olsa all day every day. They’re
awesome! They play medieval2 folk music, which is very original, expressive, and relaxing. The musicians play a wide range
of instruments such as the Belarusian bagpipe, lyre, gusli, svirel, Jew’s harp (варган), ocarina, Belarusian trumpet, birch
bark trumpet, hudok, tromba marina, and drums. They perform
at theatrical concerts and cultural festivals in Belarus and
abroad. Since 1999, they’ve recorded eleven albums. Stary Olsa
is popular in Belarus and in other countries. They’re successful
because they mix modern songs with old instruments and costumes, and because they use the Internet to show the world their
unique3 musical skills. I listen to Stary Olsa on the Internet, but
I’m dying to see their live performance at a folklore festival!
Rastislav: I like different styles of music, and my favourite
style is classical music. I’m a concertgoer4, and my favourite
concert hall in Minsk is the Belarusian State Philharmonic

which is in Yakub Kolas Square. I go to every concert of the
State Chamber Orchestra1, and every time their performance is
fantastic. The music that they play ranges from the 17th to the
21st centuries, and the orchestra plays it gorgeously. Many
outstanding2 Russian musicians have performed with the orchestra, such as Sviatoslav Richter, a pianist, Mstislav
Rostropovich, a cellist, Yuri Bashmet, a violinist, and others.
Nika: Do you have a favourite Christmas song? Mine is
White Christmas. It’s the most melodious and sentimental
Christmas song, I think. Do you know who wrote it? An American songwriter Irving Berlin! Do you know how he is connected
with our country? He was born in Belarus! His parents immigrated to the United States in 1893, when Irving was 5 years
old. Irving Berlin wrote a lot of songs that became a huge success. The style of his songs was popular (or pop) music. I listen
to his wonderful songs on the Internet. They are about 100 years
old, but they’re much-much better than many modern songs.
Stas: When one says, The Beatles, everyone thinks “The
UK”. When one says, Pesniary, everyone thinks “Belarus”. Pesniary was and is the musical symbol of our country. Pesniary
played traditional instruments for a band such as guitars, drums,
and a keyboard, but they also used a violin, an accordion, a flute
and a saxophone. The music that they played was a combination
of rock and folk, and pop and folk. Some songs – such as Kasiu
Jas Kaniushynu – are energetic, some songs – such as Alesya –
are melodious, but my favourite is Belovezhskaya Pushcha.
Every time I listen to it, I feel how much I love Belarus. Pesniary
were and are loved by Russian people, too. They sang some songs
in Russian, and they performed at concerts in Russia.

they became the most famous group in the world. Teenagers
and their parents, everyone seemed to get crazy about The Beatles music, their clothes, hairstyle, even the way they talked.
The musicians liked to experiment with the sound, and they recorded hundreds of great songs full of new kind of energy.
They recorded 13 studio albums of 211 songs. Some of the most
popular songs of the group were and still are Let it be, Yesterday, Yellow Submarine. After John Lennon was shot dead in a
street in New York in 1980, The Beatles couldn’t play together
again, but they are still one of the most popular groups among
people of all ages.

C. ALEXANDER RYBAK
T oday Alexander Rybak is one of the most popular solo per- formers in Europe. Alexander Rybak was born on 13th May
1986 in Minsk. When he was five, his family of three moved
from Belarus to Norway. His parents were both musicians, and
teaching their son to play the violin and the piano was the most
natural thing for them.
His success came to him after his amazing victory at Eurovision  in 2009 at the 54th Eurovision song contest in
Moscow, Russia. He finished the contest with a grand total of
387 points, breaking all records. Alexander sang Fairytale, the
song he wrote walking in the mountains on the Norwegian west
coast, the song inspired1 by Norwegian folk music. Fairytale
became a hit in Europe.
After his victory in Eurovision 2009, Alexander Rybak did
not end his connection with Eurovision. In 2014, the musician
composed Still Here for Franklin Halley, a Eurovision Song
Contestant from Malta. In 2015, Alexander prepared a Belarusian group “Milki” for the Belarusian Eurovision selection contest with a song called Accent. This composition came fourth in
the contest.
At the beginning of 2018, Alexander was chosen to represent Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest for the second
time. In the second semi-final on 10 May in Lisbon, Portugal,
Alexander Rybak was number one among eighteen participating countries. On 12 May 2018 Alexander Rybak came 15th
with the song That's How You Write a Song in the Eurovision
final.
Alexander’s life is filled with music – events, concerts,
projects, shows and performances. In 2015, the Norwegian musician took part in the One-to-One transformation show in Russia, where he won the second place.

magic, kindness and positivity.

lives in the catacombs  of the opera house and
loves Christine
phantom = fantфme (French) = ghost (English)
C hristine Daaй’s mother dies when the girl is very young. She and her father, a famous violinist, travel all over Sweden playing folk music. Her father is known to be the best wedding violinist in the land. During Christine’s childhood, her
father tells many stories, and a character known as the Angel
of Music figures a lot in all of them, especially3 in one about
a girl who can hear the Angel of Music. When Christine meets
Raoul, he also enjoys her father’s many stories.

Later, when Daaй’s father is dying, he tells Christine that
when he dies he will send the Angel of Music to her. Christine
cries for her father endlessly.
After several years of Christine’s hard work, she is given
a position in the chorus at the Paris Opera House. Very soon after she gets there, she begins hearing a voice which sings to her
and speaks to her. She believes it must be the Angel of Music,
and asks him if he is. The Voice agrees and offers to teach her
“a little bit of heaven’s music”. The Voice, however, belongs to
Erik, a deformed man, a genius1 designer2 who was one of the
people who built the Opera house. He secretly made a home for
himself in the catacombs deep down under the Opera house.
He is a real man, but he doesn’t let people see him and he makes
people believe that he is the Opera “ghost”. He’s been frightening the Opera management for many years and has been regularly getting money from them. When he meets Christine and
hears her wonderful voice, he falls in love with her, but
he doesn’t show himself to her.
With the help of the Voice, Christine sings beautifully at the
gala concert3 one night at the Opera. Her old childhood friend
Raoul hears her and remembers his love for her. After the gala,
the Voice, who reveals himself as Eric, comes to Christine and
takes her to live in his home in the catacombs. After two weeks,
when Christine asks him to let her go, he agrees, but only if she
wears his ring and is faithful to him. Christine, for a time,
can’t decide who is better for her: Erik or Raoul. After Christine tells Raoul of Erik, Raoul promises to take her away. They
plan to leave the next day, but as Christine feels sorry for Erik,
she decides to sing for Erik one last time. They don’t know that
Erik has been listening to their conversation.
The last night when Christine sings at the Opera house, Erik
kidnaps4 her during the performance. He begs her to marry him,
but she doesn’t agree. Then Erik offers her a choice: say no, and
he destroys5 the entire6 Opera house, or say yes and marry him.
Christine wants to say no, but soon she realises that Raoul,

together with a man from Erik’s past known as “the Persian”,
have come to rescue her and have, instead, found themselves in a
trap1. To save them and the people in the Opera house, Christine
agrees to marry Erik and kisses him. Erik, who has never before
in his life been kissed – not even by his own mother – is full of
emotion. He lets Christine go to marry Raoul. Erik and Christine cry together, and then she leaves. Three weeks later, a notice appears in a Paris newspaper saying that Erik is dead.

right to perform at his court , and it became known as “The
King’s Men”.
Shakespeare wrote 37 plays, including Hamlet, King Lear,
Othello, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, Much Ado about Nothing,
and many others. His plays made his theatre the most important company in the country. He also wrote poems and sonnets.
In 1610 he returned to his native town of Stratford-uponAvon. His life was much quieter there. He was very successful
and rich in his time. He had a big house and owned (владел)
a lot of land and he part-owned two theatres in London, where
his plays were regularly performed.
However, this historical figure is still surrounded by mystery. Some critics doubt1 whether he wrote the plays at all.
They argue that for a literary genius  his education
and life experiences were very limited (ограничены) – he was
not a widely travelled author.

But a recently published book by James Shapiro proves that
the plays are Shakespeare’s own, though many of his later
plays were co-written.
The fact is that Shakespeare’s plays are still popular today
and performed in lots of theatres round the world.
B. Arthur Conan Doyle 
was born on 22 May 1859 in Edinburgh,
Scotland, to a father of Irish origin, Charles
Altamont Doyle, and an Irish mother, Mary
Foley.
Conan Doyle was sent to the Roman Catholic Jesuit school, Stonyhurst, at the age
of nine and then continued at Stonyhurst
College.
From 1876 to 1881, he studied medicine at the University
of Edinburgh. In 1885 he became a doctor of medicine1.
Several times from 1891 to 1892 Conan Doyle tried to open
a medical practice, first in Plymouth , then in Portsmouth  and finally in London. Business was never very
successful and he had a lot of free time to discover a range of
other talents and interests. He joined football, bowling, political, literary and cricket clubs and began writing stories again.
His first story appeared in Edinburgh before he was twenty.
He was married twice – in 1885 and then in 1907 after his
first wife’s death, and had five children in these two marriages.
His first notable literary creation, called A Study in Scarlet, appeared in 1887. It introduced Sherlock Holmes and his
friend Dr. Watson () for the first time.
In 1892, the first out of five collections of Sherlock Holmes
stories was published. In 1893, the year of his father’s death,
Doyle decided to kill Sherlock Holmes and did so in December
that year. He wanted to be remembered for his historical novels
rather than his detective. But the government and public wanted to see Sherlock Holmes back to life, so a story about Sherlock Holmes’s secret mission for the government during a time
of war appeared in 1903. 1917 was the last year a Sherlock
Holmes story was published.

By 1920, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had become one of the
highest paid writers in the world. But after the death of his son
Kingsley, his brother Innes and other close relatives shortly
after World War One and his mother’s death in 1921 Doyle was
in deep depression. He found comfort in spiritualism, which
tried to find proof of life after death. On 7 July 1930, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle died from heart disease.
As an author, he wrote plays, verse, memoirs ,
short stories, historical novels (The Lost World), and supernatural fiction. But he will be mostly remembered as the creator
of one of the greatest literary detectives ever to live.
C. Joanne Rowling , author of the best-selling Harry Potter series of books, was born on 31 July 1965, the
same day as her famous boy-wizard hero.
The family, including her parents and
younger sister Di, lived near Bristol, in
south-west England. Her father worked on
airplane engines for Rolls Royce.
Joanne – called Jo by her family and
friends – did well at school, and was the top
girl in her class. Her favourite subjects
were English and foreign languages. After
finishing public school with top honours1
in English, French, and German, Rowling went on to study
French at the University of Exeter . She graduated from
the university in 1986 and over the next few years worked as a
secretary in different firms.
What she really wanted to do, however, was to write. Rowling wrote her first story, Rabbit, at the age of five or six. Later, she tried her hand at writing novels, but she had never finished writing any novel before she wrote the Harry Potter
books. It was during the difficult time when she came back
to Britain with a baby daughter after her unsuccessful marriage in Portugal.
Following its publication in Britain in June 1997, Harry
Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone quickly became a hit
with children and adults alike and won numerous awards2. The
Harry Potter series includes seven books – one book for every

year that Harry spends at Hogwarts. In 2000, the 35-year-old
author J.K. Rowling became the highest-earning woman
in Britain. She received an OBE (Order of the British Empire
), a medal awarded by the Queen, in March 2001.
At the end of that same year, she married her second husband,
and in 2003 and 2005 gave birth to a boy and a girl.
In 2008 she was named the 12th richest person in Britain.
Rowling’s books have been translated into more than 60 languages, and more than 300 million copies have been sold around
the world. The first four books have been made into films, and
all four are among the top twenty highest-grossing films of all
time. In February 2004, Forbes magazine named her as the first
person ever to become a billionaire  from writing books.
After finishing the Harry Potter series in 2007, J.K. Rowling went on to write a detective series under a pseudonym of
Robert Galbraith. The first book in the series, the Coocoo’s
Calling, was published in April 2013 as a debut novel and the
real name of the author was kept secret for some time. The other books in the series are The Silkworm, which was released in
June 2014, Career of Evil (October 2015), Lethal White (September 2018), and the fifth novel, Troubled Blood, published
in September 2020.
In 2020, Joanne Rowling returned to children’s books and
from 26 May to 10 July published online a new children’s story
called The Ickabog. Free access to the book was Joanne Rowling’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. A print edition of the
story was released on 10 November 2020, and a lot of the money from the book sale was donated to charity. On 13 April 2021,
it was announced that a new children’s book – The Christmas
Pig – would be released in October 2021.
D. Vladimir Korotkevich (26 November
1930 – 25 July 1984) is an extremely talented
Belarusian author who was born in 1930 in Orsha, Vitebsk region. In 1954 he graduated
from the Philological Department of Kiev University and taught first in a village school
in the Kiev region of Ukraine and then in his
home town, Orsha. Later, he completed a literature (1960) and then cinematography (1962)
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа215
course in Moscow. Literature became his main occupation. His
first published work was a poem which appeared in 1951, and
was later followed by three collections of verse. V. Korotkevich
also wrote a number of novels, including The Dark Castle Olshansky and The Wild Hunt of King Stakh («Дзікае паляванне
караля Стаха», 1964), as well as plays, essays, articles, screenplays for films, and some very interesting detective and adventure stories. He is a winner of several national literary awards.
This is how Andrei Khadanovich, a modern Belarusian poet,
describes his first experience of reading Korotkevich: “It was
1989. I was 16 years old. I unfolded the book by Uladzimir
Karatkevich with the first part of The Ears of Rye under Thy
Sickle («Каласы пад сярпом тваiм»). It was an unbelievable
experience. I lost track of time and came back to reality only
when I had finished the book. When you have opened the book
it’s difficult to close it. I was looking forward to reading its
continuation like today’s children look forward to reading another Harry Potter book.”
Korotkevich has a lot to offer. His literary works are full
of romanticism, rich imagination and emotions. They encourage love and respect to our motherland.

Jacqueline Wilson is a British best-selling children’s novelist. Only in the UK, her books sold more than 40 million copies.
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа216
Since her first published book in 1969,
she had written 112 of them by March
2021. Her books are about children and the
problems they face in their families, with
friends and at school.
Jacqueline Wilson has numerous
awards in literature. From 2002 to 2008,
she was the most borrowed author in British libraries. From 2005 to 2007, she was
the fourth Children’s Laureate – a position
given once every two years to writers and illustrators of children’s books for their great achievements (достижения) in this
field.
In 2017, Jacqueline Wilson was given a BAFTA1 Special
Award for her contribution to the development of children’s
television. A number of her books were adapted for television
series, e.g. The Story of Tracy Beaker (2002–2005), Best
Friends (2004), Tracy Beaker Returns (2010–2013), Hetty
Feather (2015–2020). In 2020 the first feature film2 Four Kids
and It, based on her book Four Children and IT (2012) was released. The book My Mum Tracy Beaker (2018) was adapted
for a television series with the same title in 2021.
In 2002, Jacqueline Wilson was appointed an OBE – Officer
of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire [empa] for
services to literacy in schools, and in 2008 she was appointed a
DBE – Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire.
It means that the title Dame should be used before her name.
Jacqueline Aitken was born on 17 December 1945 in Bath,
156 km west of London. Though her parents stayed together,
they were not happy, and Jacqueline herself did not feel happy
in her childhood either. She describes her mother as a person
who always thought she knew best and who never liked any of
her friends.
Jacqueline left school at the age of 16 and began training as a
secretary, but chose to work on a girl’s magazine Jackie instead3
for a Scottish publishing and television company DC Thomson.

Jacqueline married a policeman Millar Wilson at 19 in
1965, had a baby girl Emma at 21, but the marriage finally
broke up in 2004. By the way, when Emma was 9, she asked her
mum never to write about her in her books. And Jacqueline
does her best to keep the promise.
At the moment, Jacqueline Wilson lives happily in a large
country house in Sussex with beautiful opening views, a library and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, and a special room
where there is a collection of toys. And she keeps to her rule –
never to get up until she has written at least 500 words to follow her usual regime [] – two books a year.
On 18 March 2021, her latest book The Runaway Girls
was released. The book is about the events in Victorian London
of 1851.

Infographic “Reading

5. How do you see the future of books? Listen, read and say
which point of view you agree with and why.
T here are many factors to consider when discussing the matter of ebooks vs. printed books. Enthusiastic fans of
printed books say that there’s nothing like the smell of paper
and the rustle of the pages as the reader turns them gently with
their fingers. There is something fascinating about the experience of looking through the whole book and the possibility to
see the whole book.
On the other hand, those who prefer the ebook often say
that the device takes a lot of weight from their shoulders – literally. With the ebook, a reader can take hundreds of books
with them on a journey, to school or to work, which only take
up a few square centimetres in their bag.
There is one more important factor proving that printed
books are still a better choice. A study conducted by Sesame
Workshop1 found that children’s development is more effective
with a printed book rather than with an ebook. Reading a printed book offers a range of opportunities for parents to interact
with their children: grown-ups usually talk to children while
reading, helping them understand what is read and encouraging
them to use language to speak about the text. The research concluded that while ebooks also bring stories and encourage children to interact with add-ons, there is nothing to encourage the
child to use language. In fact, the added features can distract
(отвлечь) children from reading and understanding the story.
How will the fight of the digital era end? Will ebooks or
printed books come out on top?

Lesson 7. Take part in a book fair
1. What’s the best book you have ever read? What’s the best book
you have read recently? Which book would you like to recommend
to your friends and classmates?
2. One of the best ways to recommend a book is to write a book
review. Read how to write a book review and put its parts in a logical
order.
Model. 1 – B.
A. Body describes the main parts of a story: theme, plot,
setting, characters and your opinions about the book.
B. A book review describes, analyses and evaluates1. It includes an opinion and a recommendation and is addressed to a
future reader. It is usually made up of the following parts: introduction, body, and conclusion.
C. The theme is the main idea of the story. Write what you
think the theme is and how you know.
D. Introduction gives information about the title, author
and genre of the book. You could write what kind of story it is
(exciting / interesting / scary).
E. The setting is the time and place of the story. Think about
these questions: Is it set a long time ago or now? Does it take
place in another country or in an imaginary place? How much
time passes in the story – a day? a year? a lifetime?
F. The characters are who the story is about. The main character is called the protagonist. Who are the other important
characters? Do they help or hinder (мешают) the protagonist?
G. The plot is what happens. You ought to write what the
story is mostly about, but you ought not to retell the whole story in detail. What is the main event or conflict ? What
things lead up (ведут) to it? What happens as a result ?
You should avoid telling the ending, or giving away the secrets
of the story.
1 evaluate  – оценивать
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа222
H. Conclusion is just one or two most important things that
you want other people to know about the book.
I. Opinions give your thoughts and evaluation of the book.
Some questions you might want to answer are:
Did you like the story? Why or why not? What was the best
part of the book? Why?
How did the story make you feel? What new things did you
learn from this book? Who would you recommend it to?
3a. Listen and read the review of the book Best Friends
by Jacqueline Wilson and point out parts of this review.
B est Friends thor of more than a hundred works, including award-win- is a book by Jacqueline Wilson, who is the auning books The Suitcase Kid, The Lottie Project, Bad Girls,
The Story of Tracy Beaker, Vicky Angel and the Girls four-book
series.
Best Friends is about a little girl called Gemma. She’s a tomboy (a girl who takes part in activities and games that people
think are better for boys), always getting into trouble and annoying adults – but she’s actually a lovely, real, believable
child whom you can’t but like. Her best friend is Alice, though
they are completely the opposite. Alice is very girly with her
dolls, ballet classes and pretty party dresses.
They have been friends all their lives as they were born
in the same hospital on the same day. They have celebrated all
their birthdays together and have always been best friends,
hoping it will be so forever.
But then Alice’s father gets a new job and they have to move
house. The girls hate the idea of being separated, so they make
up a plan to run away together. But what happens then? You’ll
have to read the book yourself to learn it.
Best Friends examines the ending of one friendship and the
beginning of a new one. But the author does not only examine
the main characters. We also discover the relationships1 between children and their parents. Sometimes Gemma and Alice
believe their parents are being unkind, but they also understand how helpful, kind and loving they are. We can also see
1 relationships () – отношения
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа223
the relationships between children and
their grandparents. All of these are described in a realistic and believable way,
where love is placed at the top, which is a
great positive message for readers.
Overall, the book is really fascinating,
enjoyable and encouraging. The characters
are so realistic that you are transported
 into their world and become
part of it. It’s an excellent read.
Though it is more of a girly book than one for boys, everyone, including girls, boys and grown-ups, will find something
interesting for themselves. Once (= when) they start reading
it they will end up swallowing («проглатывая») a hundred pages at one sitting and only stopping because it’s late at night.
3b. Would you like to read the book? Why?
3c. Analyse the language of the book review. Which verb tenses are
used in each part of the review? Why?
NB: The Present Simple Tense is usually used for retelling
the plot of a book.
3d. Write the plan of a book review. From each part of the review
write out beautiful words, word combinations or sentences which
you can use in your own book review.
Lesson 8. Project “Book fair”
Get ready to take part in the class project “Book fair”.
You’ve made sure (убедились) that reading is fascinating.
In fact, we cannot live a day without reading. It opens numerous doors into the world and gives us a lot of moments of joy.
Reading is travelling in time, meeting amazing people, visiting
different countries, living different lives, exploring the Earth

1967, is one of Britain’s most beloved fictional characters, who first appeared in a
BBC Radio 4 play in 1982. Today Adrian
Mole is the central character and the narrator of one of the longest sagas in British
literature, including nine books, which
picture the British life from the 1980s
to the late 1990s. The books written in the form of a diary were
translated into 34 languages and were adopted for radio plays,
three TV series, a musical and theatrical plays, performed
in many countries.

When did it appear? Who invented it? What do you know
about the first films? How were the first films different from
the films of today?
3b. Listen, read the text and check your answers.
C inema was born at the end of the nineteenth century. It began with the invention of the camera. The first films
were short, sometimes only a few minutes. They
were shown in different places like clubs, shops,
and music halls. For the first thirty years
of their history, movies were silent . The
first sound films appeared in 1928. In fact, several people may be called the inventors of cinema, but the Frenchmen – the Lumiere 
brothers – were the first to present moving pictures to a group of paying people and that is why they are
called the fathers of modern cinema. Today’s cinema is full
of superb colour and fantastic sound and computer effects.

Speaker 1: In my opinion cinema is one of the most important and effective forms of art nowadays. It doesn’t only entertain1 us , but it also educates us and moves our feelings.
It takes us to another world, another reality.
Speaker 2: Cinema was really popular last century. Today is
the time of TV and the Internet. They take the biggest part of
our time and interests. Cinema is the art of yesterday.
Speaker 3: Cinema is international. It unites people of different nationalities and religions (). It helps to understand each other better.

Speaker 4: I’m fond of cinema because it’s always different, so everyone can find something for themselves. It was invented only a century ago but today it has become the most
popular entertainment all over the world.
Speaker 5: I’m a cinemagoer. Well… I like watching films
on TV, too. But TV films are different. They are usually for one
country. Films made for cinema shows soon become international. In this way cinema helps us to learn about different
countries, cultures and peoples.

Lesson 8. Project ″A review of
my favourite film”
1a. Read the fact file and answer the question: Who do you
think will like this film: children, teenagers, men, women?
Fact file: The film Braveheart about the
fight for Scots against the English in the late
13th century, directed by Mel Gibson, won
five Oscars at the 68th Academy Awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture,
Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best
Sound Editing (монтаж звука) and Best
Makeup.
1b. Listen, read the summary of the film and say who the
main characters are.
I n this spectacular, historic film a young Scotsman William Wallace (Mel Gibson) became a hero of his country, fighting
against the aggressive rule of the English King Edward I. After the death of his father and brother, killed by English soldiers, young William was raised (воспитывался) by his uncle
abroad.
Years later Wallace returned to his father’s farm with
an intention to lead a quiet life. He fell in love with Murron and
married her but their happiness didn’t last for long. Though
Wallace tried to rescue Murron from English soldiers, the aggressors caught her and killed her right in the marketplace.
He decided to pay back. Wallace and a few men from his village
killed the English soldiers and the sheriff and entered the fortress of the local English lord, killing him and burning the fortress down.
This action was like a signal for his countrymen. They saw
him as their leader to fight against the English King. In their
first battle in 1297 the Scots won. Wallace became popular and
more and more Scottish people followed him into the war.
But William Wallace was betrayed (был предан) by the
Scottish landlords, who tried to get more land for themselves
from the English King, and lost the battle in 1298. Though
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа248
he was saved from death by young Robert the Bruce, who later
became King of Scotland Robert I, Wallace had to go into hiding for seven years and fight a guerilla war (партизанская
война) against the English. His courage charmed a lot of people, including King Edward’s daughter-in-law (невестка) Princess Isabelle. At the end of the film the English caught Wallace
and took him to London where he was beheaded.
During the movie you see a lot of great battles and two
heartbreaking love stories (first between Wallace and Murron,
later in the film young princess Isabelle fell in love with Wallace). This film is a gripping story about love, hatred, patriotism and heroism. When you watch it, you understand why
it won five Oscars. You can watch this movie over and over
again and it never loses its magic. It is a movie which both men
and women will adore: men will love the great battles and women will enjoy the love story.

Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа250
2a. Listen, read about unusual cinemas in the world and
match the pictures with the texts.
A. The Archipelago Cinema, Thailand
I magine floating on a raft at sea in total darkness, with a jun- gle background and towering rocks on either side… Now
place a cinema screen into this dramatic landscape, and you
have the incredible1 Archipelago Cinema.
Designed by German-born, Beijing-based architect Ole
Scheeren, the Archipelago Cinema was created specifically for
the Film On The Rocks Yao Noi Festival in Thailand.
“When I saw the breathtaking beauty of the Nai Pi Lae lagoon, I thought it would be amazing if the audience would float
on the ocean while watching films,” Scheeren says. Inspired
by the local lobster fishermen’s rafts, Scheeren and his team
created a huge floatation device made from recycled wood and
mosquito nets. The audience sits on bean bags watching
an enormous screen that’s fixed to the ocean floor.
B. Event Cornwall Outdoor Screenings, UK
E vent Cornwall annually hosts outdoor screenings of water- themed films on the King Henry ferry2 as part of the Fal
River Festival. This year’s event started with the screening
of Jaws. “During that film, there was a fisherman’s boat that
circled the ferry with one light on, which added to the scary
1 incredible  – невероятный; 2 ferry – паром
1 2
3 4
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа251
atmosphere,” an Event Cornwall spokesperson said. “Likewise,
for a screening of The Perfect Storm, it poured with rain. It’s
like a 4D cinematic experience.”
Event Cornwall has also organised screenings of The Blair
Witch Project and Friday The 13th. For these films the location
was chosen in the wooded Tehidy Country Park. “There was
a moment in Friday The 13th where there was a chase1 through
the woods, and you couldn’t see where the screen stopped and
the woods started,” the spokesperson added.
C. CGV Cheongdam Cine City, Seoul, South Korea
T his cinema takes the viewing experience to the next level with moving seats, special lighting, wind, fog and even
scent2-based effects to make you feel immersed3 in the film.
For a screening of Titanic, the audience got to “go down with
the ship”, mist was created, and sea scented water was sprayed.
This 4D gripping experience aims to “free” the filmgoers by placing them into the shoes of the hero by feeling what he feels.
Sitting through amusement-park-type effects for such
a long time may not be suitable for everyone, so this cinema
is not a good choice for people with heart disease, back pains
and children under one metre.
D. Staircase Cinema, Auckland, New Zealand
T he Stairway Cinema was built in 2012 on an outdoor stair- case in a busy place with a lot of bus stops. This small, comfortable cinema is located on the steps of the staircase, used
as seats for about 7 people. Passers-by can step inside for a few
minutes and watch a short film while waiting for their bus
or laundry4.
Its creators said about their project: “Our aim is to experiment with architecture and the way it can interact5 with the
public in unique and exciting ways. This project takes inspiration from the site and its inhabitants. The intersection of Symonds Street and Mount Street is a place of ‘hard waiting’
with bus stops and laundromats, which make the staircase cinema a great spot for social interaction.”
1 chase – погоня; 2 scent – запах, аромат; 3 immersed – погружённый; 4 laundry  – стирка; постиранное бельё; 5 interact – взаимодействовать

2b. Read the texts again and say in which of the cinemas:
1) your seat can move,
2) you can watch a film to kill time while waiting for something,
3) you seat on steps,
4) some kind of interaction is encouraged,
5) your senses of smell and feeling are involved,
6) you might experience an adventure,

Grammar reference
UNIT 1
Lesson 4. Comparisons with as … as /
Сравнительные предложения с as … as
Помимо прилагательных в сравнительной и превосходной степени для сравнения предметов можно употреблять
пред ложения со сравнительной конструкцией as adjective
as, которая означает:
1) такой же как / не такой как:
+ Their house is as big as ours.
– Their garden is not as big as ours.
? Is your garden as big as theirs?
В отрицательных предложениях может употребляться
not so adjective as:
– Their garden is not so big as ours.
2) значительную разницу (в разы) между сравниваемыми
предметами, объектами:
Greenland is ten times as large as Great Britain. Greenland
is ten times larger than Great Britain.
Lesson 5. Modal verb ought (to) / Модальный
глагол ought (to)
Модальный глагол ought (to), как и should, выражает
совет, но более настойчивый. После ought употребляется
ин финитив с частицей to:
+ He ought to go there now.
– He ought not to go there now.
? Ought he to go there now?
В современном английском языке модальный глагол
should употребляется значительно чаще.
UNIT 2
Lesson 5. Modal verb need / Модальный глагол need
Модальный глагол need + Infinitive выражает необходимость совершить действия только в отрицательных
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа254
и вопро сительных предложениях, в то время как must + Infinitive употребляется только в утвердительных и вопросительных предложениях. В вопросительных предложениях
must и need являются синонимами, передавая значение
необходи мости:
Must I go there now? Need I go there now?
Отрицательная форма needn’t выражает отсутствие необходимости совершить действие, т.е. является противоположной по значению глаголу must, который выражает
запрещение:
You needn’t come early. – Тебе не нужно приходить рано.
You mustn’t come early. – Тебе нельзя приходить рано.
В утвердительном ответе на вопрос с глаголом need употребляется must, в отрицательном ответе на вопрос с глаголом must употребляется needn’t:
Need we do the whole exercise? – Yes, you must.
Must they come early? – No, they needn’t.
Чаще всего глагол need употребляется как смысловой
гла гол, а не как модальный. В этом случае он образует
времен ные формы так же, как другие смысловые глаголы:
+ I need to go now.
– I don’t need to go now.
? Do you need to go now?
Lesson 6. Infinitive or gerund / Употребление
инфинитива или герундия
Инфинитив представляет собой неличную глагольную
форму (неопределённая форма глагола), не имеющую ка тего рии лица и числа. В предложениях часто встречается после некоторых основных или модальных глаголов с частицей to или без неё.
Verb + to-infinitive: want to, need to, would like to, ask
smb to, tell smb to, advise smb to, recommend smb to.
Modal verb + to-infinitive: have to, ought to.
Modal verb + infinitive: can do, must do, may do, needn’t do.
Герундий – неличная глагольная форма, образуемая
с помощью -ing. Употребляется после некоторых глаголов:
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа255
like / love / dislike / hate / can’t stand doing smth; после
прилагательных с предлогами: be fond of / interested in /
afraid of / good at / bad at doing smth.
Lesson 6. Adjective + preposition /
Прилагательное + предлог
Прилагательные часто употребляются с предлогами,
например: about, at, by, for, from, in, of, to, with. Общего
правила употребления предлогов с прилагательными не
существует, поэтому надо запомнить предлог, с которым
употребляется прила гатель ное. (Смотрите список прилагательных с предлогами в электронном приложении.)
UNIT 3
Lesson 2. Articles / Артикли
Cуществительные, обозначающие прием пищи, не имеют ар тикля, если они употреблены в своём абстрактном значении, просто называют ту или иную трапезу и ассоциируются со временем приёма пищи: to have (take, serve, cook,
prepare) bre akfast, lunch, dinner, tea.
Lunch is at 12 o’clock. What shall I cook for dinner?
Неопределённый артикль употребляется, если у существительного есть описательное определение:
There is no such thing as a free lunch. A potluck dinner is a
dinner when everyone has to bring a dish.
Определённый артикль употребляется с данными существительными, если имеется в виду сама еда:
The dinner you cooked was great! How much did you pay for
the lunch?
Lesson 3. Quantifiers / Указатели количества
Для того чтобы посчитать неисчисляемые существитель ные,
употребляются слова, обозначающие меру объёма, и структура a ... of ... . Например, a glass of water.
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа256
A glass of ..., a bottle
of ..., a cup of ...
A slice of ..., a piece
of ..., a chunk of ...
A pound of (фунт =
454 грамма) ...,
a gram of ...,
a kilo of ...
water, milk, juice,
tea, coffee
cheese, meat, bread,
pie
cheese, meat, butter
flour, sugar, coffee
Lesson 6. Reflexive pronouns / Возвратные
местоимения
В английском языке нет возвратного местоимения
себя. Для обозначения перехода действия на само лицо
употребляются восемь возвратных местоимений, оканчиваю щихся на -self (-selves во множественном числе):
I – myself, you – yourself, he – himself, she – herself, it –
itself, we – ourselves, you – yourselves, they – themselves
На русский язык они переводятся глаголом с постфиксом
“-ся (-сь)” или местоимением “себя” (“себе”, “собой”, “сам”):
They talked about themselves. – Они говорили о себе.
I can take care of myself. – Я могу позаботиться о себе сам.
UNIT 4
Lesson 2. Present Perfect or Present Perfect Continuous
Present Perfect означает прошлое действие, завер шившееся к настоящему моменту, так что результат этого действия очевиден:
The teacher told us to read four books. I have already read
two (How many?). I have eaten half a bowl of soup (How
much?), but I can’t eat any more.
I / You / We / They have (not) V3
He / She / It has (not) V3
Рresent Perfect Continuous означает действие, начавшееся в прошлом и длящееся до настоящего момента:
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа257
A: What are you doing? – B: I’m cooking dinner. A: How
long have you been cooking? – B: I’ve been cooking for three
hours already.
I / You / We / They have (not) been Ving
He / She / It has (not) been Ving
Lesson 4. Определённый артикль
с субстантивированными прилагательными
Субстантивированные прилагательные выполняют роль
существительного. Как правило, они называют определённый класс людей и употребляются с определённым артиклем:
the blind (people who cannot see), the young, the old, the rich,
the poor. Например, The rich used to give presents to the poor
on 26th December. ‘The rich’ можно заменить словосочета нием
‘rich people’.
UNIT 5
Lesson 1. Past Simple Passive
Past Simple Passive употребляется, если настоящий исполнитель прошлого действия неизвестен или его не хотят
называть. Сравните: The Bank Holidays Act was introduced
in 1871. Подлежащее предложения The Bank Holidays Act
не выполняет действие, оно пассивно.
В Past Simple Passive используются те же указатели времени, что и в Past Simple Active: yesterday, … ago, last …,
in 1871.
+(–) I / He / She / It was (not) V3 …
We / You / They were (not) V3 …
? Was I / he / she / it V3 … ?
Were we / you / they V3 …?
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа258
UNIT 6
Lesson 1. The article a in set expressions / Артикль a
в устойчивых выражениях
Употребление артиклей в английском языке не всегда
подчиняется правилам. Есть ряд словосочетаний с неоп ределённым артиклем a, которые нужно запомнить, чтобы не
допускать ошибок:
a lot of (+ countable or uncountable noun in statements) –
много: We usually give and get a lot of presents at New Year.
My brother earns a lot of money.
a few (+ countable noun) – несколько: There are a few sandwiches in the fridge. You can eat them.

a great many (+ countable noun) – большое количество,
очень много: We’ve been friends for a great many years.
a (great / large) number of (+ countable noun) – ряд,
много: A large number of people have lost their jobs recently.
a little (+ uncountable noun) – немного: Have a little water

to have a good time – веселиться / хорошо проводить
время
to have a cold – быть простуженным
to have a look – посмотреть
to have a rest – отдохнуть
to take a seat – сесть
in a low / loud voice – тихо, громко
to tell a lie – лгать
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа259
Lesson 2. Past Perfect
Past Perfect употребляется для выражения про шедшего
действия, которое:
1) закончилось до другого дей ствия в прошлом:
At home she saw that somebody had eaten all her chocolates.
2) завершилось к определённому моменту в прошлом,
ука занному обстоятельством времени с предлогом by:
By four o’clock they had finished their preparation for the
party.
+(–) I / You / He / She / It / We / They had (not) V3 …
? Had I / you / he / she / it / we / they V3 …?
Future Simple-in-the-Past употребляется для выражения
будущего действия, рассматриваемого с позиций прош лого:
I think (Present Simple) I won’t win (Future Simple) because
that will be unfair to women. I thought (Past Simple) I wouldn’t
win (Future Simple-in-the-Past) because that would be unfair
to women.
Для образования Future Simple-in-the-Past необходимо
вспомогательный глагол will, используемый в Future Simple,
заменить на would.
+(–) I / You / He / She / It / We / They would (not) V …
? Would I / you / he / she / it / we / they V …?
Lesson 2. Object clauses / Придаточные
дополнительные предложения
Сложные предложения состоят из главного и придаточного предложений. Придаточные предложения могут
относиться к любому члену предложения: подлежащему,
сказуемому или дополнению.
Придаточные дополнительные предложения в составе
сложноподчинённого предложения выполняют функцию
дополнения – следуют за глаголом и отвечают на вопросы:
What? (Что?); About what? (О чём?):
I don’t know (don’t know what?) why they chose that house.
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа260
I understand (understand what?) whose idea it was.
Have you agreed (agreed about what?) on what we should do
next?
He explained (explained what?) when / how / with whom
we will go there.
She is not sure (not sure about what?) whether she wants to
take part in the contest or not.
Придаточные дополнительные предложения присоединяются к главному предложению с помощью следующих
союзов: that – что; what – что; who, whom – кто, кого / кому;
whose – чей / чья / чьё / чьи; whether, if – ли; what (book) –
какая (книга); which (book) – которая (книга); when – когда;
where – где; why – почему; how – как.
Союз that в предложении можно опустить:
She said that she could help me with homework. – She said
she could help me with homework.
Lesson 3. Sequence of Tenses / Согласование времён
Употребление времени глагола-сказуемого в придаточном дополнительном предложении зависит от времени глагола-сказуемого главного предложения. Данное правило называется правилом согласования времён в английском языке.
Если глагол главного предложения стоит в настоящем
или будущем времени, то глагол в придаточном предложении может стоять в любом времени в зависимости от смысла.
Если глагол в главном предложении стоит в прошедшем
времени, то глагол-сказуемое придаточного дополнительного
пред ложения может быть употреблён только в прошедшем
времени.
В придаточном предложении происходит сдвиг времён
в прошлое следующим образом:
Present Simple → Past Simple,
Present Continuous → Past Continuous,
Present Perfect → Past Perfect,
Past Simple → Past Perfect,
Future Simple → Future Simple-in-the-Past.
Изменяются также наречия времени и места и указательные местоимения:
now – then, last … – the … before,
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа261
today – that day, next … – the following …,
yesterday – the day before, here – there,
tomorrow – the next day, this – that,
… ago – … before, these – those.
UNIT 7
Lesson 2. Article with musical instruments / Артикль

UNIT 8
Lesson 2. Participle I (-ing) and Participle II (-ed) /
Действительное и страдательное причастия
Действительное и страдательное причастия образуются
от глагола с помощью суффиксов -ing и -ed. В предложении
они употребляются в функции определения. Действительные причастия выражают качества предмета или человека:
This is an interesting book. He is an interesting person.
Страдательные причастия выражают состояние человека
или предмета:
Hе is / looks / feels interested.
The book is illustrated.
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа262
Lesson 3. Relative pronouns / Относительные
местоимения
Относительные местоимения who (кто), whom (кого), whose
(чей), what (что, какой), which (который, какой, кто, что) связывают главные предложения с придаточными. В предложении они являются подлежащими или дополне ниями:
The man who (подлежащее) is sitting next to you is my
teacher.
It is not what (дополнение) I want.
Who употребляется по отношению к людям и является
в предложении подлежащим. Whom также употребляется
по отношению к людям, но является дополнением:
This is the man whom we saw in the park yesterday.
Which относится к неодушевлённым предметам и животным и может быть как подлежащим, так и дополнением:
The books which (подлежащее) are on the table are yours.
He showed me the photo of the kitten which (дополнение)
he had found in the street.
Если речь идёт о выборе среди нескольких людей или
предметов, употребляется местоименение which (выбор из
ограниченного числа возможных вариантов):
Which of the three writers do you prefer?
Which of the dishes is your favourite?
Иногда which относится не к одному слову, а к предложению в целом, которое отделяется запятой:
He offered to help, which is very kind of him.
Whose употребляется по отношению к людям:
This is the woman whose brother is a famous writer.
Whose, однако, может иногда относиться к неодушевлённым предметам, заменяя оборот of which:
We saw a mountain whose top (= the top of which) was
covered with forest.
