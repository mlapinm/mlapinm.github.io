and its average depth is about 50 centimetres. Usually, it is a bit more than 10 cm<br />
wide. The narrowest part is only a few centimetres. You can put a book on it as a bridge. Therefore it is<br />
also called the Book Bridge River. Experts are surprised that<br />
this narrow river is like (как) any natural river. They also<br />
proved (доказали) that the Haolai River has been flowing<br />
(течет) for more than 10,000 years.<br />
But none of the UK’s rivers can<br />
compare with such a huge river as the<br />
Amazon. It is almost (почти) as long<br />
as the Nile. But the second longest<br />
river in the world is the widest. Many<br />
kilometers from its mouth the Amazon can be as wide as 11 kilometres.<br />
During the wet season, parts of the<br />
Amazon are more than 40 kilometres<br />
in width. At the place where it meets the Atlantic, it is as wide<br />
as 80 km. Because of its huge size, it is sometimes called the<br />
River Sea. Nowhere is the Amazon crossed by brid ges. This<br />
is not because of its huge width, but because most of the river<br />
flows through tropical rainforest, where there are few roads and<br />
even fewer cities, so there is no need for crossings.<br />

Lesson 5. The custom of travelling<br />
around the country<br />
1a. Alesya, a girl from Belarus, has written to a forum to ask<br />
about UK’s attractions, as it is customary for the people of Britain to<br />
travel to the places of natural beauty in their country. Listen and<br />
read the pages of the forum and match the forum visitors with the<br />
places they write about.<br />
A. Hi everybody! I’ve never been abroad, but this year I’m going<br />
to school in the UK. What places could you advise me to visit?<br />
James 007. The great thing about Great Britain is that<br />
you can see here an amazing variety of nature, ranging from<br />
fascinating mountains and grassy hills, picturesque valleys<br />
and plains, purple moorlands and velvet grasslands to marvellous rivers and lakes, green forests and islands, and<br />
of course, the big, great sea. There’s so much to see!<br />
You have to be very selective (избирательным).<br />
Cutey. I would recommend different parts of the UK. It should<br />
be the Highlands in Scotland, the Giant’s Causeway1<br />

in Wales and the Lake District in England.<br />
Em. You’re absolutely right. I would strongly advise you to<br />
go to the Lake District in the Cumbrian Mountains. I was there<br />
last summer. It’s a National Park and one of the most popular<br />
tourist attractions in England. Lake Windermere  is<br />
an excellent place for boating. It’s the largest natural lake in<br />
England – 16.9 km long, 1,609m wide and 67m deep. I’m sure<br />
you’ll enjoy the valleys, lakes and mountains. The views are absolutely marvellous!<br />
A. It sounds great! Thanks, folks .<br />
James 007. By all means you ought to go to the Giant’s<br />
Ca u se way in Northern Ireland. From the 1700s it became widely<br />
known as the Eighth Natural Wonder of the World and visitors<br />
began coming to the fascinating array  (массив) of over<br />
40,000 basalt  columns  For centuries countless visitors have marvelled at the mystery of the Giant’s<br />
Causeway. The amazing symmetry  of the columns has<br />
always intrigued  the visitors. To walk on the Giant’s<br />
Causeway is to voyage back in time.<br />
Cutey. You have a wide choice now, A., but I would like to<br />
advise you to go to Snowdonia in Wales. Nowhere else (нигде<br />
ещё) in Britain will you find such a variety, in such a compact<br />
area, as you will in Snowdonia in Wales. There are many places to<br />
see and things to do in Snowdonia, so by all means go and enjoy<br />
the mountains, beaches, moorlands, forests, lakes, valleys,<br />
castles and steam (паровые) railways.<br />
A. I’m already fascinated! Thank you, everybody.<br />

Lesson 7. Frequently asked questions<br />
1. Can you explain the following quotation [kwəʊᶦteıᶴ(ə)n] from<br />
a book by George Mikes “How to be an Alien”?<br />
“When people say England, they sometimes mean Great<br />
Britain, sometimes the United Kingdom, sometimes the British Isles – but never England.”<br />
2a. Listen and read the answers to Frequently<br />
Asked Questions. Can you explain the quotation?<br />
A. The UK is an abbreviation ()<br />
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and<br />
Northern Ireland.<br />
B. The UK is made up of four countries – England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. They are not independent<br />
countries, but “countries in a country”. They share citizenship<br />
(гражданство), the armed forces1, money, parliament and the<br />
capital – London. Nevertheless, each of the countries has its<br />
own national flag, emblem, anthem (гимн), and public holidays.<br />
Remember! Only people from England are the English. People from Wales are the Welsh, people from Scotland are the<br />
Scottish, people from Northern Ireland are the Irish. But<br />
everybody from the UK is the British.<br />
C. GB is an abbreviation for Great Britain. Great Britain<br />
is a political term, which means three countries together –<br />
England, Scotland and Wales. It is also a geographical term:<br />
the largest island in the British Isles is called so.<br />
D. Counties  (графства) are areas with their own<br />
local government (местное правительство), which runs (руководит) education, housing, town planning, rubbish disposal<br />
1 the armed forces  – вооружённые силы<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа28<br />
(утилизация мусора). County governments<br />
look after roads, libraries, museums, sports<br />
grounds, etc. Counties also give people a sense<br />
(чувство) of homeland, its culture and history.<br />
E. Yes, it’s true. The UK is a kingdom.<br />
Queen Elizabeth II has been the head of state<br />
since 1952. In fact (фактически), the country<br />
is run by the government, which is made up of<br />
ministers. The Prime Minister, who is the head of government,<br />
is Boris Johnson (2019).<br />
F. Everywhere (везде) in the UK English is the official and<br />
common language. Nevertheless, each country of the UK has<br />
its own language. In Wales there are two official languages –<br />
English and Welsh. Welsh is studied at schools, and nearly<br />
a fifth of the people in Wales speak it. Less than 2 per cent of<br />
the people in Scotland, mainly in the Highlands and western islands, speak Gaelic . Only a few people can still speak<br />
the Irish form of Gaelic in Northern Ireland.<br />

Lesson 9. Loch Ness Monster<br />
1. Look at the picture and speak about Loch Ness.<br />
2. Have you ever heard of Loch Ness Monster? Listen, read<br />
and answer: Is there enough evidence of its existence (свидетельств<br />
его существования)?<br />
P eople believe that in the deep waters of Scotland’s long lake, called Loch Ness (“loch” means “lake” in Scottish),<br />
spreading almost from coast to coast in Glen More1, there is a<br />
huge monster. It was seen first as long as 1,400 years ago.<br />
Since that time thousands of people said they had seen the<br />
monster. And all those who saw the creature, whether it was<br />
in the 19th or 20th century, whether they were ordinary local<br />
people or serious people like priests2, lawyers (юристы), policemen, teachers, describe the same thing: a huge, dark-coloured<br />
creature, about seven to ten metres long with a long snake-like<br />
head and neck.<br />
There are very few photographs of the monster and there<br />
are very few good ones. It’s understandable. Imagine you meet<br />
such a creature. First you freeze open-mouthed, then you give<br />
a cry of excitement, horror or great surprise. At last you remember that it’s a good idea to take a photo of the thing, but<br />
the creature is hundreds of metres away and your hands are<br />
shaking so much, that the photo can’t be good first thing.<br />
Nevertheless, a group of scientists organised an Investigation Bureau3 in the 1960s. For a long time they watched with<br />
cameras, listening equipment and sonar equipment4. The<br />

loch [lk] = lake<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа32<br />
equipment discovered animal-like<br />
sounds and the film showed something alive. In fact, even (даже) with<br />
lights it’s difficult to see a few metres<br />
ahead, because the water in Loch Ness<br />
is full of peat (торф) from the mountains around. So, it’s very dark. Later<br />
some new sonar equipment found two<br />
huge very strange moving objects (движущиеся объекты).<br />
In August 1972 a team of experts picked up an echo and an underwater camera took a photo of something that looked like<br />
a huge flipper (плавник). The experts explained that it looked<br />
like a huge prehistoric creature – plesiosaur , which<br />
had died out 70 million years before.<br />
Loch Ness is 35 kilometres long and it’s very deep. The water is cold but never freezes (замерзает). So, it’s big enough<br />
and good enough for a family of large creatures.<br />
Could the myth be reality? Should we laugh at the discovery?<br />
3. Read again and answer the questions.<br />
1. When did people see the monster? 2. How many people<br />
saw it? 3. How did they describe the monster? 4. Why are there<br />
few photos of the monster? 5. When did scientists begin<br />
to watch Loch Ness? 6. What equipment did they use? 7. Why is<br />
it difficult to take underwater pictures in Loch Ness? 8. What<br />
did experts discover in August 1972? 9. What creature was it?<br />
10. Is Loch Ness monster a myth or reality?<br />

information has been collected at the Centre. The activities<br />

cover a wide range of school subjects, such as Environmental<br />
Studies1, ICT2, Geography, History, Biology, English, Drama<br />
and even Music. Children can also try real expedition equipment!<br />
Any visitor can go Nessie-spotting (в поисках Несси) with<br />
a guide on Deepscan Cruises. There are a lot of opportunities<br />
for walks along picturesque trails (тропы). Cyclists can enjoy<br />
fantastic views along the hilly routes. Tourists can go to castles, local villages, great gift shops and cafes.<br />
The Loch Ness Centre and Exhibition is a must for British<br />
and world tourists in the Highlands of Scotland.<br />

Lesson 8. Best-known British schools<br />
1. What famous schools do you know? Close your eyes and think<br />
of a British school. Write down the first five things you thought of.<br />
2a. Listen and read about Harrow, the school where Winston<br />
Churchill1 studied. Scan the text again. What makes the school<br />
popular?<br />
W hy did my parents choose Harrow? Because it’s an all- boys school with 805 pupils, and my parents believe<br />
in the advantages of single-sex education for teenagers. It’s<br />
also important for my family<br />
that traditionally Harrovians<br />
(this is how we call ourselves<br />
here at Harrow), both bright and<br />
average, achieve better examination results than pupils at any<br />
other similar2 school. My parents also like that my school<br />
aims at developing leadership3<br />
and teamwork in its pupils.<br />
Harrow is a full boarding school which means all boys and<br />
all teachers live in the school. This helps the school to offer<br />
a wide range of activities in the evenings and at weekends.<br />
On Sundays, we usually have a great number of sports competitions. I play for my House football team. I also love playing<br />
squash (it’s like tennis, but you play it in a four-walled court).<br />
Do you know that the game of squash was invented in Harrow<br />
around 1830?<br />
1Winston Churchill   – Уинстон Черчилль (британский государственный и политический деятель); 2 similar<br />
 – подобный, похожий; 3 leadership  – лидерство<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа59<br />
My school also offers brilliant facilities, such as a sports<br />
centre with all the equipment you need, an art gallery, one<br />
of the best school football pitches, a farm, a fantastic<br />
 school theatre and a modern IT centre. We study<br />
hard at Harrow, it’s true; but we also know how to use free<br />
time effectively and have fun! We take part in dozens<br />
of events which challenge our talents, abilities and skills and<br />
help to build our character.<br />
2b. Listen and read about Eton. What are the advantages of<br />
study ing there?<br />
I study at Eton. It makes me feel proud that my school has educated<br />
boys for nearly six centuries. Almost<br />
all boys from our school then go on<br />
to university.<br />
Life at Eton is very busy and encourages interest and enthusiasm<br />
both during and after classes. Of<br />
course, here we do lots of sports,<br />
such as hockey, tennis and athletics,<br />
but the main sports at Eton are traditionally rugby and soccer (football).<br />
We have a wide range of school clubs for after-school activities. They offer great opportunities to develop different talents and skills. In our free time, we read books, discuss them,<br />
play music and learn languages. We also travel to foreign<br />
countries, which helps us better understand ourselves and the<br />
world.<br />
We’re lucky to have such professional, experienced and enthusiastic1 teachers at Eton! They create a unique2 atmosphere3<br />
of excellence and independence in which there’s no chance we,<br />
pupils, don’t succeed.<br />
1 enthusiastic  – полный энтузиазма, увлечённый;<br />
2 unique  – уникальный, единственный в своём роде; 3 atmosphere  – атмосфера<br />
independent (adj) – independence (n)<br />

2c. Listen and read about Badminton School. How is the<br />
school different from the other two?<br />
B adminton School is a in the heart of the attractive University City of Bristol. boarding school for girls aged 4–18<br />
The school offers excellent facilities, high teaching standards<br />
and a friendly atmosphere, all<br />
of which helps girls to achieve great<br />
academic results.<br />
What I especially like about<br />
studying here is our library with<br />
thousands of books, reference books<br />
and multimedia computers, which<br />
we use for our projects and selfstudy. Here we often do our homework, search for1 the information<br />
on the Internet and relax reading a book.<br />
Badminton aims at developing its pupils’ talents, skills and<br />
abilities and helping them achieve success and everything they<br />
want when they leave school. I’m sure that by the time I leave<br />
school I will become an individual, comfortable in my own skin<br />
and ready to be a part of the big world.<br />
3a. Look through the three texts again and read the sentences that<br />
prove the high standards of education at these schools.<br />
3b. How are the schools different? What do they have in common?<br />
What do students do after classes at these schools?<br />
3c. Work in groups of three or four. Ask your groupmates which<br />
school they like the most and why. Don’t forget to be polite.<br />
4. What are the best-known schools in Belarus? In your city or town?<br />
What are they famous for?<br />
5. Do the project “My school”.<br />
1 Choose the form of your project: a booklet, a post for<br />
a website or blog, a multimedia presentation, an excursion<br />
for newcomers, a scrapbook2.<br />

Lesson 9. St Peter‛s<br />
1. Would you like to study at a boarding school? Why? Why not?<br />
How do you imagine life there?<br />
2a. Listen and read the story. Do you think the boys liked their<br />
school?<br />
1. In September 1925, when I was just nine, I started the<br />
first great adventure of my life – a boarding school called<br />
St Peter’s. We lived in South Wales then, but my parents had<br />
chosen a school in England for me because they believed that<br />
English schools were the best in the world, and St Peter’s was<br />
the nearest boarding school to our home.<br />
2. In the morning I put on my school uniform: black shoes,<br />
grey and blue stockings, grey shorts, a grey shirt, a red tie, a grey<br />
blazer and a grey cap with the school emblem on them. Everything I wore and my tuck-box were new and had my name on them.<br />
a tie a blazer a tuck-box<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа62<br />
3. No boy had ever gone to an English boarding school without a tuck-box where boys kept their tuck, food which their<br />
mothers sent to them. All tuck-boxes usually had some homemade cake, a packet of biscuits, some oranges, an apple, a banana, a pot of strawberry jam and a bar of chocolate.<br />
In a tuck-box there also were all kinds of treasures1 such<br />
as a magnet, a pocket-knife and a compass, and I remember one<br />
boy called Arkle who kept a pet frog there. Tuck-boxes were<br />
boys’ own secret place, and no other boy, or even the Headmaster, had the right to open them.<br />
4. St Peter’s stood on a hill above the town.<br />
It was a long three-storied building, one-third<br />
of which was for the Headmaster and his family.<br />
The rest of the building housed about one hundred and fifty boys. At St Peter’s, the ground<br />
floor was all classrooms. The first floor was dormitories (bedrooms), the Matron’s territory. She<br />
knew everything that was going on there, and when we did<br />
something wrong, she learnt about it immediately2 and sent<br />
us downstairs to the Headmaster’s office where we were punished3 on the spot with the crack… crack… crack of a cane going<br />
down our bodies.<br />
5. Once, after the lights went out, a brave boy called Wragg<br />
sprinkled4 some sugar all over the floor of the corridor. When<br />
he returned, we were excited very much, and we lay in our beds<br />
waiting for the Matron to walk along the corridor. Nothing<br />
happened for a couple of minutes, but suddenly we heard<br />
crunch… crunch… crunch and a loud shrieking, “Who did<br />
this?” The Matron ran crunching along the corridor, opened all<br />
the dormitory doors and switched on all the lights. “I want the<br />
name of the naughty little boy who put down the sugar!” she<br />
cried. “Be quiet,” we whispered to Wragg. “We won’t give you<br />
away!” Then came up the Headmaster and also cried at us. Everybody kept quiet as we stood freezing barefoot in our pyjamas.<br />
The Headmaster was getting very angry. “Very well,” he said at<br />
last, “Everyone will give the keys to the Matron, and she will keep<br />
1 treasure  – сокровище; 2 immediately  – тут же,<br />

them till the end of the term1. No one will get<br />
anything from your tuck-boxes! And forget<br />
about the food from your homes! We will teach<br />
you a lesson!”<br />
So, we had to give our keys away, and for six<br />
weeks we went very very hungry. But during all<br />
those weeks, Arkle continued to feed his frog through the hole<br />
in his tuck-box. Using an old teapot, he also put some water in.<br />
6. At St Peter’s Sunday morning was letter-writing time.<br />
At nine o’clock everybody had to go to their desks and spend<br />
one hour writing a letter home to their parents. Letter-writing<br />
was a serious business at St Peter’s. It was like a lesson in spelling and punctuation2 because while we were writing our letters, the Headmaster was walking around the classroom looking over our shoulders to point out our mistakes.<br />
But that, I am sure, was not the main reason3 for his interest. He was there to make sure we said nothing bad about his<br />
school. So we could tell our parents what was really going<br />
on there only on holidays, but we had usually forgotten about<br />
a lot of things feeling happy to return home.<br />
(Based on Roald Dahl’s autobiography “Boy: Tales of Childhood”)<br />

2c. Listen again and answer what Alesya would like to try.<br />
3a. Read the dialogue and match the names of the dishes in bold<br />
and their definitions below.<br />
A: The bell has gone. Let’s go to the canteen. I’m so hungry.<br />
I could eat a horse!<br />
N: Yeah, I’ll go with you but I don’t need to buy anything. I’ve<br />
brought a packed lunch but I’d love to have some tea and<br />
it’s so much nicer to have a meal with friends.<br />
A: Wonderful! I still need your help with some names of the<br />
dishes. What’s bangers and mash, for example?<br />
N: Bangers and mash is a nice and simple dish. It’s just a good<br />
plate of mashed potatoes (пюре) with a few sausages. It’s all<br />
covered in gravy.<br />
A: I hate gravy!<br />
N: So do I, but many people, here in Britain, love it.<br />
A: I love fish and chips. But I’ve had it twice this week already.<br />
N: I like fish fingers.<br />
A: I don’t. There’s more flour in them than fish. Is there anything on the menu you would recommend me to try?<br />
N: I’d recommend roast beef and Yorkshire pudding but it’s<br />
never served as school lunch.<br />
A: Pudding with meat? I’ve always thought puddings are sweet.<br />
N: Yeah, most often, but Yorkshire pudding is made from<br />
flour, eggs, and milk and traditionally served with roast<br />
beef. It’s yummy. I love it. There is also black pudding,<br />
very popular in Scotland. It is, in fact, not pudding at all.<br />

It’s blood sausage. OK, listen, have some roast chicken.<br />
It is usually very good here.<br />
Bob: Sorry for breaking in, but if I were you I’d have a pork<br />
chop with boiled potatoes and pickles1. I am having it now<br />
and actually always have them for lunch.<br />
A: Pork chops and pickles? How interesting! We often have<br />
them at home. It’s typically Belarusian. But no, thanks,<br />
maybe later. I’d like to try something new.<br />
3b. Act out the dialogue.<br />
4. Schools in Britain offer a variety of hot meals for lunch. Look<br />

British meals<br />
T he first meal of the day in the morning is British people eat toast with butter and jam (often breakfast. Some strawberry, raspberry, apricot) or marmalade (a type of jam made<br />
from oranges) and nothing else. Others eat a bowl  of cereals , or muesli i with milk, or porridge. Melon,<br />
grapefruit or fruit cocktail are popular.<br />
A traditional English breakfast is a cooked meal which may<br />
contain sausages, bacon, black pudding, scrambled or fried<br />
egg, mushrooms, boiled tomatoes, beans, and toast.<br />
A continental breakfast is a small uncooked meal: a bread roll<br />
or croissant  with cheese or ham. The most common, usual<br />
drinks at this time of day are orange juice or a cup of tea or coffee.<br />
If a meal is eaten in the late morning instead of both breakfast and lunch, it is called brunch.<br />
Lunch is the meal eaten in the middle of the day (usually between about 12.30 and 2.00). Many people eat meat, cheese or<br />
other sandwiches. Some people have a simple meal, such as<br />
cheese and biscuits, or soup and bread. Drinks at lunchtime are<br />
very different: fruit juices, Coca-Cola, Fanta, Sprite, PepsiCola, Mirinda, 7up and others. Some people like tea or coffee.<br />
The Sunday roast is a traditional meal eaten by a family<br />
at Sunday lunchtime, for example, roast beef with roast potatoes, peas, Brussels sprouts, green beans, Yorkshire pudding<br />
and gravy.<br />
Supper is the most common name for the meal eaten in the<br />
evening (usually between 7.00 and 8.30). Dinner is another<br />
common name for supper. It is a cooked meal of meat or fish<br />
and two veg  (vegetables), one of which is often potato.<br />
It is common to eat dessert (also known as pudding ) after the main dish.<br />

and dinner?<br />
3d. Discuss what British food is similar and what food is different<br />
to what we usually eat in Belarus. The lists you have just made will<br />

4b. Read the rule (page 255) and check your guesses.<br />
5. Read Alesya’s letter and fill in the articles where necessary.<br />
Dear Mum,<br />
I am fine.<br />
There are so many different interesting events here<br />
I would like to tell you about, but as always, I have very little<br />
time.<br />
You’ve asked me about the meals here. So, I’d better describe them in detail. We have ... breakfast at home, early<br />
in the morning. It is usually cornflakes with milk or porridge,<br />
toast with marmalade or jam and a cup of tea. In British<br />
schools, children can usually choose between ... hot or cold<br />
lunch provided by the school or … packed lunch taken from<br />
home. Some children get … free school lunch, but most children pay for theirs. Our … lunch break is from 12.15 noon<br />
to 1.15 p.m. School … lunches are priced at £1.60. In the<br />
evening we have … dinner which is very similar to what<br />
we have at this time of the day in Belarus.<br />
How are you and Dad? I miss you very much.<br />
Love, Alesya<br />

4b. The texts below describe the famous dishes from different<br />
countries. Listen, read the texts and check your guesses.<br />
I rish stew. stew from lamb Ireland’s best-known dish is a  or mutton. It is<br />
simmered (варится на слабом огне) in hot<br />
water with potatoes, onions, carrots, leeks<br />
(лук-порей), and pearl  barley (пер -<br />
ловая крупа). Potatoes have been a most<br />
important food in Ireland since the 1800s.<br />
French onion soup is made from onions and<br />
beef or chicken stock (бульон). Thick slices of<br />
bread with some cheese on top are toasted in<br />
the oven and placed on top of each bowl of<br />
soup.<br />
Spaghetti Bolognese. This dish from Bologna  mixes spaghetti with a meat<br />
and tomato sauce . Spaghetti is just one<br />
form of pasta . Each region of Italy<br />
has its own favourite types of pasta and its<br />
own special sauces.<br />
Greek salad is made with tomatoes, cucumbers, black olives, and cubes of feta  – a<br />
white goats’ cheese. It is sprinkled with herbs<br />
(посыпан травами) and olive oil.<br />
Goulash is Hungary’s national dish. This stew is made<br />
with meat, onions and potatoes. It is often<br />
served with noodles (лапша) and slices of<br />
black bread. Goulash is flavoured with paprika. Mushrooms, cabbage, or peas may be added, according to the choice of the cook.<br />
Sushi is a favourite food in Japan. Slices of very fresh fish,<br />
seafood and vegetables, wrapped in seaweed (завёрнутые<br />
в водоросли) are laid on rice. The rice is flavoured with vinegar (уксус). Although the<br />
ingredients  are simple, a good<br />
chef  makes sushi beautiful to look at,<br />
as well as good to eat.<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа74<br />
Borscht is a classic Russian or Ukrainian<br />
soup. There are many different recipes<br />
, but beet (свёкла) is its main ingredient. This dish is eaten cold in summer and<br />
hot in winter. Sometimes meat or mushrooms, cabbage, carrots and potatoes are added.<br />
Machanka is used as a Belarusian traditional sauce for draniki or blini. It may be different<br />
in different regions. Most often it is made with<br />
pork, sausage, sliced onion, sour cream (сметана) and flour.<br />

O n special occasions my aunt always makes her special apple pie. We have a large family, and my aunt makes it on<br />
a large baking sheet (противень). It is so delicious! We all look<br />
forward to getting a piece at the end of our meal.<br />
One day, the freshly baked pie was left on the kitchen table<br />
to cool as always. To everyone’s horror, the pie disappeared!<br />
We all knew that it was my cousin Dan and his friends who had<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа75<br />
taken it. They were teenagers at the time, and like all teenage<br />
boys, they ate a lot. Dan refused to admit (признаться) that<br />
he took the pie. My uncle was so angry that he sent Dan to his<br />
room, without dinner, for stealing (за кражу) the pie and then<br />
lying about it.<br />
Imagine my uncle’s surprise when, two days later, he found<br />
a chewed-up baking sheet in his dog Bobo’s doghouse! That day,<br />
my aunt made another apple pie just for Dan – and Dan got<br />
to decide with whom he would share it. My uncle and Bobo had<br />
to watch as the rest of us ate the apple pie.<br />
3b. Discuss why Dan didn’t treat his dad with a piece of apple<br />
pie.<br />

4a. Choose and read one of the following texts. Guess the<br />
meaning of the words in bold.<br />
A. Cucumber sandwiches<br />
C ucumber sandwiches are a summer need two slices of buttered white bread and thin slices must in Britain. You<br />
of cucumber, nothing more. To be tasty they<br />
have to be done really well. Cucumbers must<br />
be peeled. Slice the cucumbers and salt them.<br />
Leave them for ten minutes to let salt take<br />
out some water from the cucumbers. Lay out<br />
a few pieces of kitchen paper on the kitchen<br />
1mustard  – горчица; 2 mayo  = mayonnaise <br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа79<br />
table, place the cucumber slices on them, and pat dry with more<br />
paper. If you want, you can sprinkle some lemon juice on cucumber slices. White bread has to be soft – the softer, the better. Neither mayonnaise nor margarine  can be used<br />
instead (вместо) of butter. You don’t need to add more salt but<br />
you can use white pepper to season your sandwiches. It adds<br />
flavour (вкус).<br />
B. Baked chicken sandwich<br />
B aked chicken sandwich is a wonderful way to use up leftover cooked chicken.<br />
You can eat these sandwiches cold, or wrap<br />
 them in foil and bake. First, slice the<br />
bread or cut buns into two halves .<br />
Next, spread mayonnaise on one slice or one<br />
half of each bun, and mustard on the other half. Then, slice or<br />
chop (cut) chicken and put it on one slice of bread. Add ham,<br />
a lot of your favourite cheese and thickly sliced tomatoes. After that, you can enjoy it but… there is a better option. Wrap<br />
each sandwich tightly in foil. Preheat the oven to 180 °C and<br />
put your sandwich into the oven for 15 minutes, until the<br />
cheese melts. It tastes so much better!<br />
After cooking, put the sandwich on a plate. Cut in half with<br />
a knife. Serve it with a salad. It may be as simple as chopped<br />
(cut) cabbage or lettuce and tomatoes or cucumbers as they add<br />
freshness to the other ingredients.<br />
4b. Tell each other how to make the sandwich you have read<br />
about. What is surprising about sandwiches?<br />
4c. Change your pair. Discuss why you would like or wouldn’t<br />
like to make this sandwich.<br />
5. Use your imagination. Invent a new sandwich. Write down its<br />
recipe. Use the following words:<br />
slice, add, wash, put, preheat, bake, put, mix, peel, pat dry,<br />
butter, chop, season with, serve, wrap in foil.<br />

Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа81<br />
A. A slice of bread<br />
A ll bread starts from a simple recipe: you mix flour and water and cook it.<br />
Yet from this simple beginning come hundreds of different kinds of bread. There<br />
are flatbreads from the Middle East and<br />
Asia and small thin sticks from Italy and<br />
southern Spain. The typical French loaf is long, thin, soft and<br />
white inside; German bread is often dark and heavy. In many<br />
countries – Britain and Israel, for example – you can find plaited loaves (плетёнки). Bread can be cooked in several ways: often it is baked in an oven, but chapattis  (from India)<br />
and tortillas  (from South America) are fried. Bread<br />
can also include things other than flour, for instance eggs,<br />
onions, sausages, potatoes or fruit.<br />
B. Croissants<br />
W hen you think of the croissant you probably think of France, because the word sounds very French, but according to one story they were first made<br />
in Hungary in 1686. The Turkish <br />
army was outside the walls of the city<br />
of Budapest  Early one morning<br />
the bakers (пекари) of Budapest were making bread when they heard some noise, as at<br />
that time the Turks  were making a tunnel ()<br />
through the city walls. They were sure that nobody could hear<br />
them so early in the morning. The bakers woke the city up and<br />
Budapest was saved. To celebrate the occasion, the bakers made<br />
bread in the shape of the crescent () (полумесяц) moon<br />
on the Turkish flag – and croissants are still eaten today, hundreds of years after the battle and thousands of miles from Budapest.<br />

proud (гордится).<br />
4b. Read the letter again and guess what the words in bold mean.<br />
Dear Mum and Dad,<br />
This weekend I spent with Natalie and her granny.<br />
We wanted to learn to cook. Natalie’s granny was very kind<br />
to let us use her kitchen and help us with useful advice.<br />
Can you imagine?! We ourselves prepared and cooked<br />
a three-course meal. It was great fun! There was only one<br />
problem. Natalie’s granny worried a lot and kept saying: “Be<br />
careful with the knives! Be careful not to cut yourselves!<br />
You should remind (напоминать) yourselves to be careful.”<br />
Nevertheless, Natalie made very good soup, all by herself.<br />
I myself made pork chops and roast potatoes. Natalie’s granny helped us with the gravy and also made a beautiful<br />
cake. She didn’t take a recipe from a cookery book. She invented it herself! I should remind myself to write down the<br />
recipe for this cake before I go home. You will see how good it is.<br />
Bye for now. Lots of love, Alesya<br />

1. Do you have parties at home? 2. Who usually cooks?<br />
3. Do you have parties when all guests bring some food with<br />
them?<br />
2a. Match the words and their definitions.<br />
1. shepherd’s pie1, 2. cottage pie, 3. draniki, 4. kolduny<br />
A. potato pancakes, B. a traditional British pie with mutton, C. a traditional British pie with beef, D. potato pancakes with meat<br />
2b. Listen, read Alesya’s letter to her parents and say what a<br />
potluck party means. Check your guesses in ex. 2a.<br />
Dear Mum and Dad,<br />
We are going to have a potluck<br />
party very soon. Potluck parties or<br />
potluck dinners are very popular in<br />
Great Britain. It is a time for people<br />
to get together, enjoy meeting new<br />
people or seeing old friends again.<br />
Everyone is told to bring a dish. Here at school we would<br />
like to cook as many national dishes as possible to show our<br />
classmates what people eat in their home countries. As you<br />
know, I am not the only foreign student here. There is also<br />
a boy from Italy, a girl from China and a boy from America. Of course, we will have some traditional British dishes,<br />
too. I would like to make draniki. Could you please send me<br />
the recipe?<br />
There are some rules for those who organise potluck<br />
parties. All dishes should be prepared in advance. Nobody<br />
should do more in the kitchen than put something in the<br />
1 shepherd’s pie  – пастуший пирог<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа84<br />
oven for reheating. The dishes<br />
should be easy to transport. Everybody will take only a small portion<br />
of each dish as there are many from<br />
which to choose.<br />
Natalie is going to make shepherd’s pie – a traditional English<br />
dish. In England shepherd’s pie is traditionally made with<br />
mutton. Americans usually make shepherd’s pie with<br />
beef. The English (and Australians and New Zealanders)<br />
call the beef dish a “cottage pie”. Whatever the name is,<br />
you do it in the same way. You make several layers<br />
of cooked minced meat and vegetables, with mashed potatoes on top, and bake it in the oven.<br />
2c. Read the letter again and say if the sentences are true or false.<br />
Explain why.<br />
1. A potluck party is a party where people make food in pots.<br />
2. For a potluck party everyone is asked to bring some dishes.<br />
3. All dishes are cooked when people gather together. 4. You<br />
can eat the whole dish if you wish. 5. Shepherd’s pie is traditionally made with mutton. 6. In America people call it a “cottage pie”. 7. Shepherd’s pie is several layers of cooked minced<br />
meat and vegetables, with mashed potatoes on top.<br />
2d. Discuss the difference between cottage and shepherd’s pie and<br />
what other similar pies one can make.<br />
3a. What ingredients do you use to make draniki?<br />
3b. Listen to the telephone conversation and write down the<br />
recipe for draniki.<br />
3c. Discuss with your partner what you would like to have for<br />
the potluck party.<br />

potluck party except draniki or kolduny.<br />

Lesson 9. Harry Potter<br />
1. Discuss the questions with your class.<br />
1. Do you prefer reading books or watching films about<br />
Harry Potter? 2. What do you like about Harry Potter? What<br />
don’t you like?<br />
2. If you haven’t read or watched the films about Harry Potter,<br />
read the following before you read the text.<br />
Harry Potter is a series  of seven fantasy novels<br />
written by a British author J.K. Rowling. The books describe<br />
the adventures of a young wizard Harry Potter, and his best<br />
friends Ron Weasley   and Hermione Granger<br />
, all of whom are students at Hogwarts<br />
 School of Witchcraft  and Wizardry<br />
. Harry has just arrived at Hogwarts, which is a boarding school, to start his education.<br />
3a. Listen, read the text and say what meal Harry Potter had:<br />
breakfast, lunch or dinner.<br />
A lbus Dumbledore had got to his feet. He was smiling at the students, his arms opened wide, as if (как будто) nothing<br />
could have pleased him more than to see them all there.<br />
“Welcome!” he said. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts!<br />
Before we begin our dinner, I would like to say a few words. And<br />
here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you!”<br />
He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered.<br />
Harry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now<br />
full of food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat<br />
on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb<br />
chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, chips, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup<br />
and, for some strange reason, mint humbugs (мятные конфеты).<br />
His aunt and uncle had never exactly kept him hungry, but<br />
Harry had never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. His<br />
cousin had always taken anything that Harry really wanted,<br />
even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of<br />
everything, except the humbugs, and began to eat. It was all<br />
delicious.<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа88<br />
When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food went from the plates, leaving them clean<br />
as before. A moment later the puddings appeared. Blocks of ice<br />
cream in every flavour you could think of, apple pies, treacle<br />
tarts, chocolate йclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, jellies, and rice pudding.<br />
At last, the puddings disappeared and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The Hall fell silent.<br />
“Just a few more words now we are all fed and watered.<br />
I have a few notices to give you.”<br />
“First-years should note that the forest in the grounds<br />
is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would<br />
do well to remember that as well.”<br />
“I have also been asked by Mr Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes<br />
in the corridors.”<br />
After the meal the boys were directed to their bedrooms.<br />
Harry was going to ask Ron if he had had any of the treacle<br />
tart, but went asleep almost at once.<br />
(adapted from Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone by J.K. Rowling)<br />
3b. Listen, read the text again and pay attention to the<br />
dishes Harry and his friends were treated with. Fill in the table.<br />
Main course Side dish Pudding<br />
Roast beef<br />
...<br />
Boiled potatoes<br />
...<br />
Apple pie<br />

It’s easy to cook … . We need the following ingredients: … .<br />
First, we … . Then we … . Finally, we … .<br />
4. Make a party menu using the table you have just made (see ex. 3b).<br />

4a. Alesya’s father has a huge collection of coins and a big<br />
library of books on the history of money. Listen and read the page<br />
from one of his books and check your answers in ex. 3. Who’s the<br />
winner in the game show?<br />
W hy did people start using money? At first people tered, which means they exchanged things they had for barthings they needed. A farmer who had cattle wanted to have<br />
salt, so cattle became a form of money.<br />
Throughout their history people have<br />
used different things as money: knives<br />
and rice in China, cattle in Babylonia,<br />
tobacco in America, whales’ teeth and<br />
shells on the Pacific islands.<br />
The first government to make coins<br />
that looked alike and use them as money was probably the city of Lydia in<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа92<br />
Ancient Greece. The coins were made<br />
from a mixture of gold and silver. But<br />
they were heavy and difficult to carry,<br />
and the cities and the roads of Europe<br />
were dangerous places to carry huge<br />
purses with gold. In the early 1700s,<br />
France’s government became the first<br />
in Europe to make paper money –<br />
banknotes or bills as they say in the US.<br />
But paper money, as well as the first<br />
coins ever, was invented in China,<br />
where traveller Marco Polo saw it in the<br />
1280s. Now people carry plastic credit<br />
cards in their wallets instead of cash, which makes travelling<br />
even safer and more convenient. With your credit card you can<br />
take money from the cash machine at any time you need it.<br />
When you go to a foreign country, one of the first things<br />
you may see is what money looks like. Banknotes of different<br />
countries show queens or presidents or other famous people.<br />
But you also may find a tiger or elephant (India), cows and<br />
fruit (Nigeria), a map (Norway), or even schoolchildren<br />
(Taiwan).<br />
Many countries in Europe<br />
now have the same currency; all<br />
their coins and paper money are<br />
euros. Great Britain, however,<br />
is still using pounds. People in<br />
France and Italy miss their currencies – francs and lire. But<br />
they agree that now money<br />
travels easily from one country<br />
to another. This makes it easier to make financial deals between<br />
countries. And tourists can use the same kind of money to pay<br />
for a slice of pizza whether it’s in Italy or in France. People<br />
travelling to other countries usually need to convert (change)<br />
their money into the local currency. For that an exchange rate<br />
(курс обмена валют) is used.<br />

as detention tomorrow. What am I<br />
going to do?<br />
John!<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа99<br />
Dilemma: What does John do? (What is the best decision?)<br />
a) Miss the paper round and maybe lose his job; b) Say sorry<br />
to Miss Bailey and tell her the truth; c) Do the paper round<br />
and miss the detention.<br />
Fact 1: When you are 13 years old you can get a paper round<br />
in the mornings, evenings or at the weekend to earn some extra<br />
money. When you are 15 you can get a Saturday job in a shop<br />
or work in a restaurant.<br />
Fact 2: GCSEs are very important exams that English students take when they are 16.<br />
2b. John didn’t get lots of money out of the cash machine. He decided<br />
to find a way to earn money. He also said sorry to Miss Bailey and<br />

food<br />
savings<br />
clothes<br />
books &amp; magazines<br />
school things<br />
mobile phones<br />
beauty products<br />
public transport<br />
cinema, DVDs, concerts<br />

sport and fitness<br />
other needs or wants<br />
1b. What would you like to spend more / less on? What’s the most<br />

much money on something recently? How have your spending<br />
habits changed over the last few years? ( I used to spend … Now<br />
I spend …)<br />
2a. Listen to the radio programme on how<br />
to budget. Who is this programme for: children,<br />
teenagers or adults?<br />
2b. Fill in the missing words.<br />
S o, our young listeners keep asking us how to budget. If you budget, you don’t just spend or save, you plan how to<br />
spend, you plan your … (1).<br />
A family … (2) shows all the money that comes into the family and all the ways that money will be spent, usually on things<br />
like housing, school, clothes, food, cars and other things.<br />
The government’s budget shows how much money it plans<br />
to get and where it will spend that money – on such things<br />
as education, roads, energy, etc. Sometimes governments too<br />

Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа101<br />
spend more than they get. If you spend more money than you<br />
get, you will have a “budget deficit”.<br />
Make your own budget! Grown-ups are not the only ones<br />
who have to worry about … (3). Children must become more …<br />
(4) too. Say you’d like to buy a new video game, but you don’t<br />
have any money saved. Make a budget to see if you can afford<br />
to put a few pounds a week towards the new game. You may<br />
be surprised to see how you spend your money.<br />
Here’s how to make your own budget: write down every single thing you spend money on each week and how much it costs.<br />
Your list may include cinema, CDs and food. Now add<br />
up (сложите) how much you earn each week from pocket money, babysitting or a paper round.<br />
Subtract (вычтите) the money you spend from the money<br />
you earn. If there’s money left over – you are doing well.<br />
If there’s no money left or you come up with a negative number, you have a budget deficit. In case you have a budget deficit, look at each item on your “spend” list to see if there’s anything that you can cut. … (5) your careless expenses and you<br />
will be able to buy the things you really need.<br />
Some of the rich are … (6) not because they have always had<br />
a lot of money but because they have been budgeting and the<br />
poor are … (7) because they haven’t.<br />
the rich = rich people; the poor = poor people<br />
2c. Listen again and check yourselves.<br />
3. Read carefully the advice beginning with the words “Here’s how<br />
to make your own budget”. Follow the economist’s advice. Have you<br />

following topics are the people discussing?<br />
1. Pocket money 2. Saving money<br />
3. Getting paid for chores 4. Earning money<br />
A Children should do some things for free, like cleaning their<br />
own room. But they should get paid to do other chores like<br />
babysitting. I think it’s fair. Barbara<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа103<br />
When I was about fourteen, I started getting pocket money,<br />
which was much more than my friends’ pocket money amounts.<br />
But I had to buy my clothes and hair stuff and magazines and<br />
records and so on. It was great because I felt rich at first, but<br />
it also taught me to budget and to understand that I couldn’t<br />
buy everything. Edward<br />
C Parents should pay their children to do housework. And<br />
that should be the only money they get. That way they learn<br />
to be responsible. John<br />
D I completely disagree!!! Paying children to do chores is a<br />
mis take! They’ll start asking money for everything. Rupert<br />
E When I was 13–14, my Mum used to give me £5 a week for<br />
doing work around the house like washing up, tidying my room,<br />
doing the ironing, etc. I never used to spend it… and as the weeks<br />
went on, the cash went up and up and up… and when I wanted<br />
to buy a new game or a new top I was able to buy it. ☺ I still do those<br />
chores every day now… I don’t get paid now though. / Fiona<br />
F I’ve been getting £25 a month since I was about 11 and a half.<br />
Joe<br />
G I buy and sell stuff on the Internet so I make around £60–80<br />
a week usually, sometimes more, sometimes less. I don’t spend<br />
much, I’ve been saving my money for a year and I’ve saved a lot!<br />
Well, the rich are getting richer, you know. Ricci<br />
H I think a fair amount is about £20 a month. If they want<br />
more things, they’ll have to save or earn it. Brenda<br />
I My 13-year-old gets £10 a month; my younger two get £5<br />
a month. This is just for saving or buying bigger things that<br />
I won’t buy till birthdays or Christmas. I would love to give my eldest her pocket money but in our family every penny counts –<br />
we hardly make ends meet. Having said that, she is a very responsible girl and she can budget. When she gets some cash, I know<br />
she will spend it wisely. She’s starting a weekend job at Easter,<br />
no paper rounds round here, so it’s only holiday work. Belinda<br />
B<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа104<br />
J I don’t get any pocket money. However, my parents do give<br />
me money when I ask for it, like when I go out with friends.<br />
Some of that money is saved so I can buy little things for<br />
myself.When I’m a parent, I’ll give my children a lot of pocket<br />
money. ☺ Pat<br />

And sometimes I do get some extra money. I think this money<br />

In the morning.<br />
Natalie: Well, Alesya, I’m rich today. I (1. earn) some money<br />
from the paper round, I’ve got the money for the chores and<br />
I’ve got my pocket money, so I can waste a couple of quid.<br />
Let’s go and spend.<br />
Alesya: What’s quid? Is it seafood?<br />
Natalie: No, silly. It’s an informal word<br />
for pounds – our British currency.<br />
And what’s your currency – euro?<br />
Alesya: No, it’s roubles – Belarusian roubles.<br />
Natalie: I see. Where’s your purse?<br />
Alesya: I don’t have a purse. It’s more<br />
convenient to have a wallet for keeping banknotes, coins and credit cards. Look!<br />
Natalie: Let’s barter! I (2. give) you £1, if you (3. give) me one<br />
banknote with this beautiful building.<br />
Alesya: But it’s not fair! It’s a huge amount of money.<br />
Natalie: I see you (4. learn) quickly. Good for you! But why<br />
do you carry all this Belarusian money with you? …<br />
In the afternoon.<br />
Alesya: I’d like to buy this book for my dad – it’s about old<br />
coins. No, I can’t afford it. It’s too expensive. It costs<br />
£25!!! OK, I’ll buy that one instead. I can get it almost for<br />
free.<br />
Natalie: Let me buy this book for you. I (5. save) to buy you<br />
a good present. Look, I (6. save) £50.<br />
Alesya: Never! I don’t want any charity. And this book is not<br />
for me, it’s for my father.<br />
Natalie: Let’s not argue, shall we? I’ve decided. I (7. lend) you<br />
this money, and you’ll pay me back when I (8. come) to Belarus….<br />

In the evening.<br />
Natalie: Look, Alesya! I’ve got only I pence left – just a penny.<br />
I (9. be) as rich as Croesus in the morning and now I’m<br />
as poor as a church mouse. I’ve got no cash! And the stuff<br />
I’ve bought for myself is such a waste!<br />
Alesya: You must learn how to budget and cut down your expenses or you’ll have to make ends meet next month.<br />
Natalie: Yes, you are right. I must be more responsible.<br />
Oh, I know! I (10. sell) my Barbie dolls collection on the<br />
Internet!<br />
Alesya: Oh, Natalie…<br />

What did they have to do?<br />
1b. Listen to a fragment from a radio programme. What does<br />
it tell you about one of the international English exams?<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа107<br />
2a. Study the graph below. What can you make of it? Does anything<br />
surprise you?<br />
How the Poor, the Middle class and the Rich<br />
spend their money<br />
Type of spending<br />
Household income<br />
$15,000–<br />

2b. Read the description below and compare with your ideas.<br />
T he graph shows how Americans spend their money and how budgets change with the change of income1.<br />
The visual demonstrates what money is spent on in three income categories – 1) the poor – people who just make ends meet,<br />
2) people in the middle of the income range and 3) the rich.<br />
Both the similarities and the differences are striking2.<br />
1 income  – доход; 2 striking  – впечатляющий<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа108<br />
Everyone spends a much larger part of their budget<br />
on housing – getting somewhere to live. With all the three categories – the poor, middle class and rich families – the same<br />
amount of money goes on clothing and shoes, and food outside<br />
the home.<br />
But the poor spend a much larger part of their budget on basic things such as food at home, utilities (electricity, gas, train<br />
service, etc.) and health care. Rich people can afford to invest<br />
a much bigger amount of money in education, and to spend<br />
a very large part of their income on saving for retirement – the<br />
period in their life when they have stopped working.<br />
Do you also find the similarities and differences striking?<br />
2c. Read the description again and find words that are used instead<br />
of the following:<br />
1) the graph, 3) money,<br />
2) people, 4) spend money.<br />
3. Answer the questions.<br />
What do you think most of your family income is spent on?<br />
Do you think it is a good idea to invest money in education?<br />
4a. Look at the data below. Study the pie charts. Does any<br />
statistic surprise you? In pairs, decide what kind of conclusions you<br />
can draw from the visuals.<br />
Average household expenditure, fig. 1<br />

4b. Why do you think the visual is called a pie chart?<br />
4c. Talk on how you could present the information in the visuals<br />
in writing.<br />
Think what words you could use to speak about spending<br />
money, about people who spend money, the amount of money<br />
spent and the types of expenses.<br />
Decide what tense should be used: past or present. Why?<br />
5. Write your comments about the visuals. Before you write,<br />
plan<br />
a) the main ideas you would like to point out;<br />
b) the number of paragraphs;<br />
c) the words you will use to avoid repetition;<br />
d) the tense: Present or Past Simple.<br />
Lesson 8. Project: Debate<br />
1. Choose a motion for your debate.<br />

II. Teenagers should get a lot of pocket money.<br />
2. Work in two groups. One should be opposing the motion; the<br />
other should be proposing the motion.<br />
1. Brainstorm the main points of your speech. Think of facts<br />

what they are going to say; b) make three points about the motion, support each point with facts; c) say what they have said.<br />
3. Vote in favour or against the motion.<br />
The teacher chairs the debate. For the introduction the<br />
teacher states the motion and introduces the teams. Speaker 1<br />
opposes the motion. Speaker 2 proposes the motion. The chair<br />
(teacher) invites the speakers to summarise their arguments<br />
with one sentence each. Then Ss take a vote in favour and<br />
against the motion. The chair announces the results.<br />
Lesson 9. Alexander who used to be rich<br />
last Sunday<br />
1. Listen to the joke. Follow in the book. Is it funny? Explain<br />
why.<br />
She: You see, honey, this bag costs only fifty dollars. Good buy.<br />
He: Yes, goodbye, fifty dollars.<br />
2. When you were a little child, did you use to get<br />
any pocket money? How much? What did you<br />
spend it on? Do you remember making any good<br />
buys?<br />
3. Read and listen to the story. Stop to<br />
answer the questions in the boxes.<br />
I t isn’t fair that my brother Anthony has two dollars and three quarters and one dime and seven nickels and eighteen<br />
pennies. It isn’t fair that my brother Nicholas has one dollar<br />
and two quarters and five nickels and thirteen pennies.<br />
Question 1: A quarter is 25 cent, a dime is 10 cent,<br />
a nickel – 5 cent. Who’s got more money: Anthony<br />
or Nickolas?<br />
It isn’t fair because what I’ve got is … bus tokens (жетоны<br />
на aвтобус). And most of the time what I’ve mostly got is bus<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа111<br />
tokens. And even when I’m very rich, I know that pretty soon<br />
what I’ll have is … bus tokens. I know because I used to be rich,<br />
Last Sunday.<br />
Q. 2: Why is Alexander so unhappy?<br />
Last Sunday Grandma Betty and Grandpa Louie came to visit from New Jersey. They brought salmon (лосось) because<br />
my father likes to eat salmon. They brought plants because<br />
my mother likes to grow plants. They brought a dollar for<br />
me and a dollar for Nick and a dollar for Anthony because –<br />
Mom says it isn’t nice to say this because – we like money.<br />
A lot. Especially me.<br />
My father told me to put the dollar away<br />
to pay for the college. He was kidding (шутил). Anthony told me to use the dollar to go<br />
downtown to a store to buy a new face. Anthony stinks (= he is extremely bad). Nicky<br />
said to take the dollar and bury it in the garden and in a week a dollar tree would grow.<br />
Ha, ha, ha. Mom said if I really want to buy<br />
a walkie-talkie, save my money. Saving money is hard.<br />
Information box: walkie-talkie – a small radio held in the<br />
hand which is used for both sending and getting messages.<br />
Because last Sunday, when I used to be rich, I went to Pearson’s Drug Store and got bubble gum. And even though I told<br />
Q. 3: How did he get his dollar?<br />
Q. 4: What did Alexander’s family recommend<br />
him to do with his money? Were they serious?<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа112<br />
my friend David I’d sell him all the<br />
gum in my mouth for a nickel, he still<br />
wouldn’t buy it. Goodbye, fifteen<br />
cents. I absolutely was saving the rest<br />
(остатки) of my money. I positively<br />
was saving the rest of my money. Except that Eddie called me up and said<br />
that he would rent (даст напрокат) me his snake for an hour.<br />
I always wanted to rent his snake for an hour. Goodbye, twelve<br />
cents.<br />
Q. 5: What did he do with his money?<br />
Anthony said when I’m ninety-nine<br />
I still won’t have enough for a walkie-talkie.<br />
My father said there are certain words a<br />
boy can never say, no matter how bad his<br />
brothers are being. My father<br />
fined (ош тра фовал) me five<br />
cents each for saying them. Goodbye, dime. Last<br />
Sunday, when I used to be rich, by accident<br />
I flushed (смыл) a dime down the toilet. A nickel<br />
fell through a crack (щель) when I walked on my<br />
hands. I tried to get my nickel out with a butter<br />
knife and also my mother’s scissors. Goodbye, eight cents. And<br />
the butter knife. And the scissors.<br />
Q. 6: What happened to the scissors and the butter knife?<br />
Last Sunday when I used to be rich,<br />
I found this chocolate bar just sitting<br />
there and I ate it. How was I to know that<br />
it was Anthony’s? Goodbye, eleven cents.<br />
Q. 7: Why did Alexander say “goodbye” to eleven cents?<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа113<br />
I absolutely was saving the rest of my money. I positively<br />
was saving my money. But then Nick did a magic trick and that<br />
made my coins disappear. He didn’t know the trick to bring<br />
them back. Goodbye, four cents.<br />
Q. 8: Was Nickolas a good magician?<br />
Anthony said that even when I’m 199,<br />
I still won’t have enough for a walkie-talkie.<br />
My father said that there are certain things<br />
a boy can never kick (выкинуть), no matter<br />
how bad his brothers are being. My father<br />
made me pay five cents for kicking it. Goodbye, nickel. Last Sunday when I used to be<br />
rich, Cathy around the corner had a garage<br />
sale (распродажа). I positively only went<br />
to look. I looked at a bear with one eye. I needed that bear.<br />
Goodbye, twenty cents.<br />
Q. 9: Would you buy a one-eyed bear at a garage sale?<br />
I absolutely was saving the rest of my money. I positively<br />
was saving the rest of money. I absolutely positively was saving the rest of my money. Except that I needed to get some<br />
money to save. I looked in Pearson telephone’s booths for nickels and dimes that people sometimes forget. No one forgot.<br />
I brought some non-returnable bottles down to Friendly’s Market. Friendly’s Market wasn’t very friendly. I told my Grandma and Grandpa to come back soon.<br />
Q. 10: Can you guess why?<br />
Last Sunday, when I used to be rich, I used to have a dollar.<br />
I do not have a dollar any more. I’ve got this one-eyed bear.<br />
And … some bus tokens.<br />

British fact file: Holidays in the UK<br />
In Britain you can hear different words about the days when most people do not go to work and celebrate different traditions or simply relax. These days off are called common law<br />
holidays1, bank holidays and public holidays. Why? What’s the<br />
difference?<br />
We can find an explanation in history and law.<br />
Before 1834 about thirty-three saints’2 days and religious<br />
 festivals were celebrated as holidays, but in 1834<br />
only four were left: 1 May, 1 November, Good Friday3 and<br />
Christmas Day. The name “bank holidays” first appeared<br />
1 common law  holidays – традиционные, общепринятые праздничные дни; 2saint  – святой; 3Good Friday – Страстная пятница <br />
1. Christmas 2. Halloween 3. Mother’s Day<br />
4. New Year 5. Easter 6. Queen’s Official Birthday<br />
7. April Fool’s Day 8. St Valentine’s Day<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа118<br />
in 1871 in the Bank Holidays Act, which was introduced by a<br />
politician () Sir John Lubbock – a Liberal MP1.<br />
A banker, scientist and social reformer, Sir John Lubbock<br />
aimed to ease the life of the working class people when he suggested introducing days off, which were not religious holidays.<br />
As banks were closed, all people had a day off. English people<br />
were so thankful that they called the first Bank Holidays<br />
“St Lubbock’s Days”.<br />
After that, public holidays were renamed or added to the<br />
calendar of different UK countries in different years from<br />
1903 to the present time.<br />
Very often the two words – bank holidays and public holidays – are used interchangeably2 in everyday life, although legally3 there is a difference. Strictly speaking, bank holidays<br />
are holidays when banks and many other businesses are closed<br />
for the day. Public holidays are holidays, which have been celebrated for many years through custom (обычай) and tradition.<br />
In fact, whether holidays are bank or public, is written in the<br />
Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971, which replaced the<br />
Bank Holidays Act 1871.<br />
If a public holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday, it is usually celebrated on the next working weekday, called “a substitute4 public holiday”. Extra bank holidays are created by Royal<br />
proclamation5. For example, the wedding of Charles, Prince<br />
of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer on 29 July 1981, the Golden<br />
Jubilee of Elizabeth II on Monday, 3 June 2002 and the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton on 29 April<br />
2011 were made extra bank holidays.<br />

people still go from house to house singing and collecting money<br />
for charity. Traditionally it is from St Thomas’s Day (21 December) until the morning of Christmas Day.<br />

Year’s Eve, 31 December, so that they can celebrate the start of<br />
the New Year. People see in the New Year with their friends and<br />
family. Sometimes one can be invited to someone’s New Year’s<br />
Eve house party. Many pubs1 and clubs have special events2.<br />
2. A few minutes before midnight, British people traditionally watch Big Ben (the clock in the Houses of Parliament), and<br />
celebrate after it strikes for the 12th time, which is shown<br />
on television. There’s a tradition to join hands at midnight and<br />
sing Auld Lang Syne, written by the Scottish poet Robert Burns.<br />
3. In London, people often gather in the area around Trafalgar Square , Piccadilly  Circus, Leicester  Square and Parliament  Square from about<br />

быть человеком, живущим в доме), but they must not be in<br />
the house when the clock strikes midnight. The First Foot<br />
is traditionally a tall, dark-haired man. In some places a woman or fair-haired man are thought as unlucky. The First Foot<br />
usually brings several gifts, including a coin, bread, salt, coal<br />
(уголь), or a drink (usually whisky) for good luck.<br />

 and the British Monarchy .<br />
The history of this day goes back<br />
centuries.<br />
When Queen Elizabeth I (1533–<br />
1603) took the throne of England in<br />
1558, she made some laws against<br />
the Roman Catholics (). Guy Fawkes was one<br />
of a small group of Catholics who felt that the government was<br />
unfair  to them. People hoped that King James I (from<br />
1603) would change the laws, but he didn’t.<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа131<br />
There were even fines (штрафы) for people who didn’t attend (go to) the Protestant church on Sunday or on holy days.<br />
A group of men plotted to kill King James and blow up the<br />
Houses of Parliament, the place where the laws were made.<br />
a plot – to plot<br />
The men bought a house next door to the parliament building. The house had a cellar (подвал) which went under the parliament building. The plotters planned to put gunpowder under<br />
the house and blow up parliament and the king.<br />
On the morning of 5th November 1605,<br />
soldiers discovered Guy Fawkes with gunpowder in the cellar and arrested him.<br />
He was questioned about the other<br />
plotters. At first, he didn’t tell the soldiers anything about the plot, but later<br />
he told the truth.<br />

In celebration of his survival (), King James I ordered that the people of England should have a great bonfire on<br />
the night of 5th November.<br />
The event is still commemorated<br />
 annually (every year) in England<br />
on 5th November by burning “guys” (= effigies<br />
) on bonfires. As well as burning an effigy of Guy Fawkes, the bonfires are used to bake<br />
potatoes wrapped in foil1 and to warm up soup for<br />
the crowds that come to watch the fireworks. The<br />
traditional cake eaten on Bonfire Night is Parkin<br />
Cake, a sticky cake containing a mix of oatmeal,<br />
ginger, treacle, and syrup2. Other foods include sausages cooked<br />
over the flames and marshmallows3 toasted in the fire.<br />

On this night, people also enjoy fireworks display. Today<br />
only adults can buy them, but in the past they were sold to children, too. So during the days before Bonfire Night, children<br />
used to take their home-made guys out in the street and ask for<br />
“a penny for the Guy” to collect money and buy fireworks.<br />

Interviewer: Hi, Alesya! Welcome to our school radio.<br />
Alesya: Hello, nice to be with all of you today.<br />
Interviewer: People in Britain are going to celebrate St Valentine’s Day soon. This event has helped me to choose the topic<br />
of our talk today. Holidays and special days. In Britain,<br />
holidays usually become traditional and we keep celebrating<br />
them for years and years. Yet, some new holidays appear<br />
in our calendar, some bank holidays are replaced with others. Is it the same in Belarus?<br />
Alesya: Yes, sure. For example, Independence Day. Its history<br />
goes back to 24 November 1996, when the republican referendum moved Independence Day to 3 July. I think it’s<br />
a very important holiday. The day encourages people to remember that we achieved freedom of the country at the cost<br />
of great loss in the past. The day is famous for the traditional military parade in Pobeditelei Avenue and a demonstration, which offer an opportunity to show that independent Belarus and its people have achieved great results and<br />
success in different spheres  of life. It’s a very popular celebration, attracting crowds of people.<br />

3b. Listen and read the text about the history of St Valentine’s<br />
Day and write questions and answers for the game “Matching<br />
Hearts”.<br />
V alentine’s Day is celebrated by millions of people all over the world. The celebration falls on the 14th of February.<br />
On this day, people celebrate and show their love to each other<br />
by giving gifts and cards and perhaps by having a romantic<br />
dinner.<br />
The history of Valentine’s Day – and its patron saint – has<br />
a lot of mysteries. But we do know that February has long been<br />
a month of romance. Customs which have a link with St Valentine’s Day started with the popular belief held by people in<br />
Great Britain and France during the 14th and 15th centuries<br />
that birds begin to mate on 14 February. Lovers, therefore,<br />
found St Valentine’s Day the right time to send love letters and<br />
gifts to the beloved.<br />
But in recent time the festival is seen in a much larger perspective. Now, people take the opportunity of the day to wish<br />
“Happy Valentine’s Day” to anyone they love – their father,<br />
mother, teachers, siblings (brothers and sisters), friends, coworkers or anyone special to them. The idea is to give love and<br />
spread happiness around us.<br />
But, who was Saint Valentine? One legend says that Valentine was a priest who served during the third century in Rome.<br />
When Emperor Claudius II decided that single men made better soldiers than those with wives and families, he outlawed<br />
 marriage (поставил брак вне закона) for young men –<br />
his soldiers. Valentine thought it was unfair and continued<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа142<br />
to marry young lovers in secret. When Valentine’s actions were<br />
discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to death.<br />
There is a legend, that Valentine actually sent the first “valentine” greeting himself. Valentine fell in love with a young girl<br />
who visited him in prison a few times before his death on 14 February. It’s no surprise that by the Middle Ages, Valentine had<br />
become one of the most popular saints in England and France.<br />
Other stories suggest (предполагают) that Valentine was<br />
killed for attempting to help Christians escape Roman prisons<br />
where they were often beaten. In Great Britain, Valentine’s<br />
Day began to be popularly celebrated around the seventeenth<br />
century. By the middle of the eighteenth century, it had become common for friends and lovers in all social () classes to exchange small gifts or handwritten notes. By the end of<br />
the century, printed cards had begun to replace written letters.<br />
Ready-made cards were an easy way for people to express their<br />
emotions in a time when direct expression of one’s feelings was<br />
discouraged. According to the Greeting Card Association, one<br />
billion Valentine cards are sent each year, making Valentine’s<br />
Day the second largest card-sending holiday of the year (2.6 billion cards are sent for Christmas).<br />
4. Make your own Valentines in the shape of hearts.<br />
Remember that the colours of St Valentine’s Day are red,<br />
white and pink. Here are some ideas to help. Read the text<br />
found on Valentines and write your own. It depends on who it is<br />
addressed to – your friend, teacher, sister or brother, mother<br />
or father, someone you love.<br />
With you around sweetheart,<br />

Lesson 1. Traditions on the British roads<br />
1. Cars on the road unite all people. Most people of the world<br />
are drivers. Are there any differences in driving in Belarus and<br />
the UK?<br />
2. Make questions about driving in Britain. Use the prompts.<br />
1. What / like /drive / Britain? What is it like to drive in Britain?<br />
2. petrol1 / expensive / Britain?<br />
3. motorists / have to wear / front seat belts / the UK?<br />
4. what / minimum driving age?<br />
5. many roads / Britain?<br />
6. roads / good / the UK?<br />
7. what / the National Speed limit / the UK?<br />
8. How / all speed limits / given on signs?<br />
9. How / signs / indicate speed limits?<br />
10. Why / drive on the left / in Britain?<br />
3a. Listen, read and match the questions (ex. 2) with parts<br />
of the text.<br />
T he first thing you notice when you come to Britain is that they drive on the left-hand side of the road. Taking the<br />
left-hand side on the road is a custom<br />
or habit that goes back centuries<br />
when people used to carry swords2,<br />
most often in their right hand, to protect themselves. The custom was encouraged by the General Highways Act<br />
of the British Government (1773),<br />

UNIT 6<br />
VERY TRADITIONAL<br />
BRITAIN<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа147<br />
which advised horse riders, coachmen1 and people taking their<br />
vegetables to market to drive on the left. The rule was made<br />
a law by the Highway Act of 1835.<br />
So, the second thing you notice is that the steering wheel is<br />
on the right. However, the pedals are in the same position as in<br />
left-handed cars, with the accelerator  – gas pedal –<br />
on the right.<br />
The gears and almost always the handbrake are both operated with the left hand. Less and less cars on the roads are with<br />
a manual gearbox (с ручной коробкой передач). Most modern<br />
cars are with an automatic gearbox.<br />
Petrol  – 117p – and diesel () – 118p on average<br />
(25 October 2015) are among the most expensive in the world.<br />
The wearing of front seat belts was made mandatory (обязательное) for motorists in 1983.<br />
The minimum age for driving a car in the UK is 17, and 16<br />
for riding a moped or motorbike with a maximum engine capacity (мощность двигателя) of 50cc (cubic centimetres).<br />
There are some 225,000 miles (362,000 km) of roads in Britain. Many of the roads are built on the old roads laid down<br />
by the Romans centuries ago.<br />
Roads in Britain range from wide modern motorways to narrow country lanes usually bordered by hedges, stone walls, grassy<br />
banks of rivers or ditches (рвы). Cities and towns tend to have<br />
compact streets because they go back to the times well before cars<br />
appeared, and were certainly not planned for large lorries2.<br />
The National Speed limits<br />
On motorways and dual carriageways drivers can drive cars<br />
at a speed of 70 mph (112 km/h)<br />
Single carriageway roads: 60 mph (96 km/h)<br />
Built up areas, e.g. towns and villages: 30 mph (48 km/h)<br />
Residential areas: 20 mph (35 km/h)<br />
Grammar focus: The article “a” in set expression<br />
at a speed of<br />

Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа148<br />
All speed limits and distances are given<br />
on signs in miles or miles per hour. One mile<br />
is about 1.6 km. Round signs indicate<br />
(указывают) speed limits with the number<br />
circled by a red band (полоса). When the<br />
speed limit is no longer applied, then there<br />
is a black line crossing through the number.<br />
3b. Act out an interview with British teens about driving. Use the<br />
questions in ex. 2 and the text.<br />
steering wheel – the wheel in a car, bus, etc. that<br />

on the right.<br />
2. The steering wheel is on the right in British cars.<br />
3. The accelerator (gas pedal) is on the right.<br />
4. The gears and almost always the handbrake (parking brake)<br />
are operated with the left hand.<br />
5. Most modern cars in Britain are automatic.<br />

T ony Evans, head of the Olney pancake committee ex- plained: “First ‘Blue Peter’ promised (пообещали) they<br />
(1. come) and (2. film) the children’s pancake races and (3. put)<br />
it on the show. But then they rang and said the producer (4. do)<br />
it. I was cross (=angry) as we (5. mention) they were coming<br />
in all the newspapers, on TV and on the radio, so I wrote<br />
a strong letter to the producer. He said if they came they now<br />
(6. have to) make a big thing of it and get the presenter to race<br />
and it (7. be) in next week’s show.”<br />
“It presented me with a dilemma – either I would have to let<br />
everyone down and say ‘Blue Peter’ were not coming, or I would<br />
have to break with tradition.”<br />
“Over the last few years a lot of the girls have run to collect<br />
money for charity and I thought that the BBC (8. give) the town<br />
publicity so I decided to let him run.”<br />

which had been around for centuries. Do you agree with them? This<br />
is what they said.<br />
“Letting a man in the race means that the traditional idea<br />
has been forgotten and thrown away. Sadly the money interest<br />
has become predominant,” said local resident Geoff Bacchus<br />
.<br />

Another resident Sally Harris, 48, added: “It’s a real shame<br />
this ancient tradition has been ruined. This has always been<br />
something for the women of the town and now it has all been<br />
thrown away. It will never be the same again.”<br />

2. Read about other Easter entertainments. Are they the same<br />
as in Belarus? Explain why egg rolling is popular in Britain, but not<br />
in Belarus.<br />
British fact file<br />
E xchanging and eating eggs is a popu- lar custom in many countries, as<br />
eggs are a symbol of spring and new life.<br />
In the UK real eggs had been used before<br />
they were replaced by chocolate eggs. The<br />
eggs were hard-boiled and dyed in various<br />
colours, which meant spring and light. There is an old traditional game played even today in the north of England, for example at Preston in Lancashire. Hard-boiled eggs are rolled<br />
down hills to see whose egg rolls farthest.<br />
far – farther – the farthest (about distance)<br />

3b. Read these descriptions of sporting traditions in the UK. Some<br />
of the customs or rules may seem strange but they have been<br />
around for hundreds of years. Divide your class into three groups.<br />
Each of them reads one of the texts and gets ready to speak about<br />
the following:<br />
A. When the sporting tradition began. B. Where and when<br />
it is played. C. What the rules are.<br />
Sporting traditions in the UK<br />
1. Traditionally, forty-one days before Easter Sunday is a<br />
special day for Christians, called Pancake Day or Shrove Tuesday. It is the day before Lent (Великий пост) starts. Lent is a<br />
Christian fast (пост) which lasts forty days before Easter.<br />
On Pancake Day people used to celebrate the last day before Easter when they could eat what they wanted. Eggs and milk ought<br />
not to be eaten during Lent. That’s why the eggs, milk and butter left in the house were used for pancakes. All over England<br />
there were pancake races on or near Shrove Tuesday. The tradition is still around today. The rules of pancake races are different in different places, but each participant, usually a woman,<br />
has to wear an apron and a hat or scarf. They run with a pancake<br />
in a frying pan and throw the pancake in the air. They have<br />
to catch it again in the pan. The winner gets to the finishing line<br />
first having thrown the pancake a pre-decided number of times.<br />
The most famous pancake race takes place at Olney. The Olney pancake race is world famous.<br />
2. The Highland Games is a Championship which began<br />
in the middle of the 19th century in the Scottish Highlands.<br />
Games are traditionally held in September. Today they include<br />
highland dancing, contests in playing the bagpipes and one<br />
of the most popular sports – “tossing the caber”. Tossing means<br />
throwing. Players have to throw a long and extremely heavy<br />
pine trunk (ствол сосны) as far as possible. The average caber<br />
weighs  68 kilos and is usually about 6 metres long.<br />
The heaviest caber in the history of caber tossing weighed 127 kilos. The player who throws his wooden caber the furthest<br />
is not necessarily the winner. The style of throwing is more important than the distance. Players are usually very big and<br />
strong!<br />

3. St John’s Ambulance1 and first-aid volunteers2 are always present at the two-day football match held in Ashbourne<br />
 in the Midlands every spring. The Ashbourne street<br />
football game is one of many street football matches played out<br />
all over the UK. The town is divided into two teams, depending<br />
on where the players live. There can be hundreds of players<br />
in each team and the two goal posts are nearly five kilometres<br />
apart. The ball is not kicked but “hugged” close to the chest<br />
(мяч «обнимают» = прижимают к груди). The shopkeepers in<br />
the centre of town have to cover their windows with wooden<br />
boards3 to protect them from the crowds (толпы) of players.<br />
All locals, both the young and the old, enjoy this very lively<br />
and sometimes violent4 game. The match ends with a few broken arms but people think it is all so much fun. They have been<br />
playing this game every year for more than two centuries. It is<br />
a bit difficult to get the ball from one end of town to the other<br />
and sometimes no goals are scored.<br />
3c. Tell each other about the sporting tradition you have chosen.<br />
3d. In groups answer the questions.<br />
1. Which sport is practised throughout the UK? 2. Which<br />
sport is not usually played by men? 3. Which sport has an incredible number of players? 4. Which sport is the most dangerous? 5. Which sport requires the most physical strength?<br />
6. Which sports involve throwing something?<br />
3e. Discuss with your class.<br />
Which sport do you think is the silliest? Which do you think<br />
is the most difficult? Which sport would you like to try?<br />
4a. Do you know of any sporting traditions in Belarus? Discuss with<br />
your class to collect ideas.<br />

do as the English do<br />
1. Are rules important in people’s lives? What rules do you know?<br />
What are your school rules? Which rules do you always follow?<br />
Which rules do you break?<br />
2a. Listen and read the Good-manners guide prepared by<br />
schoolchildren of Woodland school in England. Which of them are<br />
important to follow? Which of them are less important? Why do you<br />
think so?<br />
In England...<br />
Do say “Excuse me”: if someone is blocking your way<br />
and you would like them to move, say “excuse me” and they<br />
will move out of your way.<br />
Do say “Please” and “Thank you”: it is very good manners to say “Please” and “Thank you”. It is rude if you don’t.<br />
You will notice in England that we say “thank you” a lot.<br />
Do cover your mouth: when yawning or coughing1 always cover your mouth with your hand.<br />
Do shake hands: when you are first introduced to someone, shake their right hand with your own right hand.<br />
Do say “Sorry”: if you bump into someone, say “Sorry”.<br />
They probably will too, even if it was your fault2! This is a<br />
habit and can be seen as very amusing by an “outsider”.<br />
Do smile: a smiling face is a welcoming face.<br />
Do stand in line: in England we<br />
like to form orderly queues (standing<br />
in line) and wait for our turn e.g. getting on a bus. “Queue jumping” is not<br />
welcome.<br />

2 fault  – вина<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа166<br />
Do take your hat off when you go indoors (men only):<br />
it is impolite for men to wear hats indoors especially in<br />
churches.<br />
polite – impolite = not polite, rude<br />
Nowadays, it is becoming more common to see men wearing hats indoors. However, this is still seen as being impolite, especially to the older generations.<br />
Do drive on the left-hand side of the road.<br />
Do open doors for other people:<br />
men and women both open the door for<br />
each other. It depends on (зависит от<br />
того, …) who goes through the door<br />
first.<br />
Do not greet (не приветствуй) people with a kiss: we only kiss people who<br />
are close friends and relatives.<br />
Avoid (избегайте) talking loudly in public.<br />
It is impolite to stare1 at anyone in public.<br />
Do not ask a lady her age: it is impolite.<br />
Do not pick your nose in public: use a handkerchief2<br />
if you need.<br />
Avoid backslapping (похлопывание по спине) and hugging (объятия): this is only done among close friends.<br />
2b. Which rules are the same as in your country?<br />
2c. Write a similar guide for visitors to your country.<br />

Lesson 9. The Last Cowboys<br />
1. Travelling is one more custom followed by almost<br />
everybody in the UK. Every summer millions of British people go to<br />
other countries in search of good weather, beauty and new<br />
experiences. Listen and read about the main characters of the book<br />
“The Last Cowboys” by Harry Horse and answer: What’s real?<br />
What’s fantasy?<br />
a film – to film, a smile – to smile, land – to land, a plan –<br />
to plan<br />
R oo of the book, in Scotland. Roo wants to find her grandfa- is a dog, which lives with Harry Horse, the writer<br />
ther. When he was a puppy he sailed<br />
to America on a ship. He travelled all<br />
over America and had a lot of different<br />
jobs. Roo says her grandfather was a famous film actor and she showed him<br />
to Harry in several films when they were<br />
watching television. He looked like a different dog in each film but Roo said<br />
that’s why he was an actor.<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа168<br />
Of course, Harry finds some of the stories about Roo’s<br />
grandfather hard to believe, but he wants to help Roo find her<br />
grandfather in the Wild West.<br />
They go to America together where they have a lot of adventures.<br />
2. Listen and read the story, divide it into parts and match the<br />
titles with the parts of the story.<br />
The Last Cowboys<br />
I t is not easy to find the Wild West any more, but the Get Lost Travel Agency1 were most helpful. They sold Harry two<br />
tickets for a fourteen-day bus tour  to some of America’s<br />
best attractions. They were going<br />
to visit Hollywood (Roo’s grandfather could be there), the Grand<br />
Canyon (Harry wanted to see this<br />
very much), and a place called<br />
Cowboy Town, which sounded<br />
to Harry very much like the Wild<br />
West.<br />
Harry planned to travel light<br />
this time, so he took the most important things for him – some<br />
clothes, the tent and a few golf clubs (клюшки). But Roo didn’t<br />
understand what travelling light meant. She wanted her ball,<br />
her plastic rabbit, two bones, a drinking bowl, dog biscuits,<br />
flea collar (ошейник от блох) (red), best collar (brown with<br />
studs – со стразами), six tins of Mr Beefy Dog, a hairbrush,<br />
a tin opener and fork, a bowl with “Roo” painted on one side,<br />
a small chewed stick and a beanbag (she sleeps on this sometimes). Oh! How can a small dog have so many things!<br />
Roo behaved badly on the plane. She didn’t want to sit still<br />
in her seat and kept going to the toilet. She said she could hear<br />
a mouse scratching there. She found an old lady’s glove and<br />

At the hotel. Getting ready for the trip.<br />

chewed1 it to pieces. Harry had to apologise to the lady2 and<br />
give her one of his gloves, though it was too big for her. Roo<br />
barked all through the film, 101 Dalmatians and made a baby<br />
cry licking its feet…<br />
Harry was very happy when they finally landed.<br />
When they got to the hotel, the manager said that dogs<br />
can’t stay in a hotel. That’s why Harry had to pay more money<br />
for a doggie bed in the room. It cost twenty dollars and Harry<br />
was sure Roo would not sleep in it!<br />
At midnight Roo ran all over the furniture and said that she<br />
wanted to chase something. At last she fell asleep on top of the<br />
TV. At three o’clock in the morning<br />
she woke up and said she wanted her<br />
dinner (she hadn’t got used to the<br />
time difference3). When eating her<br />
dinner she fell asleep and Harry put<br />
her to the doggie bed. She looked so<br />
good while she was sleeping.<br />
When she got up, Harry was still sleeping. She walked on<br />
the telephone and somehow called room service4. When Harry<br />
woke up, the manager said that Roo had ordered (заказала)<br />
eleven full English breakfasts. Harry had to pay for them<br />
though it was an accident . So he was very angry<br />
with Roo.<br />
Anyway, their tour of America began and they went to a<br />
film studio  in Hollywood to see how a film is made.<br />
First they visited the pavement (тротуар) where all the famous stars leave their handprints. Roo walked on wet cement<br />

difference – она не привыкла к разнице во времени; 4 called room<br />
service – вызвала службу доставки еды в комнату<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа170<br />
and left her paw-prints in a space reserved for<br />
Tom Cruise. Harry hoped Tom would not<br />
be angry.<br />
They wanted to leave the pavement but<br />
at that moment a big gentleman with a large cigar shouted to them to stop. Harry was worried<br />
that the man would attack them for the pawprints on the pavement, but he said he wanted<br />
Roo’s “face”. Roo told him that her face was always on her body<br />
and could not come off.<br />
The gentleman explained that he was the biggest film producer in Hollywood and that he was going to make Roo a film<br />
star. He wanted to film Roo in a commercial1 for dog food. All<br />
Roo had to do was to eat a bowl of Crunchy Munchies and then<br />
turn to the camera and smile. The film producer spent a long<br />
time with Roo, explaining what he wanted her to do. Roo said<br />
she would do it naturally. Then the director shouted “Action”<br />
and the filming began. But as soon as the camera began working<br />
things went wrong. Each time she took<br />
some dog food in her mouth she made<br />
an awful face and looked sick. It took<br />
ninety-seven takes and afterwards Roo<br />
was sick under the director’s desk.<br />
“The biggest film producer” showed<br />
them to the door and told Harry that<br />
Roo’s career in films was finished.<br />
After days of travelling they found<br />
the Wild West and Roo’s grandfather.<br />
(After Harry Horse)<br />

they really into? What styles aren’t very popular?<br />
Tsunami: My favourite music style is techno. I<br />
know lots of people think it’s stupid, but I think it’s<br />
awesome. It’s my favourite music right now, and I listen<br />
to it all the time. When I go to bed, I listen to techno<br />
because it relaxes me and makes me fall asleep faster. I looove<br />
techno!<br />
Justin: I’m fond of hard rock and heavy metal music. My favourite bands are Metallica  and<br />
Nirvana . When I listen to their music at full<br />
volume1, it fills me with energy! But when I work at<br />
the computer, I need some slower and softer music in the background2. I usually listen to hip-hop then. ☺<br />
Nova: I’m really into rap and hip-hop, but I also<br />
listen to all kinds of music. What I look for in a song<br />
is lyrics3 and rhythm. Some songs are so touching<br />
that I listen to them over and over. ☺☺<br />
Mich: I grew up in the country, in my dad’s family<br />
who listened to NOTHING BUT country music; but<br />
I didn’t get into it as much as my brothers. I like any<br />
music that sounds good to my ears – techno, pop, R&amp;B<br />
and others.<br />
Josh: I can’t get into rap! I think the lyrics of most<br />
rap songs are very rude, and they sound so angry and<br />
hateful! Why do people listen to rap?<br />
Click: I can’t stand heavy metal. It’s awful! The<br />
melody is hidden behind men screaming and acting<br />
like crazy4 frogs. Guitar solos can be good, but you<br />
can’t hear them. Most of the time their music sounds like<br />

Oksana: I can listen to Stary Olsa all day every day. They’re<br />
awesome! They play medieval2 folk music, which is very original, expressive, and relaxing. The musicians play a wide range<br />
of instruments such as the Belarusian bagpipe, lyre, gusli, svirel, Jew’s harp (варган), ocarina, Belarusian trumpet, birch<br />
bark trumpet, hudok, tromba marina, and drums. They perform<br />
at theatrical concerts and cultural festivals in Belarus and<br />
abroad. Since 1999, they’ve recorded eleven albums. Stary Olsa<br />
is popular in Belarus and in other countries. They’re successful<br />
because they mix modern songs with old instruments and costumes, and because they use the Internet to show the world their<br />
unique3 musical skills. I listen to Stary Olsa on the Internet, but<br />
I’m dying to see their live performance at a folklore festival!<br />
Rastislav: I like different styles of music, and my favourite<br />
style is classical music. I’m a concertgoer4, and my favourite<br />
concert hall in Minsk is the Belarusian State Philharmonic<br />

which is in Yakub Kolas Square. I go to every concert of the<br />
State Chamber Orchestra1, and every time their performance is<br />
fantastic. The music that they play ranges from the 17th to the<br />
21st centuries, and the orchestra plays it gorgeously. Many<br />
outstanding2 Russian musicians have performed with the orchestra, such as Sviatoslav Richter, a pianist, Mstislav<br />
Rostropovich, a cellist, Yuri Bashmet, a violinist, and others.<br />
Nika: Do you have a favourite Christmas song? Mine is<br />
White Christmas. It’s the most melodious and sentimental<br />
Christmas song, I think. Do you know who wrote it? An American songwriter Irving Berlin! Do you know how he is connected<br />
with our country? He was born in Belarus! His parents immigrated to the United States in 1893, when Irving was 5 years<br />
old. Irving Berlin wrote a lot of songs that became a huge success. The style of his songs was popular (or pop) music. I listen<br />
to his wonderful songs on the Internet. They are about 100 years<br />
old, but they’re much-much better than many modern songs.<br />
Stas: When one says, The Beatles, everyone thinks “The<br />
UK”. When one says, Pesniary, everyone thinks “Belarus”. Pesniary was and is the musical symbol of our country. Pesniary<br />
played traditional instruments for a band such as guitars, drums,<br />
and a keyboard, but they also used a violin, an accordion, a flute<br />
and a saxophone. The music that they played was a combination<br />
of rock and folk, and pop and folk. Some songs – such as Kasiu<br />
Jas Kaniushynu – are energetic, some songs – such as Alesya –<br />
are melodious, but my favourite is Belovezhskaya Pushcha.<br />
Every time I listen to it, I feel how much I love Belarus. Pesniary<br />
were and are loved by Russian people, too. They sang some songs<br />
in Russian, and they performed at concerts in Russia.<br />

T he Beatles Harrison and Ringo Starr. They were from Liverpool, the were John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George<br />
UK. They made their first record1 in 1962, and in two years<br />
they became the most famous group in the world. Teenagers<br />
and their parents, everyone seemed to get crazy about The Beatles music, their clothes, hairstyle, even the way they talked.<br />
The musicians liked to experiment with the sound, and they recorded hundreds of great songs full of new kind of energy.<br />
They recorded 13 studio albums of 211 songs. Some of the most<br />
popular songs of the group were and still are Let it be, Yesterday, Yellow Submarine. After John Lennon was shot dead in a<br />
street in New York in 1980, The Beatles couldn’t play together<br />

solo single was Freedom, and his first album was Life Thru<br />
a Lens. It didn’t sell very well at first, but success came suddenly, when the single Angels came out. Angels is still a hit.<br />
However, there are many more Robbie’s songs that people all<br />
over the world admire, for example, Rock DJ, She’s the one,<br />

C. ALEXANDER RYBAK<br />
T oday Alexander Rybak is one of the most popular solo per- formers in Europe. Alexander Rybak was born on 13th May<br />
1986 in Minsk. When he was five, his family of three moved<br />
from Belarus to Norway. His parents were both musicians, and<br />
teaching their son to play the violin and the piano was the most<br />
natural thing for them.<br />
His success came to him after his amazing victory at Eurovision  in 2009 at the 54th Eurovision song contest in<br />
Moscow, Russia. He finished the contest with a grand total of<br />
387 points, breaking all records. Alexander sang Fairytale, the<br />
song he wrote walking in the mountains on the Norwegian west<br />
coast, the song inspired1 by Norwegian folk music. Fairytale<br />
became a hit in Europe.<br />
After his victory in Eurovision 2009, Alexander Rybak did<br />
not end his connection with Eurovision. In 2014, the musician<br />
composed Still Here for Franklin Halley, a Eurovision Song<br />
Contestant from Malta. In 2015, Alexander prepared a Belarusian group “Milki” for the Belarusian Eurovision selection contest with a song called Accent. This composition came fourth in<br />
the contest.<br />
At the beginning of 2018, Alexander was chosen to represent Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest for the second<br />
time. In the second semi-final on 10 May in Lisbon, Portugal,<br />
Alexander Rybak was number one among eighteen participating countries. On 12 May 2018 Alexander Rybak came 15th<br />
with the song That's How You Write a Song in the Eurovision<br />
final.<br />
Alexander’s life is filled with music – events, concerts,<br />
projects, shows and performances. In 2015, the Norwegian musician took part in the One-to-One transformation show in Russia, where he won the second place.<br />

One of his latest songs (2021) is Stay which he performed<br />

It must be so because his songs are melodious, full of light,<br />
magic, kindness and positivity.<br />

Erik, a deformed man, a genius1 designer2 who was one of the<br />
people who built the Opera house. He secretly made a home for<br />
himself in the catacombs deep down under the Opera house.<br />
He is a real man, but he doesn’t let people see him and he makes<br />
people believe that he is the Opera “ghost”. He’s been frightening the Opera management for many years and has been regularly getting money from them. When he meets Christine and<br />
hears her wonderful voice, he falls in love with her, but<br />
he doesn’t show himself to her.<br />
With the help of the Voice, Christine sings beautifully at the<br />
gala concert3 one night at the Opera. Her old childhood friend<br />
Raoul hears her and remembers his love for her. After the gala,<br />
the Voice, who reveals himself as Eric, comes to Christine and<br />
takes her to live in his home in the catacombs. After two weeks,<br />
when Christine asks him to let her go, he agrees, but only if she<br />
wears his ring and is faithful to him. Christine, for a time,<br />
can’t decide who is better for her: Erik or Raoul. After Christine tells Raoul of Erik, Raoul promises to take her away. They<br />
plan to leave the next day, but as Christine feels sorry for Erik,<br />
she decides to sing for Erik one last time. They don’t know that<br />
Erik has been listening to their conversation.<br />
The last night when Christine sings at the Opera house, Erik<br />
kidnaps4 her during the performance. He begs her to marry him,<br />
but she doesn’t agree. Then Erik offers her a choice: say no, and<br />
he destroys5 the entire6 Opera house, or say yes and marry him.<br />
Christine wants to say no, but soon she realises that Raoul,<br />

and many others. His plays made his theatre the most important company in the country. He also wrote poems and sonnets.<br />
In 1610 he returned to his native town of Stratford-uponAvon. His life was much quieter there. He was very successful<br />
and rich in his time. He had a big house and owned (владел)<br />
a lot of land and he part-owned two theatres in London, where<br />
his plays were regularly performed.<br />
However, this historical figure is still surrounded by mystery. Some critics doubt1 whether he wrote the plays at all.<br />
They argue that for a literary genius  his education<br />
and life experiences were very limited (ограничены) – he was<br />
not a widely travelled author.<br />

But a recently published book by James Shapiro proves that<br />
the plays are Shakespeare’s own, though many of his later<br />
plays were co-written.<br />
The fact is that Shakespeare’s plays are still popular today<br />
and performed in lots of theatres round the world.<br />
B. Arthur Conan Doyle <br />
was born on 22 May 1859 in Edinburgh,<br />
Scotland, to a father of Irish origin, Charles<br />
Altamont Doyle, and an Irish mother, Mary<br />
Foley.<br />
Conan Doyle was sent to the Roman Catholic Jesuit school, Stonyhurst, at the age<br />
of nine and then continued at Stonyhurst<br />
College.<br />
From 1876 to 1881, he studied medicine at the University<br />
of Edinburgh. In 1885 he became a doctor of medicine1.<br />
Several times from 1891 to 1892 Conan Doyle tried to open<br />
a medical practice, first in Plymouth , then in Portsmouth  and finally in London. Business was never very<br />
successful and he had a lot of free time to discover a range of<br />
other talents and interests. He joined football, bowling, political, literary and cricket clubs and began writing stories again.<br />
His first story appeared in Edinburgh before he was twenty.<br />
He was married twice – in 1885 and then in 1907 after his<br />
first wife’s death, and had five children in these two marriages.<br />
His first notable literary creation, called A Study in Scarlet, appeared in 1887. It introduced Sherlock Holmes and his<br />
friend Dr. Watson () for the first time.<br />
In 1892, the first out of five collections of Sherlock Holmes<br />
stories was published. In 1893, the year of his father’s death,<br />
Doyle decided to kill Sherlock Holmes and did so in December<br />
that year. He wanted to be remembered for his historical novels<br />
rather than his detective. But the government and public wanted to see Sherlock Holmes back to life, so a story about Sherlock Holmes’s secret mission for the government during a time<br />
of war appeared in 1903. 1917 was the last year a Sherlock<br />
Holmes story was published.<br />

By 1920, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had become one of the<br />
highest paid writers in the world. But after the death of his son<br />
Kingsley, his brother Innes and other close relatives shortly<br />
after World War One and his mother’s death in 1921 Doyle was<br />
in deep depression. He found comfort in spiritualism, which<br />
tried to find proof of life after death. On 7 July 1930, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle died from heart disease.<br />
As an author, he wrote plays, verse, memoirs ,<br />
short stories, historical novels (The Lost World), and supernatural fiction. But he will be mostly remembered as the creator<br />
of one of the greatest literary detectives ever to live.<br />
C. Joanne Rowling , author of the best-selling Harry Potter series of books, was born on 31 July 1965, the<br />
same day as her famous boy-wizard hero.<br />
The family, including her parents and<br />
younger sister Di, lived near Bristol, in<br />
south-west England. Her father worked on<br />
airplane engines for Rolls Royce.<br />
Joanne – called Jo by her family and<br />
friends – did well at school, and was the top<br />
girl in her class. Her favourite subjects<br />
were English and foreign languages. After<br />
finishing public school with top honours1<br />
in English, French, and German, Rowling went on to study<br />
French at the University of Exeter . She graduated from<br />
the university in 1986 and over the next few years worked as a<br />
secretary in different firms.<br />
What she really wanted to do, however, was to write. Rowling wrote her first story, Rabbit, at the age of five or six. Later, she tried her hand at writing novels, but she had never finished writing any novel before she wrote the Harry Potter<br />
books. It was during the difficult time when she came back<br />
to Britain with a baby daughter after her unsuccessful marriage in Portugal.<br />
Following its publication in Britain in June 1997, Harry<br />
Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone quickly became a hit<br />
with children and adults alike and won numerous awards2. The<br />
Harry Potter series includes seven books – one book for every<br />

year that Harry spends at Hogwarts. In 2000, the 35-year-old<br />
author J.K. Rowling became the highest-earning woman<br />
in Britain. She received an OBE (Order of the British Empire<br />
), a medal awarded by the Queen, in March 2001.<br />
At the end of that same year, she married her second husband,<br />
and in 2003 and 2005 gave birth to a boy and a girl.<br />
In 2008 she was named the 12th richest person in Britain.<br />
Rowling’s books have been translated into more than 60 languages, and more than 300 million copies have been sold around<br />
the world. The first four books have been made into films, and<br />
all four are among the top twenty highest-grossing films of all<br />
time. In February 2004, Forbes magazine named her as the first<br />
person ever to become a billionaire  from writing books.<br />
After finishing the Harry Potter series in 2007, J.K. Rowling went on to write a detective series under a pseudonym of<br />
Robert Galbraith. The first book in the series, the Coocoo’s<br />
Calling, was published in April 2013 as a debut novel and the<br />
real name of the author was kept secret for some time. The other books in the series are The Silkworm, which was released in<br />
June 2014, Career of Evil (October 2015), Lethal White (September 2018), and the fifth novel, Troubled Blood, published<br />
in September 2020.<br />
In 2020, Joanne Rowling returned to children’s books and<br />
from 26 May to 10 July published online a new children’s story<br />
called The Ickabog. Free access to the book was Joanne Rowling’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. A print edition of the<br />
story was released on 10 November 2020, and a lot of the money from the book sale was donated to charity. On 13 April 2021,<br />
it was announced that a new children’s book – The Christmas<br />
Pig – would be released in October 2021.<br />
D. Vladimir Korotkevich (26 November<br />
1930 – 25 July 1984) is an extremely talented<br />
Belarusian author who was born in 1930 in Orsha, Vitebsk region. In 1954 he graduated<br />
from the Philological Department of Kiev University and taught first in a village school<br />
in the Kiev region of Ukraine and then in his<br />
home town, Orsha. Later, he completed a literature (1960) and then cinematography (1962)<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа215<br />
course in Moscow. Literature became his main occupation. His<br />
first published work was a poem which appeared in 1951, and<br />
was later followed by three collections of verse. V. Korotkevich<br />
also wrote a number of novels, including The Dark Castle Olshansky and The Wild Hunt of King Stakh («Дзікае паляванне<br />
караля Стаха», 1964), as well as plays, essays, articles, screenplays for films, and some very interesting detective and adventure stories. He is a winner of several national literary awards.<br />
This is how Andrei Khadanovich, a modern Belarusian poet,<br />
describes his first experience of reading Korotkevich: “It was<br />
1989. I was 16 years old. I unfolded the book by Uladzimir<br />
Karatkevich with the first part of The Ears of Rye under Thy<br />
Sickle («Каласы пад сярпом тваiм»). It was an unbelievable<br />
experience. I lost track of time and came back to reality only<br />
when I had finished the book. When you have opened the book<br />
it’s difficult to close it. I was looking forward to reading its<br />
continuation like today’s children look forward to reading another Harry Potter book.”<br />
Korotkevich has a lot to offer. His literary works are full<br />
of romanticism, rich imagination and emotions. They encourage love and respect to our motherland.<br />

Jacqueline Wilson is a British best-selling children’s novelist. Only in the UK, her books sold more than 40 million copies.<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа216<br />
Since her first published book in 1969,<br />
she had written 112 of them by March<br />
2021. Her books are about children and the<br />
problems they face in their families, with<br />
friends and at school.<br />
Jacqueline Wilson has numerous<br />
awards in literature. From 2002 to 2008,<br />
she was the most borrowed author in British libraries. From 2005 to 2007, she was<br />
the fourth Children’s Laureate – a position<br />
given once every two years to writers and illustrators of children’s books for their great achievements (достижения) in this<br />
field.<br />
In 2017, Jacqueline Wilson was given a BAFTA1 Special<br />
Award for her contribution to the development of children’s<br />
television. A number of her books were adapted for television<br />
series, e.g. The Story of Tracy Beaker (2002–2005), Best<br />
Friends (2004), Tracy Beaker Returns (2010–2013), Hetty<br />
Feather (2015–2020). In 2020 the first feature film2 Four Kids<br />
and It, based on her book Four Children and IT (2012) was released. The book My Mum Tracy Beaker (2018) was adapted<br />
for a television series with the same title in 2021.<br />
In 2002, Jacqueline Wilson was appointed an OBE – Officer<br />
of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire [empa] for<br />
services to literacy in schools, and in 2008 she was appointed a<br />
DBE – Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire.<br />
It means that the title Dame should be used before her name.<br />
Jacqueline Aitken was born on 17 December 1945 in Bath,<br />
156 km west of London. Though her parents stayed together,<br />
they were not happy, and Jacqueline herself did not feel happy<br />
in her childhood either. She describes her mother as a person<br />
who always thought she knew best and who never liked any of<br />
her friends.<br />
Jacqueline left school at the age of 16 and began training as a<br />
secretary, but chose to work on a girl’s magazine Jackie instead3<br />
for a Scottish publishing and television company DC Thomson.<br />

Jacqueline married a policeman Millar Wilson at 19 in<br />
1965, had a baby girl Emma at 21, but the marriage finally<br />
broke up in 2004. By the way, when Emma was 9, she asked her<br />
mum never to write about her in her books. And Jacqueline<br />
does her best to keep the promise.<br />
At the moment, Jacqueline Wilson lives happily in a large<br />
country house in Sussex with beautiful opening views, a library and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, and a special room<br />
where there is a collection of toys. And she keeps to her rule –<br />
never to get up until she has written at least 500 words to follow her usual regime [] – two books a year.<br />
On 18 March 2021, her latest book The Runaway Girls<br />
was released. The book is about the events in Victorian London<br />
of 1851.<br />

Infographic “Reading<br />
in the mobile era”<br />
5. How do you see the future of books? Listen, read and say<br />
which point of view you agree with and why.<br />
T here are many factors to consider when discussing the matter of ebooks vs. printed books. Enthusiastic fans of<br />
printed books say that there’s nothing like the smell of paper<br />
and the rustle of the pages as the reader turns them gently with<br />
their fingers. There is something fascinating about the experience of looking through the whole book and the possibility to<br />
see the whole book.<br />
On the other hand, those who prefer the ebook often say<br />
that the device takes a lot of weight from their shoulders – literally. With the ebook, a reader can take hundreds of books<br />
with them on a journey, to school or to work, which only take<br />
up a few square centimetres in their bag.<br />
There is one more important factor proving that printed<br />
books are still a better choice. A study conducted by Sesame<br />
Workshop1 found that children’s development is more effective<br />
with a printed book rather than with an ebook. Reading a printed book offers a range of opportunities for parents to interact<br />
with their children: grown-ups usually talk to children while<br />
reading, helping them understand what is read and encouraging<br />
them to use language to speak about the text. The research concluded that while ebooks also bring stories and encourage children to interact with add-ons, there is nothing to encourage the<br />
child to use language. In fact, the added features can distract<br />
(отвлечь) children from reading and understanding the story.<br />
How will the fight of the digital era end? Will ebooks or<br />
printed books come out on top?<br />

you have read recently? Which book would you like to recommend<br />
to your friends and classmates?<br />
2. One of the best ways to recommend a book is to write a book<br />
review. Read how to write a book review and put its parts in a logical<br />
order.<br />
Model. 1 – B.<br />
A. Body describes the main parts of a story: theme, plot,<br />
setting, characters and your opinions about the book.<br />
B. A book review describes, analyses and evaluates1. It includes an opinion and a recommendation and is addressed to a<br />
future reader. It is usually made up of the following parts: introduction, body, and conclusion.<br />
C. The theme is the main idea of the story. Write what you<br />
think the theme is and how you know.<br />
D. Introduction gives information about the title, author<br />
and genre of the book. You could write what kind of story it is<br />
(exciting / interesting / scary).<br />
E. The setting is the time and place of the story. Think about<br />
these questions: Is it set a long time ago or now? Does it take<br />
place in another country or in an imaginary place? How much<br />
time passes in the story – a day? a year? a lifetime?<br />
F. The characters are who the story is about. The main character is called the protagonist. Who are the other important<br />
characters? Do they help or hinder (мешают) the protagonist?<br />
G. The plot is what happens. You ought to write what the<br />
story is mostly about, but you ought not to retell the whole story in detail. What is the main event or conflict ? What<br />
things lead up (ведут) to it? What happens as a result ?<br />
You should avoid telling the ending, or giving away the secrets<br />
of the story.<br />

Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа222<br />
H. Conclusion is just one or two most important things that<br />
you want other people to know about the book.<br />
I. Opinions give your thoughts and evaluation of the book.<br />
Some questions you might want to answer are:<br />
Did you like the story? Why or why not? What was the best<br />
part of the book? Why?<br />
How did the story make you feel? What new things did you<br />
learn from this book? Who would you recommend it to?<br />
3a. Listen and read the review of the book Best Friends<br />
by Jacqueline Wilson and point out parts of this review.<br />
B est Friends thor of more than a hundred works, including award-win- is a book by Jacqueline Wilson, who is the auning books The Suitcase Kid, The Lottie Project, Bad Girls,<br />
The Story of Tracy Beaker, Vicky Angel and the Girls four-book<br />
series.<br />
Best Friends is about a little girl called Gemma. She’s a tomboy (a girl who takes part in activities and games that people<br />
think are better for boys), always getting into trouble and annoying adults – but she’s actually a lovely, real, believable<br />
child whom you can’t but like. Her best friend is Alice, though<br />
they are completely the opposite. Alice is very girly with her<br />
dolls, ballet classes and pretty party dresses.<br />
They have been friends all their lives as they were born<br />
in the same hospital on the same day. They have celebrated all<br />
their birthdays together and have always been best friends,<br />
hoping it will be so forever.<br />
But then Alice’s father gets a new job and they have to move<br />
house. The girls hate the idea of being separated, so they make<br />
up a plan to run away together. But what happens then? You’ll<br />
have to read the book yourself to learn it.<br />
Best Friends examines the ending of one friendship and the<br />
beginning of a new one. But the author does not only examine<br />
the main characters. We also discover the relationships1 between children and their parents. Sometimes Gemma and Alice<br />
believe their parents are being unkind, but they also understand how helpful, kind and loving they are. We can also see<br />
1 relationships () – отношения<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа223<br />
the relationships between children and<br />
their grandparents. All of these are described in a realistic and believable way,<br />
where love is placed at the top, which is a<br />
great positive message for readers.<br />
Overall, the book is really fascinating,<br />
enjoyable and encouraging. The characters<br />
are so realistic that you are transported<br />
 into their world and become<br />
part of it. It’s an excellent read.<br />
Though it is more of a girly book than one for boys, everyone, including girls, boys and grown-ups, will find something<br />
interesting for themselves. Once (= when) they start reading<br />
it they will end up swallowing («проглатывая») a hundred pages at one sitting and only stopping because it’s late at night.<br />
3b. Would you like to read the book? Why?<br />
3c. Analyse the language of the book review. Which verb tenses are<br />
used in each part of the review? Why?<br />
NB: The Present Simple Tense is usually used for retelling<br />
the plot of a book.<br />
3d. Write the plan of a book review. From each part of the review<br />
write out beautiful words, word combinations or sentences which<br />
you can use in your own book review.<br />
Lesson 8. Project “Book fair”<br />
Get ready to take part in the class project “Book fair”.<br />
You’ve made sure (убедились) that reading is fascinating.<br />
In fact, we cannot live a day without reading. It opens numerous doors into the world and gives us a lot of moments of joy.<br />

different countries, living different lives, exploring the Earth<br />
and discovering its mysteries.<br />

Sue Townsend (2 April 1946 – 10 April 2014, lived in Leices- ter ) wrote a range of novels and plays, but will be best<br />
known for her character Adrian Mole, who quickly became<br />
a national treasure, along with his author<br />
and creator. Adrian Mole, born 2 April<br />
1967, is one of Britain’s most beloved fictional characters, who first appeared in a<br />
BBC Radio 4 play in 1982. Today Adrian<br />
Mole is the central character and the narrator of one of the longest sagas in British<br />
literature, including nine books, which<br />
picture the British life from the 1980s<br />
to the late 1990s. The books written in the form of a diary were<br />
translated into 34 languages and were adopted for radio plays,<br />
three TV series, a musical and theatrical plays, performed<br />
in many countries.<br />

Eight days have gone by since Christmas Day but my mother<br />
still hasn’t worn the green lurex  apron I bought her<br />
for Christmas!<br />
Friday January 2nd<br />
Bank Holiday in Scotland. Full Moon<br />
The dog got its own back on my father.<br />
It jumped up and knocked down his model ship,<br />
then ran into the garden with the rigging1 tangled in its feet. My father kept saying, “Three<br />
months’ work wasted,” over and over again.<br />
Saturday January 3rd<br />
I shall go mad through lack (нехватка) of sleep! My father<br />
has banned (запретил) the dog from the house so it barked outside my window all night. Just my luck! My father shouted<br />
a swear-word  at it. If he’s not careful he will be arrested<br />
by the police for obscene2 language. She still hasn’t worn the<br />
lurex apron. I will be glad to get back to school.<br />

Second after Christmas<br />
My father has got the flu3. I’m not surprised with the diet<br />

(чудо) we don’t get scurvy (цинга).<br />

The dog has run off because my mother didn’t close the gate<br />
(калитка). I have broken the arm on the stereo. Nobody knows<br />
yet, and with a bit of luck my father will be ill for a long time.<br />
He is the only one who uses it apart from me. No sign of the apron.<br />
Monday January 5th<br />
The dog hasn’t come back yet. It is quiet without it.<br />
My mother rang the police and gave a description of the dog.<br />
She made it sound worse than it actually is: straggly hair<br />
(шерсть клочками) over its eyes and all that. I really think the<br />
police have got better things to do than look for dogs, such<br />
as catching murderers. I told my mother this but she still rang<br />
them. Serve her right1 if she was murdered because of the dog.<br />
My father is still lazing about in bed. He says he is ill, but<br />
I saw he is still smoking!<br />
lazy (adjective) – laze about (verb)<br />
Nigel came round (зашел в гости) today. He has got a tan<br />

soon from the shock of the cold in England. I think Nigel’s parents were wrong to take him abroad.<br />

the films of today?<br />
3b. Listen, read the text and check your answers.<br />
C inema was born at the end of the nineteenth century. It began with the invention of the camera. The first films<br />
were short, sometimes only a few minutes. They<br />
were shown in different places like clubs, shops,<br />
and music halls. For the first thirty years<br />
of their history, movies were silent . The<br />
first sound films appeared in 1928. In fact, several people may be called the inventors of cinema, but the Frenchmen – the Lumiere <br />
brothers – were the first to present moving pictures to a group of paying people and that is why they are<br />
called the fathers of modern cinema. Today’s cinema is full<br />
of superb colour and fantastic sound and computer effects.<br />

I agree with the speaker who says that cinema …<br />
Speaker 1: In my opinion cinema is one of the most important and effective forms of art nowadays. It doesn’t only entertain1 us , but it also educates us and moves our feelings.<br />
It takes us to another world, another reality.<br />
Speaker 2: Cinema was really popular last century. Today is<br />
the time of TV and the Internet. They take the biggest part of<br />
our time and interests. Cinema is the art of yesterday.<br />
Speaker 3: Cinema is international. It unites people of different nationalities and religions (). It helps to understand each other better.<br />

Speaker 4: I’m fond of cinema because it’s always different, so everyone can find something for themselves. It was invented only a century ago but today it has become the most<br />
popular entertainment all over the world.<br />
Speaker 5: I’m a cinemagoer. Well… I like watching films<br />
on TV, too. But TV films are different. They are usually for one<br />
country. Films made for cinema shows soon become international. In this way cinema helps us to learn about different<br />
countries, cultures and peoples.<br />

Speaker 6: To me, going to the cinema is the best relaxation. I’m sure that cinema makes our life better. It helps to<br />
forget about everyday problems. When we watch films, we experience a range of emotions. It’s wonderful!<br />

K ate Winslet was born on 5 October 1975, in Reading, Eng- land, in a family of actors. She started acting at the age of<br />
seven. The beginning of her career goes back to 1995 when she<br />
appeared in her first film, Heavenly Creatures. Winslet attracted more attention with<br />
her next role in Ang Lee’s film adaptation of<br />
Jane Austen’s novel, Sense and Sensibility<br />
(1995). As the charming Marianne Dashwood – the “sensibility” of the film – Winslet earned an Academy Award nomination<br />
for Best Supporting Actress.<br />
In 1997, she got the main role in the record-breaking blockbuster Titanic, which pushed her to international stardom.<br />
The film won numerous Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and scored Winslet her second Academy Award nomination for acting, this time for Best Actress. In<br />
2001, Winslet gave her voice to the animated British film,<br />
A Christmas Carol. A song from the film, “What If,” performed<br />
by Winslet became a top ten single in Britain. Her brilliant acting in the films Iris (2001), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless<br />
Mind (2004) and Little Children (2006) brought her new Academy Award nominations. She won the Best Actress Oscar for<br />
The Reader in 2008.<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа240<br />
Kate Winslet has starred in dozens of films since then. Her<br />
most famous projects of the last decade are the 2014 thriller<br />
Divergent and its 2015 sequel, Insurgent, The Mountain Between Us (2017), an adventure-survival film, and Woody Allen’s Wonder Wheel. For her performance of Joanna Hoffman<br />
in Steve Jobs (2015), she received her seventh Academy Award<br />
nomination and the European Golden Globe Award.<br />
The actress was awarded Commander of the Order of the<br />
British Empire in the 2012 Queen’s Birthday Honours List for<br />
her achievements in film and television. In 2017, Winslet<br />
teamed with Leonardo DiCaprio’s environmental foundation<br />
and took part in the campaign against global warming. Off<br />
camera, Winslet is known for her great sense of humour and<br />
care of the family. She has been married three times and has<br />

England. At the age of 18, he moved to London, where he joined the National Youth<br />
Theatre. In 1979 he decided to go to an acting school at the London Drama Centre in order to improve his acting skill. Studying six<br />

Mr Darcy in the BBC romance Pride and Prejudice. Firth’s<br />
next role was in the Academy Award-winning film The English<br />
Patient (1996). In 1998, he played brilliantly in another Oscarwinning blockbuster, Shakespeare in Love. With his appearance in 2001’s Bridget Jones’ Diary, Firth played his Mr Darcy<br />
role in a more contemporary1 setting.<br />

Lesson 8. Project ″A review of<br />
my favourite film”<br />
1a. Read the fact file and answer the question: Who do you<br />
think will like this film: children, teenagers, men, women?<br />
Fact file: The film Braveheart about the<br />
fight for Scots against the English in the late<br />
13th century, directed by Mel Gibson, won<br />
five Oscars at the 68th Academy Awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture,<br />
Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best<br />
Sound Editing (монтаж звука) and Best<br />
Makeup.<br />
1b. Listen, read the summary of the film and say who the<br />
main characters are.<br />
I n this spectacular, historic film a young Scotsman William Wallace (Mel Gibson) became a hero of his country, fighting<br />
against the aggressive rule of the English King Edward I. After the death of his father and brother, killed by English soldiers, young William was raised (воспитывался) by his uncle<br />
abroad.<br />
Years later Wallace returned to his father’s farm with<br />
an intention to lead a quiet life. He fell in love with Murron and<br />
married her but their happiness didn’t last for long. Though<br />
Wallace tried to rescue Murron from English soldiers, the aggressors caught her and killed her right in the marketplace.<br />
He decided to pay back. Wallace and a few men from his village<br />
killed the English soldiers and the sheriff and entered the fortress of the local English lord, killing him and burning the fortress down.<br />
This action was like a signal for his countrymen. They saw<br />
him as their leader to fight against the English King. In their<br />
first battle in 1297 the Scots won. Wallace became popular and<br />
more and more Scottish people followed him into the war.<br />
But William Wallace was betrayed (был предан) by the<br />
Scottish landlords, who tried to get more land for themselves<br />
from the English King, and lost the battle in 1298. Though<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа248<br />
he was saved from death by young Robert the Bruce, who later<br />
became King of Scotland Robert I, Wallace had to go into hiding for seven years and fight a guerilla war (партизанская<br />
война) against the English. His courage charmed a lot of people, including King Edward’s daughter-in-law (невестка) Princess Isabelle. At the end of the film the English caught Wallace<br />
and took him to London where he was beheaded.<br />
During the movie you see a lot of great battles and two<br />
heartbreaking love stories (first between Wallace and Murron,<br />
later in the film young princess Isabelle fell in love with Wallace). This film is a gripping story about love, hatred, patriotism and heroism. When you watch it, you understand why<br />
it won five Oscars. You can watch this movie over and over<br />
again and it never loses its magic. It is a movie which both men<br />
and women will adore: men will love the great battles and women will enjoy the love story.<br />

2a. Listen, read about unusual cinemas in the world and<br />
match the pictures with the texts.<br />
A. The Archipelago Cinema, Thailand<br />
I magine floating on a raft at sea in total darkness, with a jun- gle background and towering rocks on either side… Now<br />
place a cinema screen into this dramatic landscape, and you<br />
have the incredible1 Archipelago Cinema.<br />
Designed by German-born, Beijing-based architect Ole<br />
Scheeren, the Archipelago Cinema was created specifically for<br />
the Film On The Rocks Yao Noi Festival in Thailand.<br />
“When I saw the breathtaking beauty of the Nai Pi Lae lagoon, I thought it would be amazing if the audience would float<br />
on the ocean while watching films,” Scheeren says. Inspired<br />
by the local lobster fishermen’s rafts, Scheeren and his team<br />
created a huge floatation device made from recycled wood and<br />
mosquito nets. The audience sits on bean bags watching<br />
an enormous screen that’s fixed to the ocean floor.<br />
B. Event Cornwall Outdoor Screenings, UK<br />
E vent Cornwall annually hosts outdoor screenings of water- themed films on the King Henry ferry2 as part of the Fal<br />
River Festival. This year’s event started with the screening<br />
of Jaws. “During that film, there was a fisherman’s boat that<br />
circled the ferry with one light on, which added to the scary<br />

Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа251<br />
atmosphere,” an Event Cornwall spokesperson said. “Likewise,<br />
for a screening of The Perfect Storm, it poured with rain. It’s<br />
like a 4D cinematic experience.”<br />
Event Cornwall has also organised screenings of The Blair<br />
Witch Project and Friday The 13th. For these films the location<br />
was chosen in the wooded Tehidy Country Park. “There was<br />
a moment in Friday The 13th where there was a chase1 through<br />
the woods, and you couldn’t see where the screen stopped and<br />
the woods started,” the spokesperson added.<br />
C. CGV Cheongdam Cine City, Seoul, South Korea<br />
T his cinema takes the viewing experience to the next level with moving seats, special lighting, wind, fog and even<br />
scent2-based effects to make you feel immersed3 in the film.<br />
For a screening of Titanic, the audience got to “go down with<br />
the ship”, mist was created, and sea scented water was sprayed.<br />
This 4D gripping experience aims to “free” the filmgoers by placing them into the shoes of the hero by feeling what he feels.<br />
Sitting through amusement-park-type effects for such<br />
a long time may not be suitable for everyone, so this cinema<br />
is not a good choice for people with heart disease, back pains<br />
and children under one metre.<br />
D. Staircase Cinema, Auckland, New Zealand<br />
T he Stairway Cinema was built in 2012 on an outdoor stair- case in a busy place with a lot of bus stops. This small, comfortable cinema is located on the steps of the staircase, used<br />
as seats for about 7 people. Passers-by can step inside for a few<br />
minutes and watch a short film while waiting for their bus<br />
or laundry4.<br />
Its creators said about their project: “Our aim is to experiment with architecture and the way it can interact5 with the<br />
public in unique and exciting ways. This project takes inspiration from the site and its inhabitants. The intersection of Symonds Street and Mount Street is a place of ‘hard waiting’<br />
with bus stops and laundromats, which make the staircase cinema a great spot for social interaction.”<br />

Lesson 4. Comparisons with as … as /<br />
Сравнительные предложения с as … as<br />
Помимо прилагательных в сравнительной и превосходной степени для сравнения предметов можно употреблять<br />
пред ложения со сравнительной конструкцией as adjective<br />
as, которая означает:<br />
1) такой же как / не такой как:<br />
+ Their house is as big as ours.<br />
– Their garden is not as big as ours.<br />
? Is your garden as big as theirs?<br />
В отрицательных предложениях может употребляться<br />
not so adjective as:<br />
– Their garden is not so big as ours.<br />
2) значительную разницу (в разы) между сравниваемыми<br />
предметами, объектами:<br />
Greenland is ten times as large as Great Britain. Greenland<br />
is ten times larger than Great Britain.<br />
Lesson 5. Modal verb ought (to) / Модальный<br />
глагол ought (to)<br />
Модальный глагол ought (to), как и should, выражает<br />
совет, но более настойчивый. После ought употребляется<br />
ин финитив с частицей to:<br />
+ He ought to go there now.<br />
– He ought not to go there now.<br />
? Ought he to go there now?<br />
В современном английском языке модальный глагол<br />
should употребляется значительно чаще.<br />
UNIT 2<br />
Lesson 5. Modal verb need / Модальный глагол need<br />
Модальный глагол need + Infinitive выражает необходимость совершить действия только в отрицательных<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа254<br />
и вопро сительных предложениях, в то время как must + Infinitive употребляется только в утвердительных и вопросительных предложениях. В вопросительных предложениях<br />
must и need являются синонимами, передавая значение<br />
необходи мости:<br />
Must I go there now? Need I go there now?<br />
Отрицательная форма needn’t выражает отсутствие необходимости совершить действие, т.е. является противоположной по значению глаголу must, который выражает<br />
запрещение:<br />
You needn’t come early. – Тебе не нужно приходить рано.<br />
You mustn’t come early. – Тебе нельзя приходить рано.<br />
В утвердительном ответе на вопрос с глаголом need употребляется must, в отрицательном ответе на вопрос с глаголом must употребляется needn’t:<br />
Need we do the whole exercise? – Yes, you must.<br />
Must they come early? – No, they needn’t.<br />
Чаще всего глагол need употребляется как смысловой<br />
гла гол, а не как модальный. В этом случае он образует<br />
времен ные формы так же, как другие смысловые глаголы:<br />
+ I need to go now.<br />
– I don’t need to go now.<br />
? Do you need to go now?<br />
Lesson 6. Infinitive or gerund / Употребление<br />
инфинитива или герундия<br />
Инфинитив представляет собой неличную глагольную<br />
форму (неопределённая форма глагола), не имеющую ка тего рии лица и числа. В предложениях часто встречается после некоторых основных или модальных глаголов с частицей to или без неё.<br />
Verb + to-infinitive: want to, need to, would like to, ask<br />
smb to, tell smb to, advise smb to, recommend smb to.<br />
Modal verb + to-infinitive: have to, ought to.<br />
Modal verb + infinitive: can do, must do, may do, needn’t do.<br />
Герундий – неличная глагольная форма, образуемая<br />
с помощью -ing. Употребляется после некоторых глаголов:<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа255<br />
like / love / dislike / hate / can’t stand doing smth; после<br />
прилагательных с предлогами: be fond of / interested in /<br />
afraid of / good at / bad at doing smth.<br />
Lesson 6. Adjective + preposition /<br />
Прилагательное + предлог<br />
Прилагательные часто употребляются с предлогами,<br />
например: about, at, by, for, from, in, of, to, with. Общего<br />
правила употребления предлогов с прилагательными не<br />
существует, поэтому надо запомнить предлог, с которым<br />
употребляется прила гатель ное. (Смотрите список прилагательных с предлогами в электронном приложении.)<br />

Lesson 2. Articles / Артикли<br />
Cуществительные, обозначающие прием пищи, не имеют ар тикля, если они употреблены в своём абстрактном значении, просто называют ту или иную трапезу и ассоциируются со временем приёма пищи: to have (take, serve, cook,<br />
prepare) bre akfast, lunch, dinner, tea.<br />
Lunch is at 12 o’clock. What shall I cook for dinner?<br />
Неопределённый артикль употребляется, если у существительного есть описательное определение:<br />
There is no such thing as a free lunch. A potluck dinner is a<br />
dinner when everyone has to bring a dish.<br />
Определённый артикль употребляется с данными существительными, если имеется в виду сама еда:<br />
The dinner you cooked was great! How much did you pay for<br />
the lunch?<br />
Lesson 3. Quantifiers / Указатели количества<br />

Lesson 6. Reflexive pronouns / Возвратные<br />
местоимения<br />
В английском языке нет возвратного местоимения<br />
себя. Для обозначения перехода действия на само лицо<br />
употребляются восемь возвратных местоимений, оканчиваю щихся на -self (-selves во множественном числе):<br />
I – myself, you – yourself, he – himself, she – herself, it –<br />
itself, we – ourselves, you – yourselves, they – themselves<br />
На русский язык они переводятся глаголом с постфиксом<br />
“-ся (-сь)” или местоимением “себя” (“себе”, “собой”, “сам”):<br />
They talked about themselves. – Они говорили о себе.<br />
I can take care of myself. – Я могу позаботиться о себе сам.<br />
UNIT 4<br />
Lesson 2. Present Perfect or Present Perfect Continuous<br />
Present Perfect означает прошлое действие, завер шившееся к настоящему моменту, так что результат этого действия очевиден:<br />
The teacher told us to read four books. I have already read<br />
two (How many?). I have eaten half a bowl of soup (How<br />
much?), but I can’t eat any more.<br />
I / You / We / They have (not) V3<br />
He / She / It has (not) V3<br />
Рresent Perfect Continuous означает действие, начавшееся в прошлом и длящееся до настоящего момента:<br />

A: What are you doing? – B: I’m cooking dinner. A: How<br />
long have you been cooking? – B: I’ve been cooking for three<br />
hours already.<br />
I / You / We / They have (not) been Ving<br />
He / She / It has (not) been Ving<br />
Lesson 4. Определённый артикль<br />
с субстантивированными прилагательными<br />
Субстантивированные прилагательные выполняют роль<br />
существительного. Как правило, они называют определённый класс людей и употребляются с определённым артиклем:<br />
the blind (people who cannot see), the young, the old, the rich,<br />
the poor. Например, The rich used to give presents to the poor<br />
on 26th December. ‘The rich’ можно заменить словосочета нием<br />
‘rich people’.<br />
UNIT 5<br />
Lesson 1. Past Simple Passive<br />
Past Simple Passive употребляется, если настоящий исполнитель прошлого действия неизвестен или его не хотят<br />
называть. Сравните: The Bank Holidays Act was introduced<br />
in 1871. Подлежащее предложения The Bank Holidays Act<br />
не выполняет действие, оно пассивно.<br />
В Past Simple Passive используются те же указатели времени, что и в Past Simple Active: yesterday, … ago, last …,<br />
in 1871.<br />
+(–) I / He / She / It was (not) V3 …<br />
We / You / They were (not) V3 …<br />
? Was I / he / she / it V3 … ?<br />
Were we / you / they V3 …?<br />

UNIT 6<br />
Lesson 1. The article a in set expressions / Артикль a<br />
в устойчивых выражениях<br />
Употребление артиклей в английском языке не всегда<br />
подчиняется правилам. Есть ряд словосочетаний с неоп ределённым артиклем a, которые нужно запомнить, чтобы не<br />
допускать ошибок:<br />
a lot of (+ countable or uncountable noun in statements) –<br />
много: We usually give and get a lot of presents at New Year.<br />
My brother earns a lot of money.<br />
a few (+ countable noun) – несколько: There are a few sandwiches in the fridge. You can eat them.<br />
a good / great deal (+ uncountable noun) – множество:<br />
A great deal of time was simply wasted.<br />
a great many (+ countable noun) – большое количество,<br />
очень много: We’ve been friends for a great many years.<br />
a (great / large) number of (+ countable noun) – ряд,<br />
много: A large number of people have lost their jobs recently.<br />
a little (+ uncountable noun) – немного: Have a little water<br />
to rinse down the sandwiches.<br />
at a speed of – со скоростью<br />
at a time – за один раз<br />
as a result – в результате, в итоге<br />
as a rule – обычно, как правило<br />
it is a pleasure (to / clause) – удовольствие: It’s a pleasure<br />
to meet you. It’s a pleasure that we have met here.<br />
it is a shame (to / clause) – стыдно<br />
to go for a walk – идти на прогулку<br />
to have a good time – веселиться / хорошо проводить<br />
время<br />
to have a cold – быть простуженным<br />
to have a look – посмотреть<br />
to have a rest – отдохнуть<br />
to take a seat – сесть<br />
in a low / loud voice – тихо, громко<br />
to tell a lie – лгать<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа259<br />
Lesson 2. Past Perfect<br />
Past Perfect употребляется для выражения про шедшего<br />
действия, которое:<br />
1) закончилось до другого дей ствия в прошлом:<br />
At home she saw that somebody had eaten all her chocolates.<br />
2) завершилось к определённому моменту в прошлом,<br />
ука занному обстоятельством времени с предлогом by:<br />
By four o’clock they had finished their preparation for the<br />
party.<br />
+(–) I / You / He / She / It / We / They had (not) V3 …<br />
? Had I / you / he / she / it / we / they V3 …?<br />
Future Simple-in-the-Past употребляется для выражения<br />
будущего действия, рассматриваемого с позиций прош лого:<br />
I think (Present Simple) I won’t win (Future Simple) because<br />
that will be unfair to women. I thought (Past Simple) I wouldn’t<br />
win (Future Simple-in-the-Past) because that would be unfair<br />
to women.<br />
Для образования Future Simple-in-the-Past необходимо<br />
вспомогательный глагол will, используемый в Future Simple,<br />
заменить на would.<br />
+(–) I / You / He / She / It / We / They would (not) V …<br />
? Would I / you / he / she / it / we / they V …?<br />
Lesson 2. Object clauses / Придаточные<br />
дополнительные предложения<br />
Сложные предложения состоят из главного и придаточного предложений. Придаточные предложения могут<br />
относиться к любому члену предложения: подлежащему,<br />
сказуемому или дополнению.<br />
Придаточные дополнительные предложения в составе<br />
сложноподчинённого предложения выполняют функцию<br />
дополнения – следуют за глаголом и отвечают на вопросы:<br />
What? (Что?); About what? (О чём?):<br />
I don’t know (don’t know what?) why they chose that house.<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа260<br />
I understand (understand what?) whose idea it was.<br />
Have you agreed (agreed about what?) on what we should do<br />
next?<br />
He explained (explained what?) when / how / with whom<br />
we will go there.<br />
She is not sure (not sure about what?) whether she wants to<br />
take part in the contest or not.<br />
Придаточные дополнительные предложения присоединяются к главному предложению с помощью следующих<br />
союзов: that – что; what – что; who, whom – кто, кого / кому;<br />
whose – чей / чья / чьё / чьи; whether, if – ли; what (book) –<br />
какая (книга); which (book) – которая (книга); when – когда;<br />
where – где; why – почему; how – как.<br />
Союз that в предложении можно опустить:<br />
She said that she could help me with homework. – She said<br />
she could help me with homework.<br />
Lesson 3. Sequence of Tenses / Согласование времён<br />
Употребление времени глагола-сказуемого в придаточном дополнительном предложении зависит от времени глагола-сказуемого главного предложения. Данное правило называется правилом согласования времён в английском языке.<br />
Если глагол главного предложения стоит в настоящем<br />
или будущем времени, то глагол в придаточном предложении может стоять в любом времени в зависимости от смысла.<br />
Если глагол в главном предложении стоит в прошедшем<br />
времени, то глагол-сказуемое придаточного дополнительного<br />
пред ложения может быть употреблён только в прошедшем<br />
времени.<br />
В придаточном предложении происходит сдвиг времён<br />
в прошлое следующим образом:<br />
Present Simple → Past Simple,<br />
Present Continuous → Past Continuous,<br />
Present Perfect → Past Perfect,<br />
Past Simple → Past Perfect,<br />
Future Simple → Future Simple-in-the-Past.<br />
Изменяются также наречия времени и места и указательные местоимения:<br />
now – then, last … – the … before,<br />
Правообладатель Вышэйшая школа261<br />
today – that day, next … – the following …,<br />
yesterday – the day before, here – there,<br />
tomorrow – the next day, this – that,<br />
… ago – … before, these – those.<br />
UNIT 7<br />
Lesson 2. Article with musical instruments / Артикль<br />
с названиями музыкальных инструментов<br />
Определённый артикль употребляется в словосочетании<br />
play + the + musical instrument: play the guitar. Артикль а<br />
или the употребляется по общему правилу, если имеется в<br />
виду музыкальный инструмент как предмет:<br />
Can you put the guitar in your room? It’s in the way.<br />
For our group we need a piano, a guitar and a violin.<br />
Lesson 3. Order of adjectives / Порядок<br />
прилагательных<br />
Если перед существительным есть несколько прилагательных, то они располагаются в следующем порядке:<br />
opi nion + size + age + colour + NOUN.<br />
A beautiful big old green drum.<br />
UNIT 8<br />
Lesson 2. Participle I (-ing) and Participle II (-ed) /<br />
Действительное и страдательное причастия<br />
Действительное и страдательное причастия образуются<br />
от глагола с помощью суффиксов -ing и -ed. В предложении<br />
они употребляются в функции определения. Действительные причастия выражают качества предмета или человека:<br />
This is an interesting book. He is an interesting person.<br />
Страдательные причастия выражают состояние человека<br />
или предмета:<br />
Hе is / looks / feels interested.<br />
The book is illustrated.<br />

Lesson 3. Relative pronouns / Относительные<br />
местоимения<br />
Относительные местоимения who (кто), whom (кого), whose<br />
(чей), what (что, какой), which (который, какой, кто, что) связывают главные предложения с придаточными. В предложении они являются подлежащими или дополне ниями:<br />
The man who (подлежащее) is sitting next to you is my<br />
teacher.<br />
It is not what (дополнение) I want.<br />
Who употребляется по отношению к людям и является<br />
в предложении подлежащим. Whom также употребляется<br />
по отношению к людям, но является дополнением:<br />
This is the man whom we saw in the park yesterday.<br />
Which относится к неодушевлённым предметам и животным и может быть как подлежащим, так и дополнением:<br />
The books which (подлежащее) are on the table are yours.<br />
He showed me the photo of the kitten which (дополнение)<br />
he had found in the street.<br />
Если речь идёт о выборе среди нескольких людей или<br />
предметов, употребляется местоименение which (выбор из<br />
ограниченного числа возможных вариантов):<br />
Which of the three writers do you prefer?<br />
Which of the dishes is your favourite?<br />
Иногда which относится не к одному слову, а к предложению в целом, которое отделяется запятой:<br />
He offered to help, which is very kind of him.<br />
Whose употребляется по отношению к людям:<br />
This is the woman whose brother is a famous writer.<br />
Whose, однако, может иногда относиться к неодушевлённым предметам, заменяя оборот of which:<br />
We saw a mountain whose top (= the top of which) was<br />
covered with forest.<br />
