<h2 id="top-of-the-world">Top of the World</h2>
<p>Such a feelin's coming over me</p>
<p>There is wonder in most every thing I see</p>
<p>Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes</p>
<p>And I won't be surprised if it's a dream</p>
<p>Everything I want the world to be</p>
<p>Is now coming true especially for me</p>
<p>And the reason is clear, it's because you are here</p>
<p>You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen</p>
<p>I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation</p>
<p>And the only explanation I can find</p>
<p>Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around</p>
<p>Your love's put me at the top of the world</p>
<p>Something in the wind has learned my name</p>
<p>And it's telling me that things are not the same</p>
<p>In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze</p>
<p>There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me</p>
<p>There is only one wish on my mind</p>
<p>When this day is through I hope that I will find</p>
<p>That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me</p>
<p>All I need will be mine if you are here</p></body>
