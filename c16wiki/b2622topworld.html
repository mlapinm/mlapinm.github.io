<h2 id="top-of-the-world">Top of the World</h2>
<p>Such a feelin's coming over me<br />
There is wonder in most every thing I see<br />
Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes<br />
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream  </p>
<p>Everything I want the world to be<br />
Is now coming true especially for me<br />
And the reason is clear, it's because you are here<br />
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen  </p>
<p>I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation<br />
And the only explanation I can find<br />
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around<br />
Your love's put me at the top of the world  </p>
<p>Something in the wind has learned my name<br />
And it's telling me that things are not the same<br />
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze<br />
There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me  </p>
<p>There is only one wish on my mind<br />
When this day is through I hope that I will find<br />
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me<br />
All I need will be mine if you are here  </p>
