<p>[Intro: Puff Daddy]<br />
Yeah, this right here (Tell me why)<br />
Goes out to everyone that has lost someone<br />
That they truly loved (C'mon, check it out)  </p>
<p>[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]<br />
Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show<br />
I laced the track, you locked the flow<br />
So far from hangin' on the block for dough<br />
Notorious, they got to know that<br />
Life ain't always what it seem to be<br />
Words can't express what you mean to me<br />
Even though you're gone, we still a team<br />
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)<br />
In the future, can't wait to see<br />
If you open up the gates for me<br />
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend<br />
Try to black it out, but it plays again<br />
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal<br />
Can't imagine all the pain I feel<br />
Give anythin' to hear half your breath (Half your breath)<br />
I know you still livin' your life after death<br />
[Chorus: Faith Evans &amp; Puff Daddy]<br />
Every step I take, every move I make<br />
Every single day, every time I pray<br />
I'll be missin' you<br />
Thinkin' of the day when you went away<br />
What a life to take, what a bond to break<br />
I'll be missin' you<br />
(I miss you, B.I.G.)  </p>
<p>[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]<br />
It's kinda hard with you not around (Yeah)<br />
Know you in heaven, smilin' down (Ha)<br />
Watchin' us while we pray for you<br />
Every day we pray for you<br />
'Til the day we meet again<br />
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend<br />
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed<br />
Strength I need to believe<br />
My thoughts Big I just can't define (Can't define)<br />
Wish I could turn back the hands of time<br />
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks<br />
You and me takin' flicks<br />
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on<br />
Still can't believe you're gone (Can't believe you're gone)<br />
Give anything to hear half your breath (Half your breath)<br />
I know you still livin' your life after death<br />
[Chorus: Faith Evans]<br />
Every step I take, every move I make (I miss you)<br />
Every single day, every time I pray<br />
I'll be missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)<br />
Thinkin' of the day when you went away<br />
What a life to take, what a bond to break<br />
I'll be missin' you  </p>
<p>[Interlude: Faith Evans]<br />
Somebody tell me why<br />
One glad morning<br />
When this life is over<br />
I know I'll see your face  </p>
<p>[Bridge: 112 &amp; Puff Daddy]<br />
Every night I pray, every step I take<br />
Every move I make, every single day<br />
Every night I pray, every step I take<br />
Every day that passes<br />
Is a day that I get closer<br />
Every move I make, every single day<br />
To seeing you again<br />
We miss you B.I.G<br />
Every night I pray, every step I take<br />
And we won't stop<br />
'Cause we can't stop<br />
Every move I make, every single day<br />
That's right<br />
Every night I pray, every step I take<br />
Every move I make, every single day<br />
We miss you B.I.G<br />
[Chorus: Faith Evans]<br />
Every step I take, every move I make (I miss you)<br />
Every single day, every time I pray<br />
I'll be missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)<br />
Thinkin' of the day when you went away<br />
What a life to take, what a bond to break<br />
I'll be missin' you (We miss you)<br />
Every step I take, every move I make<br />
Every single day, every time I pray<br />
I'll be missin' you (I'll be missin' you)<br />
Thinkin' of the day (Thinkin' of the day) when you went away<br />
What a life to take, what a bond to break<br />
I'll be missin' you (We miss you)  </p>

<p>[Refrain]<br />
So close, no matter how far<br />
Couldn't be much more from the heart<br />
Forever trusting who we are<br />
And nothing else matters  </p>
<p>[Verse]<br />
Never opened myself this way<br />
Life is ours, we live it our way<br />
All these words, I don't just say<br />
And nothing else matters<br />
Trust I seek and I find in you<br />
Every day for us something new<br />
Open mind for a different view<br />
And nothing else matters  </p>
<p>[Chorus]<br />
Never cared for what they do<br />
Never cared for what they know<br />
But I know  </p>

<h2 id="the-rembrandts-ill-be-there-for-you">The Rembrandts - I'll be There For You</h2>
<p>So no one told you life was gonna be this way<br />
Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A.<br />
It's like you're always stuck in second gear<br />
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year, but  </p>
<p>[Chorus]<br />
I'll be there for you<br />
(When the rain starts to pour)<br />
I'll be there for you<br />
(Like I've been there before)<br />
I'll be there for you<br />
('Cause you're there for me too)  </p>
<p>You're still in bed at ten and work began at eight<br />
You've burned your breakfast so far, things are going great<br />
Your mother warned you there'd be days like these<br />
But she didn't tell when the world has brought you down to your knees  </p>
<p>[Chorus]  </p>
<p>No one could ever know me, no onecould ever see me<br />
Seems you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me<br />
Someone to face the day with, make it through all the rest with<br />
Someone I'll always laugh with<br />
Even at my worst, I'm best with you, yeah!  </p>
<p>It's like you're always stuck in second gear<br />
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year, but  </p>

<p>[Chorus: Sting]<br />
I dream of rain, ya leil, ya leil<br />
I dream of gardens in the desert sand<br />
I wake in vain, ya leil, ya leil<br />
I dream of love as time runs through my hand  </p>
<p>[Post-Chorus: Sting]<br />
I dream of rain, ya leil, ya leil<br />
I lift my gaze to empty skies above<br />
I close my eyes, ya leil, ya leil<br />
This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love  </p>
<p>[Bridge: Cheb Mami]<br />
Aman, aman, aman<br />
Omry feek antia<br />
Ma ghair antia<br />
Ma ghair antia  </p>
<p>[Chorus: Sting]<br />
I dream of rain, ya leil, ya leil<br />
I dream of gardens in the desert sand<br />
I wake in vain, ya leil, ya leil<br />
I dream of love as time runs through my hand  </p>
<p>[Verse 2: Sting]<br />
Sweet desert rose, ya leil, ya leil<br />
Each of her veils, a secret promise<br />
This desert flower, ya leil, ya leil<br />
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this<br />
Sweet desert rose<br />
This memory of Eden haunts us all<br />
This desert flower, ya leil, ya leil<br />
This rare perfume, is the sweet intoxication of the fall  </p>

<p>[Verse 1]<br />
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go<br />
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show<br />
You're givin' me a million reasons<br />
Give me a million reasons<br />
Givin' me a million reasons<br />
About a million reasons  </p>
<p>If I had a highway, I would run for the hills<br />
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still<br />
But you're giving me a million reasons<br />
Give me a million reasons<br />
Givin' me a million reasons<br />
About a million reasons  </p>
<p>[Chorus]<br />
I bow down to pray<br />
I try to make the worst seem better<br />
Lord, show me the way<br />
To cut through all his worn out leather<br />
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away<br />
But baby, I just need one good one to stay  </p>
<p>[Verse 2]<br />
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare<br />
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware<br />
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons<br />
Give me a million reasons<br />
Givin' me a million reasons<br />
About a million reasons<br />
And if you say something that you might even mean<br />
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe<br />
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons<br />
Give me a million reasons<br />
Givin' me a million reasons<br />
About a million reasons  </p>
<p>[Chorus]<br />
I bow down to pray<br />
I try to make the worst seem better<br />
Lord, show me the way<br />
To cut through all his worn out leather<br />
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away<br />
But baby, I just need one good one to stay  </p>
<p>[Bridge]<br />
Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy<br />
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'<br />
Stay, ehh, ehhy<br />
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'<br />
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith<br />
But baby, I just need one good one<br />
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one  </p>
<p>[Chorus]<br />
When I bow down to pray<br />
I try to make the worst seem better<br />
Lord, show me the way<br />
To cut through all his worn out leather<br />
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away<br />
But baby, I just need one good one, good one<br />
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one<br />
Baby, I just need one good one to stay  </p>

<p>[Verse 1: The Weeknd]<br />
I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)<br />
You look so happy when I'm not with you<br />
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise<br />
A single teardrop falling from your eye  </p>
<p>[Refrain: The Weeknd &amp; Ariana Grande]<br />
I don't know why I run away (Oh)<br />
I make you cry when I run away (Oh)  </p>
<p>[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]<br />
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay<br />
Save your tears for another  </p>
<p>[Chorus: The Weeknd &amp; Ariana Grande]<br />
Save your tears for another day (Oh)<br />
Save your tears for another day (Mm)  </p>
<p>[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]<br />
Met you once under a Pisces moon<br />
I kept my distance 'cause I know that you<br />
Don't like when I'm with nobody else<br />
I couldn't help it, I put you through hell  </p>
<p>[Refrain: Ariana Grande]<br />
I don't know why I run away, oh boy (Run away, oh yeah; oh)<br />
I make you cry when I run away (Away, oh; oh)  </p>
<p>[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]<br />
Boy, take me back 'cause I wanna stay<br />
Save your tears for another<br />
I realize that it's much too late<br />
And you deserve someone better  </p>
<p>[Chorus: Ariana Grande]<br />
Save your tears for another day (Oh)<br />
Save your tears for another day (Oh)  </p>
<p>[Refrain: Both, Ariana Grande]<br />
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)<br />
I don't know why I run away (Oh)<br />

I make you cry when I run away (Save)  </p>

Save your tears for another day (Oh)<br />
Save your tears for another day (Oh)<br />
Save your tears for another day  </p>

<p>[Verse 1]<br />
Listen as your day unfolds<br />
Challenge what the future holds<br />
Try and keep your head up to the sky<br />
Lovers, they may cause you tears<br />
Go ahead, release your fears<br />
Stand up and be counted<br />
Don't be 'shamed to cry<br />
You gotta be  </p>
<p>[Chorus]<br />
You gotta be bad<br />
You gotta be bold<br />
You gotta be wiser<br />
You gotta be hard<br />
You gotta be tough<br />
You gotta be stronger<br />
You gotta be cool<br />
You gotta be calm<br />
You gotta stay together<br />
All I know, all I know<br />
Love will save the day  </p>
<p>[Verse 2]<br />
Herald what your mother said<br />
Read the books your father read<br />
Try to solve the puzzles in your own sweet time<br />
Some may have more cash than you<br />
Others take a different view<br />
My, oh my, hey, hey  </p>

<p>[Verse 1]<br />
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me<br />
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy<br />
I need somebody to hear, somebody to know<br />
Somebody to have, somebody to hold<br />
It's easy to say, but it's never the same<br />
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain  </p>
<p>[Chorus]<br />
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall<br />
And you're not here to get me through it all<br />
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug<br />
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved  </p>
<p>[Verse 2]<br />
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to<br />
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you<br />
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear<br />
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels<br />
It's easy to say, but it's never the same<br />
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape  </p>

<p>[Verse 1]<br />
Come and hold my hand<br />
I wanna contact the living<br />
Not sure I understand<br />
This role I've been given<br />
I sit and talk to God<br />
And he just laughs at my plans<br />
My head speaks a language<br />
I don't understand  </p>
<p>[Chorus]<br />
I just wanna feel real love<br />
Fill the home that I live in<br />
'Cause I got too much life<br />
Running through my veins<br />
Going to waste  </p>
<p>[Verse 2]<br />
I don't wanna die<br />
But I ain't keen on living either<br />
Before I fall in love<br />
I'm preparing to leave her<br />
Scare myself to death<br />
That's why I keep on running<br />
Before I've arrived<br />
I can see myself coming  </p>

<p>[Verse 1]<br />
Oh, it seemed forever stopped today<br />
All the lonely hearts in London<br />
Caught a plane and flew away<br />
And all the best women are married<br />
All the handsome men are gay<br />
You feel deprived<br />
Yeah, are you questioning your size?<br />
Is there a tumour in your humour?<br />
Are there bags under your eyes?<br />
Do you leave dents where you sit?<br />
Are you getting on a bit?<br />
Will you survive?<br />
You must survive  </p>
<p>[Chorus]<br />
When there's no love in town<br />
This new century keeps bringing you down<br />
All the places you have been<br />
Trying to find a love supreme<br />
A love supreme  </p>
<p>[Verse 2]<br />
Oh, what are you really looking for?<br />
Another partner in your life<br />
To abuse and to adore?<br />
Is it lovey dovey stuff?<br />
Do you need a bit of rough?<br />
Get on your knees<br />
Yeah, turn down the love songs that you hear<br />
'Cause you can't avoid the sentiment<br />
That echoes in your ear<br />
Saying love will stop the pain<br />
Saying love will kill the fear<br />
Do you believe?<br />
You must believe  </p>

Somewhere after midnight in my wildest fantasy<br />
Somewhere just beyond my reach, there's someone reaching back for me<br />
Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat<br />
It's gonna take a Superman to sweep me off my feet, yeah  </p>

Up where the mountains meet the heavens above<br />
Out where the lightning splits the sea<br />
I could swear there is someone somewhere watching me<br />
Through the wind and the chill and the rain<br />
And the storm and the flood<br />
I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood<br />
(Like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my blood)<br />
(Like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my blood, blood)<br />

<p>[Verse 1]<br />
Tell her I'll be waiting<br />
In the usual place<br />
With the tired and weary<br />
And there's no escape<br />
To need a woman<br />
You've got to know<br />
How the strong get weak<br />
And the rich get poor  </p>
<p>[Chorus]<br />
Slave to love<br />
Oh, oh, slave to love  </p>
<p>[Verse 2]<br />
You're running with me<br />
Don't touch the ground<br />
We're the restless hearted<br />
Not the chained and bound<br />
The sky is burning<br />
A sea of flame<br />
Though your world is changing<br />
I will be the same  </p>
<p>[Chorus]<br />
Slave to love<br />
Oh oh, slave to love<br />
Slave to love<br />
Na na na na, na na na na<br />
And I can't escape, I'm a slave to love<br />

<p>[Verse 1: Agnetha Fältskog]<br />
I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through<br />
Though it's hurting me, now it's history<br />
I've played all my cards<br />
And that's what you've done, too<br />
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play  </p>
<p>[Chorus: Agnetha Fältskog]<br />
The winner takes it all<br />
The loser standing small<br />
Beside the victory<br />
That's her destiny  </p>
<p>[Verse 2: Agnetha Fältskog]<br />
I was in your arms, thinkin' I belonged there<br />
I figured it made sense building me a fence<br />
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there<br />
But I was a fool playing by the rules  </p>
<p>[Chorus: Agnetha Fältskog &amp; Anni-Frid Lingstad]<br />
The gods may throw a dice<br />
Their minds as cold as ice<br />
And someone way down here<br />
Loses someone dear<br />
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)<br />
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)<br />
It's simple and it's plain (Yes, it's plain)<br />
Why should I complain? (Why complain?)<br />

But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you?<br />
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?<br />
Somewhere deep inside, you must know I miss you<br />
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed  </p>

The judges will decide (They decide)<br />
The likes of me abide (We abide)<br />
Spectators of the show (Of the show)<br />
Always stayin' low (Staying low)<br />
The game is on again (On again)<br />
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)<br />
A big thing or a small (Big or small)<br />
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)  </p>
<p>[Bridge: Agnetha Fältskog]<br />
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad<br />
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand<br />
I apologise if it makes you feel bad<br />
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence<br />
But you see, the winner takes it all<br />
The winner takes it all  </p>

(So the winner takes it all)<br />
(And the loser has to fall)<br />

<p>[Verse 1]<br />
Well, I'm standing by a river<br />
But the water doesn't flow<br />
It boils with every poison you can think of<br />
And I'm underneath the streetlights<br />
But the light of joy I know<br />
Scared beyond belief way down in the shadows<br />
And the perverted fear of violence<br />
Chokes a smile on every face<br />
And common sense is ringing out the bells<br />
This ain't no technological breakdown<br />
Oh no, this is the road to Hell  </p>
<p>[Guitar Solo]  </p>
<p>[Verse 2]<br />
And all the roads jam up with credit<br />
And there's nothing you can do<br />
It's all just bits of paper<br />
Flying away from you<br />
Oh, look out world take a good look<br />
What comes down here<br />
You must learn this lesson fast<br />
And learn it well<br />
This ain't no upwardly mobile freeway<br />
Oh no, this is the road<br />
Said this is the road<br />
This is the road to Hell  </p>

<p>There is only one wish on my mind<br />
When this day is through I hope that I will find<br />
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me<br />
All I need will be mine if you are here  </p>

<h2 id="the-sound-of-silence">The Sound of Silence</h2>
<p>Hello, darkness, my old friend,<br />
I've come to talk with you again<br />
Because a vision softly creeping,<br />
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,<br />
And the vision that was planted in my brain<br />
Still remains<br />
Within the sound of silence.  </p>
<p>In restless dreams I walked alone,<br />
Narrow streets of cobblestone,<br />
Neath the halo of a streetlamp,<br />
I turned my collar to the cold and damp,<br />
When my eyes were stabbed<br />
By the flash of the neon light,<br />
And split the night,<br />
And touched the sound of silence.  </p>
<p>And in the naked light I saw<br />
Ten thousand people, maybe more.<br />
People talking without speaking,<br />
People hearing without listening,<br />
People writing songs that voices never shared,<br />
And no one dared to stir the sound of silence.  </p>
<p>Fools, said I, you don't know,<br />
Silence like a cancer grows.<br />
Hear my words and I might teach you,<br />
Take my arms and I might reach you,<br />
But my words like silent raindrops fell,<br />
And echoed<br />
In the wells of silence.  </p>
<p>And the people bowed and prayed<br />
To the neon god they'd made,<br />
And the sign flashed its warning<br />
In the words that it was forming,<br />
And the sign sayed the words of the prophets are written<br />
On the subway walls and tenement halls,<br />
And whispered in the sound of silence.  </p>
