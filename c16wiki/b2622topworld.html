<h2 id="top-of-the-world">Top of the World</h2>
<p>Such a feelin's coming over me<br />
There is wonder in most every thing I see<br />
Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes<br />
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream  </p>
<p>Everything I want the world to be<br />
Is now coming true especially for me<br />
And the reason is clear, it's because you are here<br />
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen  </p>
<p>I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation<br />
And the only explanation I can find<br />
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around<br />
Your love's put me at the top of the world  </p>
<p>Something in the wind has learned my name<br />
And it's telling me that things are not the same<br />
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze<br />
There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me  </p>
<p>There is only one wish on my mind<br />
When this day is through I hope that I will find<br />
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me<br />
All I need will be mine if you are here  </p>

<h2 id="the-sound-of-silence">The Sound of Silence</h2>
<p>Hello, darkness, my old friend,<br />
I've come to talk with you again<br />
Because a vision softly creeping,<br />
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,<br />
And the vision that was planted in my brain<br />
Still remains<br />
Within the sound of silence.  </p>
<p>In restless dreams I walked alone,<br />
Narrow streets of cobblestone,<br />
Neath the halo of a streetlamp,<br />
I turned my collar to the cold and damp,<br />
When my eyes were stabbed<br />
By the flash of the neon light,<br />
And split the night,<br />
And touched the sound of silence.  </p>
<p>And in the naked light I saw<br />
Ten thousand people, maybe more.<br />
People talking without speaking,<br />
People hearing without listening,<br />
People writing songs that voices never shared,<br />
And no one dared to stir the sound of silence.  </p>
<p>Fools, said I, you don't know,<br />
Silence like a cancer grows.<br />
Hear my words and I might teach you,<br />
Take my arms and I might reach you,<br />
But my words like silent raindrops fell,<br />
And echoed<br />
In the wells of silence.  </p>
<p>And the people bowed and prayed<br />
To the neon god they'd made,<br />
And the sign flashed its warning<br />
In the words that it was forming,<br />
And the sign sayed the words of the prophets are written<br />
On the subway walls and tenement halls,<br />
And whispered in the sound of silence.  </p>
