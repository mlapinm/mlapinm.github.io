<p>[Verse 1]<br />
Where have all the good men gone and where are all the gods?<br />
Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the risin' odds?<br />
Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?<br />
Late at night, I toss and I turn and I dream of what I need  </p>
<p>[Chorus]<br />
I need a hero<br />
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night<br />
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast<br />
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight<br />
I need a hero (Hero)<br />
I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light (Hero till the morning light)<br />
He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon<br />
And he's gotta be larger than life, larger than life  </p>
<p>[Post-Chorus]<br />

[Verse 2]<br />
Somewhere after midnight in my wildest fantasy<br />
Somewhere just beyond my reach, there's someone reaching back for me<br />
Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat<br />
It's gonna take a Superman to sweep me off my feet, yeah  </p>
<p>[Chorus]<br />
I need a hero<br />
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night<br />
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast<br />
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight<br />
I need a hero (Hero)<br />
I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light (Hero till the morning light)<br />
He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon<br />
And he's gotta be larger than life<br />
I need a hero<br />
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night  </p>
<p>[Instrumental Break]  </p>
<p>[Bridge]<br />
Up where the mountains meet the heavens above<br />
Out where the lightning splits the sea<br />
I could swear there is someone somewhere watching me<br />
Through the wind and the chill and the rain<br />
And the storm and the flood<br />
I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood<br />
(Like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my blood)<br />
(Like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my blood, blood)<br />
[Chorus]<br />
I need a hero (Hero)<br />
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night<br />
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast<br />
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight<br />
I need a hero (Hero)<br />
I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light (Hero till the morning light)<br />
He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon<br />
And he's gotta be larger than life<br />
I need a hero (Hero)<br />
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night<br />
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast<br />
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight<br />
I need a hero (Hero)<br />
I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light (Hero till the morning light)<br />
He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon<br />
And he's gotta be larger than life<br />
I need a hero<br />
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night  </p>

<p>[Verse 1]<br />
Tell her I'll be waiting<br />
In the usual place<br />
With the tired and weary<br />
And there's no escape<br />
To need a woman<br />
You've got to know<br />
How the strong get weak<br />
And the rich get poor  </p>

Slave to love<br />
Oh, oh, slave to love  </p>
<p>[Verse 2]<br />
You're running with me<br />
Don't touch the ground<br />
We're the restless hearted<br />
Not the chained and bound<br />
The sky is burning<br />
A sea of flame<br />
Though your world is changing<br />
I will be the same  </p>

Oh oh, slave to love<br />

<p>[Verse 1: Agnetha Fältskog]<br />
I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through<br />
Though it's hurting me, now it's history<br />
I've played all my cards<br />
And that's what you've done, too<br />
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play  </p>
<p>[Chorus: Agnetha Fältskog]<br />
The winner takes it all<br />
The loser standing small<br />
Beside the victory<br />
That's her destiny  </p>
<p>[Verse 2: Agnetha Fältskog]<br />
I was in your arms, thinkin' I belonged there<br />
I figured it made sense building me a fence<br />
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there<br />
But I was a fool playing by the rules  </p>
<p>[Chorus: Agnetha Fältskog &amp; Anni-Frid Lingstad]<br />
The gods may throw a dice<br />
Their minds as cold as ice<br />
And someone way down here<br />
Loses someone dear<br />
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)<br />
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)<br />
It's simple and it's plain (Yes, it's plain)<br />
Why should I complain? (Why complain?)<br />

But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you?<br />
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?<br />
Somewhere deep inside, you must know I miss you<br />
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed  </p>
<p>[Chorus: Agnetha Fältskog &amp; Anni-Frid Lingstad]<br />
The judges will decide (They decide)<br />
The likes of me abide (We abide)<br />
Spectators of the show (Of the show)<br />
Always stayin' low (Staying low)<br />
The game is on again (On again)<br />
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)<br />
A big thing or a small (Big or small)<br />
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)  </p>
<p>[Bridge: Agnetha Fältskog]<br />
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad<br />
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand<br />
I apologise if it makes you feel bad<br />
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence<br />
But you see, the winner takes it all<br />
The winner takes it all  </p>
<p>[Outro: Anni-Frid Lingstad]<br />
(So the winner takes it all)<br />
(And the loser has to fall)<br />
(Throw a dice, cold as ice)<br />

<p>[Verse 1]<br />
Well, I'm standing by a river<br />
But the water doesn't flow<br />
It boils with every poison you can think of<br />
And I'm underneath the streetlights<br />
But the light of joy I know<br />
Scared beyond belief way down in the shadows<br />
And the perverted fear of violence<br />
Chokes a smile on every face<br />
And common sense is ringing out the bells<br />
This ain't no technological breakdown<br />
Oh no, this is the road to Hell  </p>
<p>[Guitar Solo]  </p>
<p>[Verse 2]<br />
And all the roads jam up with credit<br />
And there's nothing you can do<br />
It's all just bits of paper<br />
Flying away from you<br />
Oh, look out world take a good look<br />
What comes down here<br />
You must learn this lesson fast<br />
And learn it well<br />
This ain't no upwardly mobile freeway<br />
Oh no, this is the road<br />
Said this is the road<br />
This is the road to Hell  </p>

And the boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair<br />
While the shy, tormented youth sit way over there<br />
And the songs, they get louder, each one better than before  </p>
<p>[Chorus]<br />
And you're singin' the songs, thinkin' this is the life<br />
And you wake up in the mornin', and your head feels twice the size<br />
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go?<br />
Where you gonna sleep tonight?<br />
And you're singin' the songs, thinkin' this is the life<br />
And you wake up in the mornin', and your head feels twice the size<br />
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go?<br />
Where you gonna sleep tonight?<br />
Where you gonna sleep tonight?  </p>
<p>[Verse 2]<br />
So you're headin' down the road in your taxi for four<br />
And you're waitin' outside Jimmy's front door<br />
But nobody's in, and nobody's home till four<br />
So you're sittin' there with nothin' to do<br />
Talkin' about Robert Riger and his motley crew<br />
And where you gonna go, and where you gonna sleep tonight  </p>

Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen,<br />
Tonight we'll put all other things aside.<br />
Give in this time and show me some affection,<br />
We're going for those pleasures in the night.  </p>
<p>I want to love you, feel you,<br />
Wrap myself around you.<br />
I want to squeeze you, please you,<br />
I just can't get enough,<br />
And if you move real slow,<br />
I'll let it go.  </p>
<p>I'm so excited,<br />
And I just can't hide it,<br />
I'm about to lose control<br />
And I think I like it.<br />
I'm so excited,<br />
And I just can't hide it,<br />
And I know, I know, I know, I know<br />
I know I want you, want you.  </p>
<p>We shouldn't even think about tomorrow,<br />
Sweet memories will last a long long time.<br />
We'll have a good time baby don't you worry,<br />
And if we're still playing around boy that's just fine.  </p>
<p>Let's get excited,<br />
And we just can't hide it,<br />
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it.<br />
I'm so excited,<br />
And I just can't hide it,<br />
And I know, I know, I know, I know<br />
I know I want you, want you  </p>

<p>Such a feelin's coming over me<br />
There is wonder in most every thing I see<br />
Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes<br />
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream  </p>
<p>Everything I want the world to be<br />
Is now coming true especially for me<br />
And the reason is clear, it's because you are here<br />
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen  </p>
<p>I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation<br />
And the only explanation I can find<br />
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around<br />
Your love's put me at the top of the world  </p>
<p>Something in the wind has learned my name<br />
And it's telling me that things are not the same<br />
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze<br />
There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me  </p>
<p>There is only one wish on my mind<br />
When this day is through I hope that I will find<br />
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me<br />
All I need will be mine if you are here  </p>

<h2 id="the-sound-of-silence">The Sound of Silence</h2>
<p>Hello, darkness, my old friend,<br />
I've come to talk with you again<br />
Because a vision softly creeping,<br />
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,<br />
And the vision that was planted in my brain<br />
Still remains<br />
Within the sound of silence.  </p>
<p>In restless dreams I walked alone,<br />
Narrow streets of cobblestone,<br />
Neath the halo of a streetlamp,<br />
I turned my collar to the cold and damp,<br />
When my eyes were stabbed<br />
By the flash of the neon light,<br />
And split the night,<br />
And touched the sound of silence.  </p>
<p>And in the naked light I saw<br />
Ten thousand people, maybe more.<br />
People talking without speaking,<br />
People hearing without listening,<br />
People writing songs that voices never shared,<br />
And no one dared to stir the sound of silence.  </p>
<p>Fools, said I, you don't know,<br />
Silence like a cancer grows.<br />
Hear my words and I might teach you,<br />
Take my arms and I might reach you,<br />
But my words like silent raindrops fell,<br />
And echoed<br />
In the wells of silence.  </p>
<p>And the people bowed and prayed<br />
To the neon god they'd made,<br />
And the sign flashed its warning<br />
In the words that it was forming,<br />
And the sign sayed the words of the prophets are written<br />
On the subway walls and tenement halls,<br />
And whispered in the sound of silence.  </p>
